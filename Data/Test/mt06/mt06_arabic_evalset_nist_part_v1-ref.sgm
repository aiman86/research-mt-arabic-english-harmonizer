</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Oslo 2-6 (AFP) - Terje Roed-Larsen, the former United Nations Middle East envoy, considered the situation in the region as having never been as dangerous as it is today and compared the region to a "powder keg with a lit fuse". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Roed-Larsen, speaking to the Norwegian NRK radio station said that "the region can now be compared in several respects to a powder keg with a lit fuse." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added "I think the situation is more difficult, complicated and dangerous than it has been for a number of decades." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Among the existing and potential crises in the Middle East, Roed-Larsen mentioned the Arab-Israeli dispute, the Iranian nuclear portfolio and the crisis between Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He said that "all this brings us back to issues of fundamental values and opinions which make the situation more likely to get out of control at any moment than it has been in the last few days." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Roed-Larsen did not openly mention the acts of violence that permeated demonstrations in the Muslim world in protest against the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in the European press, limiting himself to emphasizing the need for "dialogue" rather than "throwing stones and lighting fires." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Demonstrators set fire to the Danish and Norwegian embassy buildings in Damascus on Saturday while a building housing the Danish embassy in Beirut was set on fire in response to the publication of the caricatures in September in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten and their subsequent republication in the European media, led by the Norwegian magazine Magazinet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Roed-Larsen is currently in charge of monitoring the implementation of Security Council resolution 1559 which stipulates the disarmament of militias and armed groups in Lebanon, including, in the international organization's opinion, the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and Palestinian groups. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Dubai 2-7 (AFP) - The Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan said he would donate the international Zayed Prize for the Environment, which he received on Monday night in Dubai worth 500,000 dollars, to set up a foundation for agriculture and educating girls in Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Annan said at the prize-giving ceremony that he had decided "to use the prize to set up a foundation that I will establish in Africa to work in the fields of agriculture and educating girls." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He said that he chose "agriculture because Africa's people need a green revolution and girls' education because there is no more effective tool for development." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Zayed international prize for the Environment, launched in 1998 and named after the founder of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, is awarded once every two years to distinguished individuals in the field of environmental protection.

<p>
<seg id="2"> Brussels 2-7 (AFP) - The mayor of Middelkerke in west Belgium Michel Landuyt told Agence France Presse that he decided to ban a controversial piece of art depicting the ousted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in chains by the avant-garde Czech artist David Cerny, saying it was "shocking". </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> The artwork entitled "Shark" shows Saddam Hussein handcuffed and suspended in a tank filled with liquid. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> Michel Landuyt said, "In my view, (the piece) was shocking." He pointed out that Saddam Hussein is currently standing trial, with the proceedings being shown on television. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "Shark" was shown for the first time at the Prague 2 international exhibition, held every two years and which took place between May and September 2005. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Diskin told students at a religious institute for semi-military training, "I'm telling you quite openly that if a Jew carries out a terrorist act, he will be considered a cancer in the state and represents a much bigger threat than Hamas", referring to the Islamic Resistance Movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Diskin made these statements around a month ago but his speech, recorded a month ago, was not shown until Monday night on Israeli "Channel 10". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He added, "I want to tell you that we will pursue with equal severity a Jewish terrorist who kills an Arab or an Arab who kills a Jew." However, he admitted that an Arab would "receive harsher treatment than a Jew committing the same acts." </seg>

<seg id="6"> He expressed his deep concern about the "fundamentalist streak" among young settlers who are being drawn into violence to express their opposition to the dismantling of settlements. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Hamas Rejects What Some Fatah Groups See as Exposing the Palestinian National Project to Danger </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Taher Al-Majthoub </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (repeat with clarification in the fourth paragraph) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ramallah (West Bank) 2-8 (AFP) - A number of circles in the Fatah movement have expressed their fears that the Palestinian national project may be exposed to danger with the Islamic resistance movement Hamas taking over the reins of the Palestinian Authority. However, the Islamic movement vehemently rejected this suggestion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Adnan Al-Dhumeiri, a Fatah leader in the West Bank, told the France Presse news agency that "Hamas, as part of the worldwide Muslim Brotherhood movement, is not as concerned with questions of Palestinian statehood as it is with the issue of Islamic nationhood." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He said that "The other side is that the Hamas resistance movement can be compared to the Taliban and Chechen movements and this is what sets it apart from other Islamic movements in the Arab and Muslim world, but Hamas has not carried out any operations outside the borders of Palestine." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Al-Dhumeiri, who was a Fatah movement candidate in the recent elections but did not win, viewed the differences between Hamas and Fatah as "Fatah has an agenda that stipulates continued negotiation efforts to establish a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital based on the 1967 border. Fatah sees this solution as strategic while Hamas sees it as being a stage." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On the same note, a Palestinian official who wished to remain anonymous said that Hamas "belongs to an Islamic movement that is not as concerned with establishing a state as much as it cares about establishing an Islamic Caliphate and so its interests may coincide with those of Tehran and Damascus. It is a candidate for alliance with Hizbollah in Lebanon and Iran and with the Muslim Brotherhood in other countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He added, "Even Syria may make use of it within the framework of its policy aimed at using the Palestinian and Lebanese causes as a card to pressurize Israel, especially as the Baath party also regards the statehood question as a joint one in terms of Arab nationalism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In the end, if Hamas agrees to a ceasefire with Israel for a period of 10 or 15 years, it may back down on the issue of liberation and focus on imposing an Islamic agenda on society, according to him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> More than one Hamas official has said that the Islamic movement is preparing to set up a new Palestinian government ready to enter into a long-term ceasefire with Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In an interview with France Presse, Hamas deputy Mahmoud Al-Ramhi strongly denied that Hamas might be endangering the Palestinian national agenda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He said, "This claim is not based on truth and Israel's unilateral policy began before Hamas won, when Fatah was in power, because the Oslo Accords (1994) did not specify when the settlements would end nor the borders of the Palestinian state", and consequently the movement bears no responsibility in terms of endangering the Palestinian agenda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He also added that Israel had decided, within the framework of the same unilateral policy," to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and build the separation wall before Hamas won, and even before the date the legislative elections were set and before Hamas' decision to take part in them". He stated that "Israel does not comply with any of the agreements reached and negotiation has not put an end to this. The only solution is to carry on the resistance." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The head of the Hamas movement's political bureau, Khalid Mashaal, announced today, Wednesday, that the movement could well comply with a "long ceasefire" with Israel in the event of it withdrawing to the 1967 borders and "recognizing the rights of" the Palestinians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Al-Ramhi said, "The ceasefire with its conditions are the creation of a Palestinian state with the 1967 borders including East Jerusalem and the release of detainees". He said that "if we cannot achieve these conditions and if Israel does not release any prisoners and does not withdraw from the West Bank, then Hamas will not be bound by the Cairo agreement." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Ahmed Sadat, secretary-general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told France Presse from prison in Jericho, "We are not afraid of any Palestinian side abandoning the Palestinian project because the battle is essentially against Israeli occupation and we have not heard about the Hamas movement abandoning any of the fundamental principles of the Palestinian cause nor of it being under any allegiance or program."." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He said that "the commitment to these principles and resisting occupation are common denominators" and "the resistance is linked to the existence of occupation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Sadat added, "We look forward to what Hamas has to offer. What is needed from all forces in Palestinian society is a democratic vision and internal consensus as an initial step in electing members of the legislative council. The second step is in the form of our citizens abroad taking part through direct elections." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It should be pointed out that both the Popular Front and Hamas reject the Oslo Accords and the road map plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Bassam Al-Salihi, a deputy with the parliamentary alternative bloc (People's party, left wing) said that "it is premature to come out with general or hasty conclusions for a number of reasons, one of which is that Hamas' victory does not necessarily mean a loss of political balance." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> He called for "a review of the results because support for Hamas in the Palestinian street is no more than half the electorate, 40%", adding that "I think the Liberation Organization's program, independence, international legitimacy and the Arab peace initiative, are backed by the majority on the Palestinian street." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Al-Salihi said, "It's hard for any political movement to reach agreements that do not live up to this program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Al-Salihi pointed out that his bloc "is thinking about proposing a draft project to the Legislative Council or the Central Committee declaring the 1967 border as the border for the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and calling for the world to recognize this [...] because the issue of borders is not a matter for negotiation but a matter of dispute." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Al-Salihi stated that "we believe that the priority is to rebuild the Palestinian democratic movement on clearer bases in the political and social context and that the foundation must be the independence pact because this is what defines a social vision of the political system based on a secular system." </seg>

<seg id="2"> Tokyo 2-8 (AFP) - Japanese company Suzuki has said that it will shortly announce its plans to take part in the World Rally Championship without disclosing details about the matter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> David Farquhar, press director and head of the Japanese company's public relations division, said that the announcement would be made on the fringes of the Geneva car exhibition at the end of this month. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Suzuki has taken part in many rallies outside these classes, in preparation for formally joining the adult class in the world championship. These expectations were reinforced by its announcement today that it is to make a decision on this matter on the 28th of this month (2 o'clock Geneva time). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If it decides to take part, this will constitute strong backing for the championship, especially since two French companies Citroen - world champion for the past three years - and Peugeot, Japanese Mitsubishi, Czech Skoda and Korean Hyundai have backed out of formal participation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Citroen will return to the world championship next year with a new car, the C4, in place of the Xsara, although it offers semi-official support for the Belgian company Kronos Racing (Citroen Xsara) and its driver, Frenchman Sebastien Loeb, world champion for the last two years, and his Spanish colleague Xavier Pons. It also backs fellow citizen Daniel Sordo, champion of the Junior WRC champion last year and who is following in Loeb's footsteps who was crowned champion in this class before moving onto the adult class. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The number of official manufacturers in the championship will rise to four in the event of Suzuki joining and Citroen returning next year, alongside Subaru and Ford which won the first two stages of the championship this year with its new driver, Finnish Marcus Gronholm. Other participants in the Special Events include the Finn Tony Gardemeister (Astra Racing - Peugeot 307)who was absent from the Swedish rally after winning third place in Monaco, Frenchman Gilles Panizzi (Red Bull - Skoda) and the Italian Gigi Galli who is taking part privately (Mitsubishi Lancer W 2005). </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Sanaa 11-2 (AFP) - Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh reshuffled his cabinet today, Saturday, according to the Yemeni news agency SABA, following the escape of 23 suspected Al-Qaida members from a Yemeni prison last week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Yemeni president decided to keep Prime Minister Abdulqadir Bajammal as head of government and dismissed Defense Minister Abdullah Ali Elewa and 15 other ministers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Yemeni president dismissed the two deputy prime ministers, Alawi Al-Salami and Ahmed Sufan who held the posts of Finance Minister and Planning Minister respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Interior Minister Rashad Al-Alimi held his post as well as becoming the sole deputy prime minister. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The escaped prisoners include 13 prisoners sentenced for the bombing of the American destroyer Cole and French oil tanker Limburg, the most prominent escapee being Jamal Al-Badawi who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for the bombing of the American destroyer in which 17 American soldiers were killed. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Baghdad 2-13 (AFP) - Former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and his seven colleagues caused chaos today, Monday, during their 11th trial hearing, insulting and interrupting the judge whom they accused of forcing them to attend court in spite of the absence of their defense counsel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Saddam Hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue robe and black jacket. As he entered, he repeated the words "Down with traitors, down with traitors, down with Bush, long live the nation, long live the nation, long live the nation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The former president told the judge he had been forced to enter the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This was followed by a chaotic situation in which the defendants objected to having to attend court by force. Barzan Ibrahim Al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's half-brother, shouted at Judge Raouf Rasheed Abdulrahman, "You have no mercy and your name in no way describes you. You are neither a praiseworthy Mahmoud nor a compassionate Raouf. You are a military ruler and not a judge. We do not want to sit in this place." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He added, "I can't continue with this session without my lawyer." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He went on to say that he was suffering from "an incurable disease and I've had medical tests by the Americans at the American military base. You have to let me go so that I can have treatment because the law states that a defendant with an incurable disease must be released. I am dying slowly, you are killing me." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> When the judge informed him that the court had agreed to his being examined by a medical panel, he said, "If you fear God, release me so that I can have treatment with my family to support me. I will sign any undertaking to pledge that I will attend the hearings. I have honor and want to defend my honor." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> He went on to say, "But if you think the Baath Party needs me, I want to tell you that the Baath Party is working perfectly well and doesn't need me or anyone else and its secretary-general (pointing to Saddam Hussein) has been in prison for two years so release me so I can have treatment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The judge replied, "You have talked a lot and used up a lot of the court's time." Barzan interrupted him saying "I have the right to talk until tomorrow." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> After that, Barzan Al-Tikriti noticed that the judge was ignoring his pleas for release. He got up from his chair and sat on the floor, turning his back on the judge and ignoring the court hearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> ٍSaddam, who appeared to be angry and carried a Koran in his hands, swore at the judge for forcing him to attend the hearing. He said, "This is the practice of agents, God is great and may the despicable be driven away, God curse your mustache." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> He added, "This is not a court, this is a game." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Saddam told the judge, "You have no right to appoint lawyers for us instead of our lawyers, with all due respect to them because they agreed to defend us, and with respect to every Iraqi." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The judge stated that "the court appointed lawyers to replace the defense team in accordance with Iraqi law after the defense layers boycotted the hearings." Saddam answered him saying "they did not boycott the hearings, it is you who threw them out and some of them were beaten up in front of you." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Judge Abdulrahman replied, "I will not allow you to talk about political matters." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saddam interrupted him saying "You are ignorant. What politics? You are working in a biased way and in breach of the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> He then heard the testimonies of various witnesses who talked about what they endured at the hands of the security services after being arrested in 1982. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Saddam Hussein made an objection. He said to the presiding judge, "When witnesses talk about politics, this is allowed, but when Saddam Hussein and his colleagues talk about political matters, this is prohibited." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Saddam Hussein, his former aides and the defense counsel boycotted the court's 10th hearing and withdrew from the previous hearing following an altercation  with the new judge who took over presidency of the Special Court, Raouf Rasheed Abdulrahman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Lawyer Khalil Al-Dulaimi, head of Saddam Hussein's defense team, had told France Presse news agency in a telephone call on Sunday that "in my capacity as head of the defense team, I can confirm that none of the defense team nor the defendants will attend today's court hearing." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Jafar Al-Mosawi, the court's public prosecutor, stated that "the court will hold a meeting prior to the court hearing to look into the possibility of forcibly making the defendants appear or leaving them be if they insist on not attending." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> He considered that "if the court reaches a decision, then this has to be implemented regardless of what that decision is." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Saddam Hussein and his aides have been on trial since last October for the killing of 148 people in the Shiite village of Dujail in retaliation against an attack on the former Iraqi president's escort during his visit to the village in 1982. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Iran Confirms that it has Resumed its Uranium Enrichment Operations (summary) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Siyavush Ghazi </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tehran 2-14 (AFP) - Today, Tuesday, Tehran confirmed that it has resumed its uranium enrichment operations at the Natnaz plant and refused to put on hold its "research" in this area while western countries have stipulated that this process must stop before negotiations with Tehran can be resumed on the issue of Tehran's nuclear program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Javad Waidi, member of the Supreme Council for National Security and in charge of the nuclear dossier, announced that "work has started" at the uranium enrichment plant in Natnaz (center). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Monday, Tehran announced the removal of the seals and monitoring cameras belonging to the International Atomic Energy Commission from the Natnaz plant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Diplomatic sources in Vienna, the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Commission, announced that Iran had resumed the enrichment program at that plant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> However, Waidi declined to comment on statements saying that the Iranians had begun enrichment work by adding uranium hexafluoride gas into the centrifuge system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He told journalists, after a speech to a Tehran Muslim students' association, "I cannot give you an answer about these technical matters." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Resumption of the enrichment process itself led to talks with the Europeans being cut off last August, then in January after they were resumed in December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> These countries took a decision on 4th February at the International Atomic Energy Commission to ask Iran to suspend all sensitive activities and informed the Security Council of the Iranian dossier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> However, instead of complying, Tehran responded by announcing the end of reinforced monitoring of its nuclear program set up by the International Atomic Energy Commission and the resumption of all activities, especially those connected with enrichment on a large scale. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Natnaz plant includes two enrichment units, one of which focuses on research while the second is an industrial-scale installation under construction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> With regard to this unit, Waidi said that Iran "needs time to complete its industrial capacity with about 60,000 centrifuges (to enrich uranium) but we have started our activities". He said that his country saw "no reason at the present time to make further comments" about its activities at this site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Waidi justified the series of unilateral initiatives by his country saying that "the Europeans, after starting with good intentions over the past three years, are now asking us to completely abandon the nuclear power series". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Europeans reject Iran enriching uranium on its territory because they regard this country as not having proved that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The enrichment process is fundamental to obtaining nuclear power but can also be used to make nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The International Atomic Energy Commission is expected to hold another meeting on March 6th to look into whether Iran has complied with its requirements and will probably decide to refer the file to the Security Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the meantime, an Iranian delegation is visiting Moscow on February 20th according to Waidi to examine a Russian proposal to enrich Iranian uranium on its territory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> However, this proposal is dependent on the position of the Iranians who are carrying out the enrichment process on their territory which is what western countries object to. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Nasser Abu Bakr </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Ramallah (West Bank) 15-2 (AFP) - The Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization today, Wednesday, regarded the expansion of Israeli settlements as wrecking opportunities to achieve peace in the region and reiterated its full commitment to all agreements signed with the Israeli government under international patronage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A statement by the Executive Committee at the close of a meeting today at the headquarters in Ramallah, presided over by the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, a copy of which was sent to Agency France Press, said that "the Executive Committee is reflecting on the attack targeted at the Al-Aghwar area in an Israeli attempt to isolate this area from the rest of the Palestinian Territories on the West Bank under blatant security and expansionist pretexts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It stated its "outright rejection of these settlement plans which are tearing up our Palestinian land into isolated cantons to stop our people from establishing an independent state." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The statement went on to say that "the Executive Committee has turned to the quadripartite committee that created the road map to inform it of our position on this creeping settlement on our land and the need for it to play its role in the peace process and the two-state (establishment) solution." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It went on to say that "the continued settlement of Holy Jerusalem, the racist separation wall and isolation of the Al-Aghwar area in an attempt to make it Jewish, as well as the crimes of assassination, violations and detentions only wreck any chance of establishing a just and permanent peace in the Middle East." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added, "It has been decided to hold a meeting of the Supreme Council under Saleem Al-Zanoun(Abu Al-Adib), president of Ramallah's national council, this week to discuss current preparations for convening the Central Palestinian Council and to approve plans and decisions prepared by the Supreme Council to activate the organization, the executive committee and specific departments." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The statement said the committee "discussed the forthcoming meeting of the Palestinian Legislative Council to be held on Saturday" and declared a "total commitment to all national principles approved by successive Palestinian national councils, as well as commitment to the Palestinian Liberation Organization's political program and the 1988 declaration of independence." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> It confirmed "its total commitment to all political agreements signed with the government of Israel under international patronage as well as abiding by international legal resolutions relating to the Palestinian issue, especially resolution 194 concerning the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the decisions of the Arab summit in Beirut." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The statement said that "all Palestinian bodies must play their political and national roles, at the forefront of which are the legislative and executive bodies, in order to ensure our national interests and international recognition of the Organization, the Authority and the higher interests of our people." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Salih Rafaat, member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's Executive Committee, told the France Presse news agency in a statement that "the Committee has decided to start a wide scale diplomatic campaign on the Arab and international front, including the Security Council, the quadripartite committee and signatory countries of the Geneva conventions, in order to challenge the Israeli policy aimed at concealing settlements in the Al-Aghwar area and unilaterally drawing up the border." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He added, "The Executive Committee confirms that members of the Legislative Council are members of the National Council. With this, the Hamas movement enters the Palestinian National Council which is considered to be the Palestinian Liberation Organization's parliament and this also qualifies it to join all the Organization's institutions which the Hamas movement was previously cautious about joining." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He went on to say, "The Executive Committee has discussed President Abbas' speech which he is to make at the Legislative Council's inauguration ceremony next Saturday." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Strange Laws Give England a Hilarious Side </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Jalal Malti </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London 2-17 (AFP) - England has a set of old laws and traditions, some of which are strange and some of which are funny, that are still in force even if they are not applied but in any case, law students find them hilarious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> One of these laws is a law dating back to 1279 which stipulates that "members of parliament are not permitted to wear armor" inside parliament. This law was aimed at preventing feuds and fights ending in death between lords in a country with deep democratic roots. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Another strange law prohibits members of parliament from dying in Westminster Palace and should this happen, then the corpse had to be carried outside parliament before a death certificate can be issued. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Nigel Cawthorne, editor of a book called Strange Laws of Old England which reviews these amazing regulations forgotten by time, says that the reasoning behind this law is that Westminster Palace is a royal palace and everyone who dies in a palace has the right to a formal funeral." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Members of parliament are also allowed to gamble and drink alcohol freely in Westminster including inside the library while citizens would incur a fine for such behavior according to the Library Breaches law (1898). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In England, there are over 4000 national laws, 11,000 bylaws and 13,000 special laws passed before 1801 and which are still in force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Cawthorne told Agency France Press news agency that "the legal tradition is very important" in England, saying that "things change but very slowly and (laws) come one after another." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The fact is that members of parliament legislated many aspects of daily life, some of them very ordinary and in the 19th century, at the height of the industrial revolution, they issued a number of laws aimed at organizing life in the suburbs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This attention to detail led for example to the prohibition of washing being hung out in the street, firing a gun without a reason, lighting a fire in the garden, flying kites, ice-skating, disturbing residents by knocking on their door without a reason, lighting street lights "intentionally and illegally" and other laws that are now regarded as hilarious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some of these laws have not been implemented for a long time because of the progress made since they were issued, the funniest of which is not being allowed to ride a horse, cow or steam car in an inebriated state (1872). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A law dating back to 1867 also prohibits anyone "living less than a mile from an ammunition or explosives depot" from owning a pack of cards while a law issued in 1839 stipulates that anyone firing a canon near a house should be punished. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Kevin Martin, president of the Law Society responsible for suggesting laws that ought to be annulled, says that "these unusual examples give us an idea about the tradition of law in this country and also prove the need to renew the law and adapt to reality." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> More than 2000 laws have been annulled since 1965 in a massive operation to update laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, British members of parliament insist on continuing to issue strange laws such as the "outer space law" (1986) which prohibits any British citizen from "throwing a body into space" without official permission and defines space as including the "moon and the majority of celestial bodies." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> They also deemed it wise to give judges the power to issue orders "to use a reasonable amount of force" in hitting back against a possible invasion by aliens. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Baghdad 2-17 (AFP) - Three days after Valentine's Day, a Sunni Imam launched an attack, during his Friday sermon, on Valentine's Day and those celebrating it in Iraq, saying that it "diverts young people from virtue to sin." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Most Imams in Iraqi mosques focused their Friday sermons on images of prisoner abuse dating back to 2004 while others focused on poor services and the difficult security situation in the country, however Sheikh Mahmoud Al-Sumeidi, Imam of the Umm Al-Qura Mosque, focused on Valentine's Day which is celebrated throughout the world on the 14th of this month and saw it as bearing no relation to Islam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He said, "International Valentine's Day happened two or three days ago, and unfortunately many of our young men and women on this day do what our enemies like, and exchanged gifts and words, even to the point of kissing. This is how our enemies want us to live, far removed from virtue." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Valentine's Day is a very popular day in Iraq, just as it is in other countries in the world, in which young people give their girlfriends chocolates, flowers, perfumes and other gifts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Al-Sumeidi added, "Every invasion has an aim and the invasion of our country targets our young people and wants to divert them from virtue to sin." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The celebration of this occasion in Iraq goes back to before the American invasion in 2003. A big celebration was held on this occasion during the era of ousted president Saddam Hussein's regime and state television would show programs dedicated to the occasion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Iraqi president's son, Uday, was known to hold big parties on Valentine's Day, in the Hunting Club in the sophisticated Mansour area, which used to go on until the early hours of the morning. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Rome 2-17 (AFP) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi today, Friday, signed a political agreement seven weeks prior to the legislative elections with the neo-Fascist Social Alternative movement led by Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Berlusconi said in the presence of Mussolini, "We have reached an agreement on the agenda between the House of Liberties (ruling alliance) and Social Alternative", broadening his election alliance to include the far right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The alliance with Social Alternative in preparation for the elections on April 19th angered the rest of Berlusconi's alliance because of the inclusion of controversial figures allied with the far-right neo-Fascist movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Berlusconi said that "our family photo album is perfect, it's pure white." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A solution was reached when Mussolini and her two irritating allies Roberto Fiore, leader of Forza Nuova (New Force), and Adriano Tilgher, leader of the National Social Front, decided not to personally stand as candidates on the alliance list and nominated other candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democratic left (biggest opposition party) said today that "it is a very dangerous matter indeed, to have Berlusconi sign agreements with the neo-Fascist far right." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Ignazio La Russa, leader of the National Alliance (conservative right wing party which sprung out of the Fascist movement), the second party in Berlusconi's alliance, said that in spite of the Social Alternative leaders withdrawing their candidacy, "the basic problem remains which is a split in basic values and the political agenda." </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Brussels 2-17 (AFP) - A new study by Belgian researchers called "The Growth of Terrorism in 2005" reports that Muslims are the biggest victims of terrorism committed in the name of Islam and that international terrorism strikes the Middle East more often than the West. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On the other hand, the study showed that 90% of victims of terrorism in 2005 were killed in Iraq and Jordan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This study was led by Rick Kolsat, lecturer in international relations at Ghent University in west Belgium and was published on the government's "Economy" internet site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to the study, the number of international terrorist acts fell considerably in 2005 compared to 2004, in which 266 attacks killed 443 people in 2004 versus 393 attacks killing 733 people in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The study regarded terrorism as not being a widespread danger since it is essentially concentrated in one region, the Middle East. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand, "local" terrorism perpetrated by the citizens of a country against targets in their own country increased considerably between 2004 and 2005 with the number of attacks rising by 90% and a 60% increase in the number of victims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The study attributed this increase almost entirely to the situation in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It also said that "the conflict in Iraq, presented as being a factor in the war on terrorism, contributed to making Iraq the current center for terrorism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Citing these figures, Rick Kolsat said in a telephone conversation, "Imagine how the Muslim world views these figures when the West insists that it is the one threatened by terrorism?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study revealed that "the concept that suggests that international terrorism is basically an external threat is not supported by fact." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the same note, Kolsat said that "Jihad-based terrorism is not the existential danger we perceive it to be, although it is a challenge to our societies." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Berlusconi Faces Difficulty in Sacking Minister Accused of Insulting Islam </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Christian Spielmann </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rome 2-18 (AFP) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi battled with his allies in the Northern League today, Saturday, to be allowed to sack one of his top men, Reform Minister Roberto Calderoli, in order to ease tensions caused by his offensive statements about Islam in the Muslim world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Prime Minister asked Calderoli to resign but stressed on the same day, Saturday, that he had "no authority to force him" to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The minister in question responded by saying that he was prepared to resign "if Umberto Bossi (leader of the Northern League) asks me to do so and if the Muslim world makes a conciliatory gesture." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Italian minister is accused of insulting Islam by wearing a T-shirt with the offensive cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed which led to a dangerous international crisis. He wore the T-shirt on Thursday and appeared in it on the evening news on Italy's Channel "RAI Uno". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This action and further accusations against Islam he made in press statements on Friday led to violent anti-Italian demonstrations in Libya in which 10 people were killed on Friday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Roberto Calderoli does not intend to apologize. The newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported today, Saturday, that he said "I don't feel responsible for those deaths." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He stressed in a statement to the newspaper La Repubblica that "western civilization is under threat." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Silvio Berlusconi caused shock waves in the Muslim world when he stated that "western civilization is superior". This was on September 26, 2001, two weeks after the attacks in the United States. He faced a great deal of difficulty in making amends for these statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Calderoli (49 years old), a former specialist maxillofacial surgeon, is seen as an extremely conservative member of the Northern League, a movement that is against foreigners and allied to Berlusconi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He came into the government in July 2004 to replace Bossi, the leader of the League, who was forced to resign after a heart attack. The League runs three ministries: the Justice, Labor and Reform Ministries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Roberto Calderoli says he enjoys the support of Umberto Bossi and his party, as well as "the support of many who think like me." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He bragged to La Repubblica newspaper, "Silvio Berlusconi has asked for my resignation but I haven't resigned yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Italian authorities fear more anti-Italian demonstrations today, Saturday, in the Muslim world in addition to repercussions in Italy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Berlusconi announced that he had asked Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisano to provide security for the Northern League's offices and said that "protective measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Italian missions abroad." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianfranco Fini, announced his intention to visit a mosque in Rome today, Saturday, in an effort to ease the tension caused by Calderoli's statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> This is not the first time the prime minister has clashed with the Northern League in asking for the resignation of one of its ministers from government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In July 2003, he was forced to negotiate with Umberto Bossi on the matter of the resignation of Tourism Minister Stefano Stefani who made offensive statements about German tourists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The confrontation lasted a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with Germany which were in trouble anyway because of insults Silvio Berlusconi made personally about a German deputy whom he compared to a Nazi prison guard. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Solana Caught Between his Heart and Mind. By Nureddine Ashour </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The current trip by the European Union's Foreign Policy Coordinator Javier Solana does not bring up the question of the possibility of it succeeding as much as it begs the question of whether he turned to his mind or his heart when he volunteered to try and calm Muslim public opinion following the publication of offensive cartoons of the Prophet in a number of European newspapers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As Solana is currently in the Middle East, it seems that he has turned to his heart after feeling offended by the publication of the cartoons and he feels what Muslims feel towards the insult directed at them in the name of freedom of expression because he did not hesitate in stating that "the European Union has a profound respect for Muslims... </seg>
<seg id="4"> and did not want to hurt their feelings." </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is part of what the European official said after his recent meeting with the Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Had the European Foreign Policy Coordinator preferred to follow (and this is just an assumption) his mind, he would not have bothered himself with going to the Middle East, whether to apologize or "convince" and the crisis would have been resolved in a European context since Denmark is a member of the European Union and its economic interests risk being damaged... </seg>
<seg id="7"> Is it logical that one side should rush to the oppressed to calm and soothe him before condemning the oppressor and making him understand that what has been done is unacceptable? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Was Hitler left free and unfettered during World War II to implement his aggressive plans and racist ideas, with the Allies limiting themselves to commiserating with the Europeans, including the Jews? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> What is most dangerous in the matter is that there are efforts to convince Muslims of the sincerity of the European attitude which has still not negated the pretext of freedom of expression in the debate on the publication of the cartoons, yet this does not resolve the crisis and some have paid with their lives for protesting against the cartoons. In the end, Europe has succeeded in achieving two things, the first of which is to soften the situation and keep it within the framework of freedom of publication and the other is to have exported the crisis to Muslim countries for it to be reduced to chaos and violence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This is why the mere fact of Solana being transformed into the one who is making conciliatory gestures to the Muslim world tells us that the European Union has not fully understood the feelings of Muslims who do not deny the right to expression but do not want it to be a means of inciting hatred and violating religious sensibilities. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When we hear of a European law being issued which criminalizes attacks on religion and sacred beliefs, then Solana's efforts will be truly welcome. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Lakhdhar Brahimi and Iraq's Mandela. By Asiya Latrousse </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Given that acknowledging failure and admitting defeat have never found their way into the dictionary of international diplomacy in general or Arab diplomacy in particular, especially when it is related to the war on Iraq, or the incidents, accompanying circumstances and secrets that have surrounded and surrounds it, which may not be revealed for a long time, what Lakhdar Brahimi, the experienced Algerian diplomat has said about his impossible task in Iraq cannot pass by without attracting interest or inviting reflection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> And because Lakhdar Brahimi is also practically the only Arab and North African diplomat who has agreed to engage in the adventure from close up and took on a mission that was not free from danger, either personally or career-wise, by going to an Arab country after its invasion and destruction. So it is perfectly natural, in view of the dangerous developments in the Iraqi arena over the past two and a half years, that his mission should give rise to a great deal of controversy about the reasons and motives that might push a man of Brahimi's importance and experience to agree to take on a role under the American occupation administration when he had taken a clear stand from the start and did not hesitate to admit that the decision to go to war was made outside the framework of international law. Lakhdar Brahimi had previously linked the success of his mission in South Africa during the apartheid era with the presence of a leader such as Mandela who was able to set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and unite his people around him to achieve a dream that had seemed almost impossible a few years earlier... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> NO doubt that when Brahimi, the former advisor to the United Nations Secretary-General, whose career in various areas of diplomacy and efforts in many crises in developing countries cannot be underestimated, comes back and admits the failure of his mission and sets out the reasons and types of mistakes made away from the rigidity and mortal arrogance, then he will have taken off the cloak of the obstinate and unyielding diplomat who knows he is mistaken but refuses to admit it and insists on continuing along an erroneous path because pride and haughtiness prevent him from doing so in spite of his awareness of the possible repercussions and dangers of this... </seg>
<seg id="5"> . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In an interview with an Arab newspaper, Brahimi admitted his failure in his mission in Iraq which he described as impossible given the many vetoes he faced while carrying out his mission. Brahimi, who had and still has a reputation for difficult missions, does not deny his feelings of discomfort at having accepted to work for the occupier in Iraq and in such difficult circumstances. He considers that what drove him to accept this mission at that time was the American administration's promise that it intended to end the occupation as quickly as possible, something that is not true now that it has become apparent that what the American administration cares about is not so much about finding a solution to the current situation as it is about finding a solution to the problem it has created for itself in Iraq, especially in the face of American public opinion which knows that the reasons given by the White House administration to justify the war were fictitious and based on false reports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Perhaps the reasons that drove Brahimi to acknowledge failure are not limited to only one reason but to a series of reasons, the most significant of which is his realization that invasion anywhere will bring resistance and resistance brings oppression, torture, imprisonment, secret prisons and that in any case, the military option cannot be the required solution in Iraq... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Brahimi's admission reflects a reality that has existed in Iraq for many months, not in terms of the size of material losses and destruction but more importantly in terms of the size of human losses, psychological wounds, loss and displacement in the absence of an effective national figure capable of bringing the Iraqis together and uniting them, an extremely important matter in the current situation and in overcoming the obstacles at the next stage... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> So is it possible that after all the suffering the Iraqis have endured to re-examine the incorrect strategy in Iraq to salvage what can be salvaged and to give the Iraqis a chance to regain their sovereignty, away from recommendations and solutions imported in cans of democracy? </seg>

<seg id="1"> News Analysis: After Hamas' Victory and its Alliance with Damascus, Tehran and Moscow: Will Washington Back Down from its Political Projects in the Arab World? </seg>
<seg id="2"> By Kamal Bin Yunus </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tunisia - Al-Sabah - Pressure on the American administration has increased, after Hamas won the Palestinian parliamentary elections, to persuade it to give up its projects aimed at political and economic reform in the Greater Middle East - i.e. in the Arab Islamic world from Morocco to Indonesia - so that the "radical current" made up of enemies of Washington and the West does not benefit from these elections... </seg>
<seg id="4"> especially as all American and European opinion polls </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> suggest the likelihood of increased feelings of opposition to the policies of the United States and Atlantic capitals within Arab and Muslim public opinion because of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the American administration and the majority of Western governments aligning themselves with Sharon's government throughout the campaign to suppress the Palestinian nation and its leaders over the past five years... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the British newspaper the Financial Times, President George Bush's administration "is currently reviewing its stated plans to spread democracy in the Middle East region after the overwhelming victory of the Hamas Islamic movement in the recent Palestinian legislative elections." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The newspaper reported that neo-Conservatives close to the American president have started to back down from plans to spread democracy in the Middle East after the overwhelming victory by the Hamas movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added that since the results of these elections were announced, "a flurry of reports and studies have been pouring in to the Bush administration advising it to take its time and slow down on the issue of spreading democracy in the Middle East." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Ending the pressure on regimes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Many recommendations have been made by conservative research centers and think-tanks which support the Republican administration in the White House calling on it "not to put pressure on Arab regimes" and to stop backing "the tendency to impose the model of democratization in Eastern Europe on countries in the Muslim world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Opponents of democratization in the Muslim Arab world link the Hamas victory to the election gains made by the fundamentalist movement in the Iranian elections and to Muslim Brotherhood candidates winning five seats in parliament for the first time in Egypt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Security and military alliance </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the Financial Times and many European and American sources, "in spite of the criticisms made by the administration of the Egyptian regime because of its legal violations during the last legislative elections", the American budget for 2007 expects to see an increase in the amount of military and security aid to Cairo since it sees it as "an ally in the war on terror."... </seg>
<seg id="14"> In other words, Washington and its European allies' priority will be security rather than politics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Hamas' alliance with Washington's enemies </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> This debate, which will continue in the European and American media, will be heightened by several issues including: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> * The backing of certain countries, which Washington and some European capitals regard as major enemies, for the Hamas movement (and its forthcoming government), particularly Syria, Iran, Sudan, Russia and Venezuela, with the list possibly increasing to include other countries such as Cuba, Korea, China and several Arab and Muslim countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> * The objective alliance between Tehran, Moscow, Beijing and many European and Asian countries against sanctions on Iran because of the Iranian nuclear portfolio, </seg>
<seg id="19"> and Tehran's foreign policy after Ahmadinejad's victory and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement led by Mohammed Khatami and former Culture Minister Mahajrani. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> * The failure of most of Washington's liberal and secular allies in the Iraqi elections. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The battle in the elections, the political game and the Iraqi security conflicts is played out between Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish movements, parties and groups with many contradiction between them but the overwhelming majority of them have religious overtones... </seg>
<seg id="22"> and do not distinguish between religion and politics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> * Continued security concerns and the series of suicide attacks against American and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan (thousands of Americans dead and wounded in 2005 alone) and against Israeli targets in occupied Palestine... </seg>
<seg id="24"> in spite of the pro-reform and democracy projects adopted by President Bush's administration over the years. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This means that these projects have not as yet helped to improve the image the general public and radical movements in the "Greater Middle East" have of Washington and its policies in the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Resolutions from the Georgia and Istanbul summits </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It may be premature to expect Washington to back down from its big project - also adopted by the Group of Eight at the Georgia summit and the Atlantic alliance summit in Istanbul in 2004 - which aims at re-enacting the Eastern European picture in the Arab Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, there are several indicators that reveal the hesitation of many American and European decision-makers in continuing to support the "democratic reform" project </seg>
<seg id="29"> if such a democracy leads to the appearance of forces opposed to the strategic interests of Washington and its allies in the region </seg>
<seg id="30"> and in the world, </seg>
<seg id="31"> starting with Israel's interests. </seg>
<seg id="32"> If this hesitation continues, the priority of Washington and its allies will again be security and military priorities and not political ones... </seg>
<seg id="33"> in spite of the public statements made repeatedly by President Bush Junior and his former Secretary of State Colin Powell and current Secretary of State Rice which deem one of the reasons for the appearance of anti-American and western terrorist movements to be its 60 year long support for the security option at the price of freedom and democracy. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunisia - Al-Sabah - Othman Bin Irfa, director-general of the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company, said that in the medium and long term, in other words over the next 20 years, our country needs to generate and produce electricity by investing in nuclear power which is regarded as the best cheap alternative energy solution </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> at present as the cost of fuel continues to rise in the world. </seg>
<seg id="4"> STEG's chief executive said on the occasion of his presentation of the company's strategy to guarantee the country's energy needs to the parliamentary Economic and Financial Committee, in the presence of representatives from the National Energy Control Agency yesterday evening at its headquarters in the capital, that there would soon be a high-level study of possible solutions to combat the problem of repeated outside attacks on the company's electricity and gas network causing annual losses of millions of dinars and representing the cause of 50% of electricity failures in Greater Tunis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Othman Bin Irfa, in this meeting attended by Izzedine Khalafallah, chief executive of the National Energy Agency, highlighted STEG's future programs in the field of energy production in addition to tackling many issues related to services offered to professionals. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In his speech on future possibilities in the area of alternative energy, he said that in addition to using solar and wind power, nuclear power is regarded as the most important alternative energy source that can be exploited to produce electricity, especially as the Tunisian electricity network has the capacity to contain and supply the massive electrical power produced by nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In this regard, he explained that Tunisia had presented an application for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency during a previous visit to our country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The presentation of the company's future programs revealed that in 2005 STEG produced 156600 oil equivalent tons, equivalent to 29 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The forthcoming phase will see work on supplying new areas with natural gas and connecting 50,000 new clients to the network as part of a program running from 2005 to 2009 to bring the number of clients to over 400,000 which will reduce state funding by around 92 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The company will also work in the future to reduce the provision of bottled gas by expanding the Qabis gas production and transfer plant to achieve an annual profit of about 15 million dinars, as well as improving quality and billing services using the latest technology and monthly debit payments which 70,000 clients have so far subscribed to or using pre-paid vouchers which may become more widely used in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> 1.25 oil equivalent tons saved </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The presentation by the chief executive of the National Energy Control Agency highlighted the essence of the three-part program to control energy in 2005-2009 which will result in total savings of around 1.25 million oil equivalent tons and reduce state funding by 220 million dinars for credits estimated at 70 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="13"> With regard to solar-powered hot water, 22,000m2 were processed and five suppliers and 237 companies were certified in 2005 which will lead to savings of about 1600 oil equivalent tons a year and reduce state funding by around 516 million dinars a year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> 84 natural gas companies were also contracted which will make it possible to replace around 100,000 oil equivalent tons a year of supported petroleum products and reduce state funding by around 7.6 million dinars a year. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 220,000 residents are also scheduled to be connected to the natural gas network and the use of energy-saving equipment will be made generally accessible by using around 8,000 pressure units in the old lighting networks, leading to an energy saving of 30% of the annual consumption cost of local councils, equivalent to 7 million dinars a year. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The energy control program will be extended to all domestic electrical appliances, starting with fridges where less energy efficient brands will be gradually be phased out, through category 8 then 7 then 6 and 5. </seg>
<seg id="17"> With regard to wind power, 160 megawatts will be processed by STEG by expanding the Sidi Daoud wind station as a first step. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In terms of scientific research, 8 research projects have been developed in the area of energy control involving 20 laboratories, 12 institutions and 200 researchers at various scientific research centers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Energy-saving lamp month </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The same program will process 3 million energy-saving lamps between 2005 and 2008 which will lead to an energy saving of 136,000 oil equivalent tons and reduce funding by 12 million dinars. To date, an international call for tenders has been put out for 2 million lamps with the possibility of supplying the market through local production of around 400,000 lamps a month at a cost of no more than 4500 millimes per lamp. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Concerning developments in terms of awareness and sensitization, energy-saving lamp month was launched from 10 to March 10th in the form of a multi-media advertising campaign to promote locally-made energy saving lamps sold at a fixed price of 2860 millimes to 4445 millimes, depending in the brand, in all major outlets. It is expected that the campaign will supply 400,000 lamps. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Television, radio, press and on the ground campaigns will continue to run this year alongside 6 sector seminars in cooperation with the ministries concerned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The meeting was punctuated by detailed discussions between committee members and STEG and National Energy Control Agency Officials. This was an opportunity for deputies to pose questions and make suggestions and many of them showed their surprise at what was presented by the two bodies in terms of important features of future programs in the area of energy control. </seg>
<seg id="24"> STEG's development on all levels has brought it national and international acclaim. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunisia - Al-Sabah - Preliminary forecasts for the food trade budget for the current year suggest that exports will grow by 15.6% to 1187 million dinars versus 1027 million dinars in 2005 according to the 2006 agriculture and fisheries trade budget to achieve an excess of 197 million dinars, making the volume of exports greater than that of imports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This improvement is based on an expected growth in olive oil exports which is predicted to be around 600 million dinars this year compared to 476 million dinars last year, an increase of 26%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As for other products, returns are expected to grow by 13% compared to last year for crab, with the French market making up most exports at a percentage of 99.8%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In this context, 241 tons of crab were exported for the first time last year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is in addition to positive growth expected in the dates sector (4.4%) given that date exports last year were close to 45,000 tons, worth 114 million dinars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Seafood exports are also expected to rise this year by 2.9% to 18,500 tons. It should be noted that 18,000 tons of seafood products worth 175 million dinars were exported in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> As for imports, the current year is stable at a total value of 990 million dinars, the same rate as 2005 at around 992 million dinars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Cereal imports are expected to grow by about 13% to 439 million dinars versus 338 million dinars last year. The reason for this is that production in this area fell to 1.8 million tons after reaching 1.2 million tons last year according to the economic budget while imports of other products will fall according to the same source. </seg>

<seg id="20"> Information indicates that they all had links with a Syrian person from Homs known as Jamil, an expert in electronic engineering, explosives and booby traps who provided fighters headed for Iraq with arms and money. The information also revealed that the two most dangerous members of this group were Khalid Taha and Bilal Zaroura who entered Lebanon from Syria last and who are thought to be in the Ain Al-Hilwa refugee camp. They have never been caught. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Interrogation of members of this group is interwoven with information about their involvement in the assassination of President Rafiq Hariri and the international investigation committee and the American side are asking to see this information which could be examined by a high-level judicial authority. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Members of this group are still being held by the information branch of the internal security forces and accompany them to the military investigating judge to continue the investigation into the crime of plotting terrorist acts. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, the way in which the case is being handled suggest that there is internal information related to the assassination but judicial sources do not confirm this information because they have no material proof at all and say that it is a case of political talk aimed at transferring the charge from one place to another. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Hizbollah who %pw declined to take part in Sunday's demonstration made use of the scenes of disarray and disorder to present a contradictory picture today of a packed crowd of hundreds of thousands. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition to this point concerning the arrangement and organization, Hezbollah's secretary Hassan Nasrallah made, on the basis of the Mar Mikhail meeting with General Aoun, a political attack on what he called those currently holding power, calling on them to face recent developments and accusing some of those who run the country of taking part in intensifying a political and sectarian atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nasrallah who is feeling a new sense of political ease revealed a program of priorities for the coming phase, at the top of which is an invitation to anyone who wishes to wage war on Syria or against Syria to make use of his party or faction or group but, according to Nasrallah, it is not possible to drag the government and state and its institutions into a war of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, hours after Hezbollah's political and popular presentation, Prime Minister Fuad Siniora continued to try to pick up the tail ends of last Sunday. He held a spiritual summit which he convened during at the Government House. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For more details, we are in direct contact with our colleague Donis Rahmi Fakhri. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Donis, good evening. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Good evening George. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Yes. At this time, the summit hasn't begun but, I mean, in a few minutes, it will start with the arrival of dignitaries or all the heads of the participating factions in this summit at the Governmental Palace. It will be presided over by the Prime Minister %pw sorry, Prime Minister Fuad Siniora. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So, ah, among %pw, ah, the heads of the participating factions are the Maronite patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutrous Sfair, the Mufti of the Lebanese Republic Sheikh Mohammed Rasheed Qabbani, Vice-President of the Supreme Shiite Muslin Council Sheikh Abdulmajid Qablan, Patriarch Gregorius the Third the patriarch of Antioch and most of Al-Mashraq, Al-Iskendaria and Orshlaim for Roman Catholics. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Patriarch Narcissus Pedros 19th, patriarch of the Catholic Armenians, and Doctor Salim Sihiouni, president of the Supreme Assembly of the Anglican faction in Syria and Lebanon, are also taking part. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Archbishop Elias Aouda, Archbishop Boulus Matar, Archbishop Kigham Khatsharian as well as Archbishop Roland Abu Jawda are also taking part. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As for the Druze faction, Qadhi Nihad Hariz, Archbishop Michel Qasarji, Archbishop Farsai Baz, Archbishop Maratanainos Ephram Barsoum, sorry, if you, I'm saying the name wrong, Archbishop Michel Qasarji, Archbishop Boulus Tahdah, Monsignor George Al-Masri, Archbishop Andre Haddad and Priest, ah, Bishawi, leader of the Jerusalem faction in Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So these are the names of the participants in this spiritual meeting or spiritual summit as George described it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As we know, there will be, during this summit, an important speech by Prime Minister Fuad Siniora whose contents he has refused to disclose before he reads it to the guests. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The meeting is followed, as we also know, by a dinner held by Prime Minister Siniora in honor of all the leaders of the factions taking part today in this meeting at the Governmental Palace. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The Mar Maroun Al-Jummaizi Church which was vandalised last Sunday today commemorated Saint Maroun's Day with an official celebratory Mass which brought together Lebanese dignitaries, headed by Presidents Emile Lahoud and Fuad Siniora and a representative of leader Nabih Berri. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Mar Maroun Day was celebrated again this year as Lebanon passes through difficult circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The celebration brought together at Mar Maroun Al-Jummaizi Church all of Lebanon's spiritual families. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The President of the Republic, General Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Fuad Siniora and a representative of the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Abdul Latif Al-Zane were present. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A large number of ministers, deputies and political, unionist, society, media and spiritual dignitaries, as well as the ambassadors of major foreign countries also took part in the holy celebration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The celebration was led by Archbishop Boulis Matar who said that the tradition of gathering to pray at the Mar Maroun Church in Beirut goes back three-quarters of a century and its continuation is simply a sign that the Lebanese, in spite of their differences, are bound together by love. </seg>
<seg id="7"> What is needed today is not name-calling or attacks, which are not constructive, but love. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The loss of security in our capital for a few hours and people's feelings of being without a roof over their heads to protect their possessions and all that they value sharply brought into focus the question of whether we justified things in the same way 30 years ago when we nearly lost everything, where we shed blood and tears in the hope that we and our future generations would see a bright tomorrow in a safe, stable and fully sovereign country and a competent and just state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So is it reasonable that any wait is too long for us after all that waiting? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Archbishop Matar stressed the need for constant dialogue through consultation with the people and a multiplicity of views in search of the best solutions in the eyes of the majority of citizens. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the majority does not bring people together according to their religious or other affiliations but on the basis of their views. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It progresses as power passes successively from one helmsman to another without any discomfiture on anyone's part. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The free hearts and minds game and free will increase in value as the group becomes increasingly enlightened in its rationality and more used to freedom. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is undoubtedly the healthiest basis for defining the good of the group because it involves everyone in searching and decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It also draws upon the majority to decide which majority is to take into consideration the view of the minority and their similarities rather than their differences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Prayers were offered for love to take root in Lebanon and for peace to reign throughout its lands. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In Kirki, the Maronite patriarch, Cardinal Sfair, emphasized the extent of the need for solidarity in these days of great pressure on Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Today we celebrate Saint Maroun's Day, the father of our Maronite Church, and the best way to celebrate saints is to emulate their lives. </seg>
<seg id="19"> A word from the Maronite patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Botros Sfair. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As he led the celebration at the church on the occasion of Saint Mar Maroun's Day, it was an occasion to mention the life of Saint Maroun which was characterized by giving, prayer, abstinence and fighting the temptations of the world and its vanities. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Cardinal Sfair called on the Lebanese to stand together in these days of great pressure. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We regret greatly what happened last Sunday in the capital Beirut in terms of the vandalism and destruction and violations which were intended to ignite the fire of sectarianism and we thank God that people's awareness allowed them to avoid this evil </seg>
<seg id="23"> We congratulate our Maronite brothers and sons on this, our Saint's day, here and in their homes near and far, and we invite them all to emulate the virtues of this saint, especially the qualities of fear of God, his freedom from temptation and his love for the people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> His thoughts say in the Lord's presence we are slaves of no use. Amen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> After the celebratory Mass, the believers and guests at Mar Maroun's Day went to the patriarchal palace where Cardinal Sfair received the French ambassador's representative Francois Abu Saad, former deputy Estafan Al-Douaie as well as a Lebanese Forces delegation from Ghadir. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The secretary of the Maronite cleric's college in Ghadir also spoke. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The situation is extremely difficult and what is intended for this country is now known and that there are those who do want peace for its sons. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But we also have to close ranks and realize that unity is strength and dispersal is weakness. </seg>

<seg id="2"> For its part, Washington showed caution with regard to this Russian move and reiterated its view that Hamas is a terrorist organization while France saw Putin's initiative as possibly strengthening the Quartet committee's role in spite of the initiative being taken without consultation with committee members. </seg>
<seg id="3"> International efforts to contain the Hamas movement after its victory in the Palestinian legislative elections was breached by Russia in a conspicuous move when, from Madrid, the Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to invite Hamas leaders to Moscow for talks on the future of the peace process between the Palestinians and Israelis. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Hamas has never been a terrorist organization in our view. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We have to acknowledge that Hamas came to power in the Palestinian Territories by way of democratic, legal elections. </seg>
<seg id="6"> We have to respect the Palestinian people's decision by finding solutions that all Palestinian sides agree on. </seg>
<seg id="7"> According to an official at the Russian Foreign Ministry, Moscow is to invite the Hamas movement to change its fundamentalist policies to include recognizing Israel. The Russian proposal was immediately welcomed by Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="8"> As we care about relations with, ah, all countries in the international and regional family, this pleases us, the Russian visit, and means talks and consultation with the government and Russian president. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Tel Aviv strongly rejected Putin's move and considered it to be effectively a stab in Israel's back. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Israeli Education Minister Meir Sheetrit regarded the aim of the initiative as giving international legitimacy to a terrorist group, as he put it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Russia must withdraw from any negotiations on peace in the Middle East and I suggest President Putin backs down from his decision to invite personalities from terrorist organizations involved in killing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Israeli position overlaps with Washington's position which showed reserve abut the Russian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="13"> They have to recognize Israel and renounce terrorism and abide by international agreements signed by the Palestinian Authority and as Russia is a member of the Quartet committee, we expect it to pass on the message. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For his part, the American Deputy Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs David Welsh pointed out that his country would review its aid to Palestinians if the Hamas movement forms a new government. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The head of the executive committee of the Lebanese Forces, Doctor Samir Geagea, stated that just as the Forces fought a war with ugliness so too would they fight for peace with ugliness. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Geagea, speaking before ((partisans)) to the Lebanese forces in the Aliyah area, announced that work would continue to find a consensual candidate to take over from the late deputy Edmond ((Eid)). </seg>
<seg id="3"> Doctor Samir Geagea confirmed that consultation and the search for a consensual candidate were continuing in order to prevent an election battle in Baabda Aley. </seg>
<seg id="4"> ((Speech)) by the head of the executive committee of the Lebanese Forces came during the meeting which brought together the Forces' command in the Aley area as part of a series of preparatory meetings to restructure the Lebanese Forces Party. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the present time we are making a very serious attempt to find a candidate to avoid an election battle even though it is a democratic battle, and to find a candidate acceptable to all sides. </seg>
<seg id="6"> ((Reached )) Is there a candidate who is acceptable to all the sides concerned, and of course we respect all the comrades concerned, especially the Free Nationalist movement. A consensual candidate means we have to sit in a closed room and discuss all the names put forward and those that haven't been put forward. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Put forward and not put forward, so we reach, we'll contact everyone we represent to find a name that's acceptable to both sides. </seg>
<seg id="8"> As far as we are concerned, this is how there is consensus, we sit down and put forward one two three fifteen names, ((it can get up to)) fifteen, until we arrive at a name among them which we are happy with and the rest of the sides involved in the battle are happy with. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This is what we're testing out at the moment, putting all our weight behind it, concentrating on it fully and we're trying to achieve it. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I quite simply and honestly wanted to put you in the picture but at the same time, I have to say again that this doesn't mean they didn't prepare for the parliamentary elections and make the efforts that led to the required result. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Doctor Geagea also raised two important issues being discussed in the political arena today, the issue of the economic situation and the need for an effective solution to be implemented. The second issue is the policy of patience and restraint which the Lebanese Forces are calling for following recent events. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Today we fight the battle with courage and just as we fought the war with courage, we want to fight for peace with courage and peace takes a lot more courage than war. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It's not a phase in the sense of a phase as we know it, when restraint and calmness take much more courage than putting your hand on the trigger and firing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> ((A place to take over )) but not a place for ((complete)) restraint. How could we leave the economic and social situation and work on politics. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The answer is that there can't be any serious economic solutions or any serious social solutions outside of establishing an active, competent state. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You can bring all the experts in the world and they can give you all the solutions you can imagine but they need someone to implement them, who wants to implement them, an active state to implement them, this active state that we don't yet have. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I'd like to point out that head of the executive committee of the Lebanese Forces met with British ambassador James Watt for one hour and the British ambassador didn't make any statement. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Ah, I apologize, before we continue this news bulletin, for the mistake at the beginning of the report about Doctor Samir Geagea's position who stated that just as the Forces fought a war with courage so too would they fight for peace with courage.

<seg id="2"> The head of the executive committee of the Lebanese Forces, Doctor Samir Geagea, spoke on the program Naharkum Saiid of what he called the rescue plan to liberate the presidency of the republic. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A multifaceted plan because ((I don't see in it))a situation in the country that remains, ah, in the state of fluctuation it's in now. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Of course the presidency is a pivotal position contrary ((to what many believe)), so from this departure point, if we hope for any improvement in the situation in the country, we must start from this point. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The fundamentals of this plan are of course still being studied but its basic factors will be constitutional, legal, political and populist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Okay, what is the time span, I mean, is there a defined time span for this story? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not a lot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Not a lot, of course, ah, any movement on this kind of plan, of this kind, I mean, there's no-one who can estimate when it will end but we can estimate when it will start. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Okay, General Michel Aoun considered yesterday that extending President Lahoud's term was restrictive just as the election law was restrictive. Do you agree with this comparison? </seg>
<seg id="13"> No, and this, I mean, this comparison is not, is not accurate and not scientific. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Extending President Lahoud's term was restrictive in that a group from the intelligence service came and ((found the deputies)) and threatened them and said to them you have to agree to the extension law, whereas the 2000 election law put forward by the Chamber of Deputies had a second law in it which was the Sixty law after which there was a political settlement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I repeat it's not that the intelligence service came and found the deputies and said to them that you must work according to the 2000 law. No, a political settlement came from a ((need)) on all sides to conduct the elections on time ((otherwise the country would be in a constitutional vacuum)). </seg>
<seg id="16"> And on the basis of, ah, Berri using his position to pass the 2000 law because ((how)) a law suited him more, it suited him, the parties had to reach a political settlement and of course a political settlement is one thing, and restrictive extension in terms of %pw, because it is subjugation and coercion is something else altogether. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So the 2000 law, which of course we don't agree to, came from a political settlement at the time, came from a point of departure based on the situation that was prevalent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Deputy Botross Harb saw Decree 1559 as putting the president of the republic in an illegal situation and was surprised by General Michel Aoun's invitation to hold early parliamentary elections. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Deputy Botross Harb said the message he sent (()) to the president of the republic General Emile Lahoud on his birthday was interpreted by President Lahud as though it were support for him and when he didn't take the initiative to step down, the March 14 Forces had to open the presidential dossier seriously. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Ah, of course we would like the president of the republic to be aware of the situation and its danger and the extremely negative repercussions for Lebanon if he  remains in the situation he is in and which will be very, very damaging to the presidency, apart from the personal damage, I mean, to the president because any discussion we see on television has, to tell the truth, words that are damaging and offensive, and also the position of the president has become absent from, absent, I mean, there is nothing in political life except for statements which come out in response to so and so and this of course damages the presidency, ah, even more, and negative positions on laws that come out of the Chamber of Deputies, regardless of whether there is a right to reply or not. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Harb pointed out many ways of remedying the matter of the presidency and there are the two aspects, constitutional and legal, and there is political and popular work. </seg>
<seg id="22"> ((Sheikh)) Some of us are aware of the constitution and legal mechanics which you approve of. Will you approve what was mentioned in 1559 on the basis of the reports by ((Larsen)) and ((Milice)), are you going to approve, I mean, removing the president of the republic from power? </seg>
<seg id="23"> 1556 stipulated the need for free presidential elections which comply with the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="24"> What happened on the second day of the elections was that a different decision came out which completely contradicted one of the provisions of this decision and this means that, internationally, the president's presence contravenes 1556 and contradicts international trends and international legitimacy and this is of course  a huge opening in which there could be a way that leads to the president of the republic being in an illegal situation in terms of the international community and in the end, he will be dealt with on this basis. This hasn't happened yet and to be honest, we were taking care to make sure it doesn't happen because we thought that and so we wanted the president of the republic to take the initiative because the reality he is living is not to be envied, I mean. </seg>
<seg id="25"> ((Sheikh)) but General Aoun, I mean, who was against an extension and opposed the president of the republic is now opposing the removal of the president from power and calling for presidential elections to be replaced by early parliamentary elections, I mean, what is your response to this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> The, the goal of the elections, what? </seg>
<seg id="27"> That we return the </seg>
<seg id="28"> I mean, there may be a result that is different from the current political structure %pw so and so has more and so and so has less, this is not what is needed. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What is needed is for us to make use of this state of international support ((for Lebanon)) and the ensuing national situation which resulted yesterday on February 14 and this, this national marriage happening for the first time in Lebanon's history, for ((those born)) in Lebanon, for those born in a ((Lebanon)) that is free, united, sovereign, independent, I mean, Lebanon's history is seeing something new which it would be a sin to miss (()). </seg>
<seg id="30"> The men have not broken off from the country. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Not one of us can claim that he is the only right person and that everyone else is not right. </seg>
<seg id="32"> There are a lot of good people in Lebanon and there are people who agree who we can reach an understanding with. </seg>
<seg id="33"> We care about Lebanon's interests, and any person who understands that we have to ensure Lebanon's interest knows we all have to let go of our personal demands and we have to let go of our trends and, to the contrary, make efforts to agree on a person to carry our joint project to build a modern state and establish sovereignty and independence and bring back the state's power to Lebanon, this is the project we have to carry, not that of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Harb considered that in the matter of the presidency, it is not the individual that is important but the project and the individual's background and aspirations and ability to deal positively with all forces. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman of the People's Bank of China (central bank) said recently that the rise in the level of citizen savings deposits was linked to many factors such as traditional culture, social structure and the concept of family in China but that the incompleteness of the social security system was an important reason for people's lack of courage in spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Zhou said that the incompleteness of the social security system was a temporary phenomenon and that the government must be quick to reform the pensions, medical insurance and education systems in order to reduce "preventive saving" by many citizens until the level of savings deposits and the gross national product fall to normal levels. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Riyadh February 13 /Xinhua/ The secretary-general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference Professor Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Policy and Security Javier Solana held talks today at the organization's secretariat's headquarters in Jeddah on the ramifications of the publication by a Danish newspaper of offensive cartoons of the prophet in order to arrive at a satisfactory solution to the matter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The organization's secretary-general, Ihsanoglu, started by welcoming his European guest and expressed his appreciation of his visit to the organization's headquarters in light of the current situation in which feelings of indignation and anger have intensified throughout the Muslim world in reaction to attempts by some western newspapers to insult sacred Islamic values under the pretext of freedom of expression, according to Saudi news agency reports this evening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The secretary-general said during the discussions that he hoped for European Union cooperation in overcoming this crisis and ensuring it was not repeated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> For his part Solana stated that his visit to the headquarters of the Organization of the Islamic Conference for the first time was to send out a signal to Islamic public opinion to express Europe's strong respect for Islam and for Muslim feelings and to show sadness and regret at the consequences of the cartoons' issue where the publishers misjudged Muslim feelings about them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Solana said that " this whole issue had no justification and we understand the reactions of Muslims who felt it was unjust and wrong", stressing his sincere desire to cooperate with the Organization of the Islamic Conference and with Muslim countries to avoid a recurrence of the incident in the future. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He added that "today's world is full of complex crises and the last thing we want is a confrontation because of these cartoons. We must work and cooperate in order to create a safe world and talk together to put into place measures that will calm the situation first and then consider conditions that will ensure that this incident is not repeated." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Solana mentioned the spirit of cooperation he was shown and Ihsanoglu made a number of legal and political proposals which could prevent a recurrence of this crisis. These proposals include European Union approval of legal measures against Islamophobia in Europe through the European Parliament, joint European-Muslim efforts for the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations general assembly along the lines of the recently issued Resolution 60/15 on "Combating defamation of religions" which would prohibit the defamation of all prophets and faiths, adopting a code of conduct for the Western media which takes into account Muslim sensitivities and prohibits defamation in any form or manner of the prophets and central beliefs of religions, including ridiculing prophets, with this to be regarded as a moral offence in the western media code, and the United Nations adopting an international media order which includes a definition of the limits of freedom of speech with regard to religious symbols within the framework of UNESCO and the inclusion of a paragraph in the constitution of the new Human Rights Council prohibiting blasphemy. Solana welcomed these ideas and promised to cooperate with the secretary-general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the European Union and the United Nations in order to implement them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He also expressed his desire for a joint meeting between the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the European Union as a continuation of the meeting which brought together the two organizations in 2002 in Istanbul and gave rise to positive results in facilitating understanding and dialogue between the Muslim world and the West. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Cairo February 15 /Xinhua/ An Egyptian parliamentary source said today, Wednesday, that the Egyptian People's Assembly approved a draft bill yesterday evening, Tuesday, presented by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to postpone local council elections for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The same source, a member of the ruling National Party, told Xinhua in Cairo that the People's Assembly in a session yesterday evening, Tuesday, approved the postponement of a draft bill to extend current local council terms by two years, which means postponing elections that were to be held in the next two months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The source said that the Council saw many heated debates between Muslim Brotherhood deputies, official opposition parties and a number of independents who object to the draft bill, on the one hand, and the ruling National Party deputies, on the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He said that he regarded the proposal that local councils should continue their term for another two years until elections are held, in accordance with a new vision for the management of local administration provided for under the terms of a new law, as being in keeping with the requirements of the constitutional reform aimed at by President Hosni Mubarak's program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He said that holding elections now and in accordance with current legislation for local administration would mean that the councils created by such elections would not be in line with what the new local administration law has introduced with regard to a vision and direction that supports local administration and consolidates their executive and supervisory powers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The source said the two year postponement decision was in keeping with an important practical consideration because postponing the elections for just one year would make the local council elections coincide with the Shura Council's mid-term elections which begin in April 2007, a situation which practical considerations prohibit and that in view of the above, the text for the draft bill provides for existing local councils to continue their term for another two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Egyptian Shura Council approved the postponement of the local elections two days ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It should be noted that the term in office of current local councils ends next April 15 and local council elections are, according to law, to be held within a period of 60 days prior to the end of their terms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Opposition parties and political forces in Egypt have rejected the Shura Council's decision to back the bill to postpone the elections and accuse the ruling National Democratic Party of trying to stop them fighting the elections and marginalizing their role in the local arena. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The statement said that the letters stressed that "continued operations and attacks mean the peace option will fail and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state along the June 4 1967 borders, and that they fall within a policy of imposing and dictating on the ground rather than through negotiation." </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Why do we Muslims rant about human rights for Muslim minorities in the West yet refuse to apply these to Christians in countries in which we are the majority? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; By Doctor Yusra Mustapha, a Muslim writer but against terrorism </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> For our Muslim governments, who take the religion of Islam as the basis for their legislation, not to like human rights, especially the rights of religious minorities to practice their rituals, this is understandable. But for human rights to be regarded with suspicion by the upper classes and working classes outside the governmental sphere, this is a matter that requires reflection and an explanation. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We have seen, over the past years, that one of the major challenges for human rights and women's rights groups is assimilating human rights into a culture that still does not want to recognize the principles of human rights and their universality. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As we know, the principal pillar on which the rejection of human rights is based is cultural specificity, that discourse which argues that our societies have different values in terms of human rights values because the latter are western values in origin and nature. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In any case, the problem of spreading human rights culture does not result from restrictions by the state alone. Alongside this is a general ethos fed by the discourse of cultural specificity aimed at stripping universal human rights' values of their legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In truth, this cultural rejection, which non-governmental political and ideological forces contribute to keeping alive, is a fact that cannot be ignored. Rather than ignoring it, it would be better look for the causes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I think that the principles of human rights find no resonance in our societies not because they are foreign to us, but perhaps because they are foreign to a legal and political order with a selective approach to human rights and double standards. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Anyone interested in the matter will not be unaware that human rights are not rejected as a whole but in parts. Group rights for example are acceptable, as are political rights, even if they bother the government but they are listened to by opposition forces, including those that promote the discourse of cultural specificity. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As for personal rights, these are the real problem; they are what give rise to the discourse of cultural specificity, not just by governments but also by political and ideological forces that stand shoulder to shoulder with the authorities to create a public opinion that is opposed to universal human rights in the name of specificity. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When we talk about the right to develop, we feel a group comfort and accuse the western Other of exploiting us and when we talk about the right to form parties, the opposition responds and the government is angered. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But when it comes to freedom of thought or belief or personal rights for women, the discourse of cultural specificity comes to the fore to strip human rights of their legitimacy by seeing them as Western values. Consequently, the issue of cultural specificity is not used to confront human rights in a general manner but in a partial, selective manner, especially when the matter concerns fundamentally personal rights and freedom. </seg>
<seg id="13"> From this point, if we want to examine the lack of cultural legitimacy we accord the principles of human rights in our societies, we have to start from our cultural and political position on personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In other words, we have to start at the beginning by first questioning how legitimate personal rights are before we start talking about the legitimacy of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A respected article by the German philosopher Habermas entitled "Ascribing legitimacy by means of human rights" in which he says, "New laws fundamentally come about from the starting point of personal rights". </seg>
<seg id="16"> These rights give a law-abiding person legal scope to act according to his personal priorities. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In this way, these rights absolve the person who holds the rights, in a very modified manner, from any other kind of ethical-moral orders or recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In any case, no-one is legally required, within the limits allowed by law, to openly show his work. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Habermas points out that personal freedoms have been brought into the framework of modern law and as such, this is different from traditional legal systems. This reinforces Hobbes' principle which states: Everything is allowed that is not expressly prohibited and this is how law differs from morality. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The separation of law from morality in modern law is an important issue, not because we like the law and hate morality but because this is the modern historical logic for the principle of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This separation is what has historically allowed the existence of essentially legal entities on the basis of the concept of personal rights, as opposed to conventional orders in which people are essentially moral beings that are formed and disciplined in accordance with moral systems based on religion or customs and conventions or even modern political ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="22"> While contemporary law is founded on the principle of personal rights, moral discourse is based on a collective, comprehensive concept of rights and duties. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In  truth, when the matter concerns the individual in our societies, we find ourselves living in three dimensions: in one aspect, we are lawful entities as a result of historical progress which we do not reject, because laws rule us even if such laws conflict with general and personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A second aspect is that sections of civil law are interwoven with the religious-moral-terrorist as a model for laws relating to civil status or freedom of thought or belief or the religious rights of minorities. </seg>
<seg id="25"> A third aspect is that we as people are largely subject in our lives to purely moral rules which have an authority that the law does not have, especially when the matter relates to personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Yet with even this degree of freedom unfettered by the law, morality appears and curbs it, unlike law. </seg>
<seg id="27"> This is similar to the collective religious discourse, or what is endorsed in the name of customs and traditions, which comes in to impose new patterns of life within a framework of a system of rules and non-judicial moral restrictions by means of which individuals organize their lives in their capacity as moral beings. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some might think that certain legal tenets are in constant conflict with moral tenets but this is far from being correct. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Law and morality can meet in a positive manner when both law and morals criminalize crimes, killing and theft for example. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But they also meet in a negative way to restrict personal freedoms and rights. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In our societies in particular, law regresses into its oppressive forms and leaves the arena to moral laws, not because they rival it but because these laws play a utilitarian role in the interest of authority, in other words the role of social control, especially in the area of personal rights and freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In this controlling context, an alliance occurs between three authorities: political authority, religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> What cannot be controlled by law can be controlled by morality and an individual will be punished, even if he has not broken the law. </seg>
<seg id="34"> What is noticeable is that this process of control is dependent on moral punishment, which can progress to violence, where individuals are categorized not on the basis of abiding or not abiding by the law but on the basis of a moral trait in the manner of what is pure and impure in the primitive sense. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The religious discourse addressed to women depends of a kind of moral grading such as saying the Hijab equals chastity and purity and she who does not wear the Hijab is punished culturally and socially in the sense that she has lost her legitimacy in terms of chastity and purity. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We also see this kind of grading in political ideologies where he hear the term "honorable citizens", suggesting that the person who does not follow the political agenda is only a citizen and if he objects, he may be deemed to be a dishonorable citizen. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The language of chastity and purity and honor involve a type of non-judicial punishment of moral entities. </seg>
<seg id="38"> This highlights the dilemma of the legitimacy of human rights because the language of human rights is a legal language in principle, in other words it is designed to speak to lawful entities that live within a political and legal order based on citizenship which recognizes the personal rights of individuals and protects them. </seg>
<seg id="39"> However, the problem, as pointed out earlier, is that the lawful entity itself has no cultural legitimacy and is replaced by an entity that is moral in essence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> On the basis of this, the discourse of human rights enters into an area that is foreign to its legal language and terms and is treated in a selective manner where the collective is accepted and the personal is rejected. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The legitimacy of human rights cannot be instituted until there is collective recognition that they are legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="42"> This recognition will not come as long as there are authorities that fear human rights and people who do not speak the language of law, which is the language of human rights, but rather with the language of morality which is the language of political and religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="43"> This is where the importance of defending the issue of citizenship comes in, not because it is a matter of tolerance and co-existence but because it is fundamentally a matter of civil rights and giving consideration to the lawful entity based on personal rights and freedom. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Sent: 8/Feb/2006 10:58 AM </seg>
<seg id="5"> And cows... make mistakes!! </seg>
<seg id="6"> Badriya Al-Abd Al-Rahman 2/1/1427  2/1/2006 </seg>
<seg id="7"> I know that my topic is the hottest topic on the Islamic scene these days... </seg>
<seg id="8"> It might seem to a lot of you that it is repetitive of me to talk about the Danish foolishness that has rallied Muslim feelings across the world... and how we were able to read and calm a situation that presaged undesirable results. </seg>
<seg id="9"> What's the story? </seg>
<seg id="10"> How can we explain this highly exceptional behavior? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Can we interpret it as a sudden awakening of religious fanaticism in the century of tolerance and non-bigotry?!! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Or is it a more abrupt awakening of non-religious fanaticism against religion and faiths and religious icons?! </seg>
<seg id="13"> What is most surprising is that this is happening in a quiet, peaceful country that has noticeably abstained from participating in international decisions... yet it is perhaps this political activity (and "untouchableness") and geographical distance from the sites of cultural and ideological conflict, especially with Muslims and with other civilizations in general, that make it a controversial issue, </seg>
<seg id="14"> that there should be an initiative (although exceptional) by a magazine to provoke the followers of the Muslim religion that millions worldwide believe in. </seg>
<seg id="15"> What is worse is that this provocation should take place not out of goodwill or in order to bring about a dialog with the other... but to create an Islam (with medals)on which accusations and previously defined stereotypical images of our religion are hung... </seg>
<seg id="16"> This whole scene showed extremely shocking Danish foolishness which I don't think history will gloss over easily... and I don't think the land of cows and milk with its image of great kindness and naivety needed to flex its muscles - when it wanted to flex them - by provoking Islamists and Muslims of all persuasions... </seg>
<seg id="17"> Why only Islam...? </seg>
<seg id="18"> and using the supreme symbol of this religion, its Noble Prophet May God's Peace Be Upon Him... describing it as the religion of bombs and death... categorically...  more categorically than categorically... because the role of the cartoons in the newspaper is to implant the image of a true Muslim reality that only idiots argue about...! </seg>
<seg id="19"> So it is with this simplicity that the long history of a major religion is reduced to a cartoon depiction that is offensive to us alone, and not to other religions and ideological movements in the world in whose name atrocities and crimes against the whole world were committed... so that Islam alone remains on the death list... </seg>
<seg id="20"> This is how what is sacrosanct is debased and religious sensibilities are attacked beyond the red line, and cross it by hundreds of meters without the slightest shame or logic... as though religion is now a product or merchandise of no importance in terms of what it symbolizes and does, and what it brings about in the souls of its believers.... </seg>
<seg id="21"> In brief, a lack of manners and rudeness in the cultural code ... in the political code... in all codes... nothing can explain this foolishness except that it is a lack of manners which Denmark did not expect to result in any foolish action against it... because it was quite simply being (impious and oppressive). </seg>
<seg id="22"> Damn this miserable image... not only because it is wrong and ugly... but because it also awakens issues that have been fomenting for centuries in the Western mind against Islamists... Islamists of death and the sword and horses and slitting throats in God's name... no more </seg>
<seg id="23"> Residues that have found those who stir them up to muddy the relative harmony in which Muslims in the West live, and in Denmark in particular specifically because of fanatics (of whatever ideological type) who are not aware of the dangers of what they are doing... </seg>
<seg id="24"> What has Denmark done to itself for God's sake?! </seg>
<seg id="25"> And how can it hope to gain our respect after all that has happened? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can it protect its citizens in Islamic countries, and everywhere, from the fierce anger of Muslims?! </seg>
<seg id="27"> Just questions, I don't know if they have gone through or are going through the minds of the Danes and public opinion and decision-makers... or is that mind still preoccupied with milking its cows and making its butter without being conscious of the enormity of the crisis it has been landed in by a magazine team that has now become every Dane in the mind of every Muslim! </seg>
<seg id="28"> We boycott... so that we can be...! </seg>
<seg id="29"> Calls via text messages and email to boycott Danish products and defame them are a healthy and good manifestation and I fully support this... </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the boycott on American and Israeli goods, the Muslim Arab mind has leapt to create its "say no" areas which are heavy and difficult at times... yet in a beautiful and admirable way, even though we might disagree with it. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The international mind must understand that the Muslim is no longer one of a group of countries mainly from the Third World (when you are absent and they cannot be ordered because they are witnesses)... it is now educated, someone aware of his or her cultural background which is the Muslim religion with its different sects or varied commitment to its religious teachings... </seg>
<seg id="32"> What is important is that it now knows how to say "No" in a loud and cultured voice, in a manner that expresses its unease with the arrogance of the abuse which the Westerners use against the Arabs who need them and resort to them and line up in queues to get entry visas and work there... </seg>
<seg id="33"> Western arrogance which has a long history and has lasted and has finally come to debase what is sacrosanct... and what is sacrosanct is a huge red line in any culture which every person has the right to protest against if it is debased through sarcasm and humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When I say this, I know that my boycotting and your boycotting will not damage or diminish Danish butter or its widespread reputation... nor its stupid cows... but we do it for ourselves... so that we don't lose the only simple "no" we have at the moment which fills our mouths... </seg>
<seg id="35"> Let us say: "We are here, we live on this planet with all our problems and crises... we can live side by side and we deserve respect... ... we possess the right to express ourselves and to reject, even though we hate having to do this..." </seg>
<seg id="36"> To stop more trouble-making and hatred being pumped into the sea of hatred that our pitiful planet is rolling in... I hope that Denmark will make a sweeping and deep-felt apology to Muslim sensibilities and alleviate the extent of the crisis... </seg>
<seg id="37"> and not wait for what is in the Muslim heart to be expunged in one go with one apology... because the extent of the shock was great and eliminating it will be no easy matter... </seg>
<seg id="38"> Because if that apology is not made, then we will spend our whole lives replaying this piece... regurgitating hatred... and raising our children and our children will raise their children to believe that Denmark and Satan are brothers and what applies to one applies to the other... </seg>
<seg id="39"> If this apology is not made then the fire of hatred will carry on burning... and perhaps Denmark will be surprised by a deed that results because the feelings of Muslims were provoked. It may find a good application of the hardened terrorist with his (explosive) turban in its land and amongst its beautiful castles and its ugly cows. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Perhaps Denmark will lose all its beauty and naivety because of its long tongue... </seg>
<seg id="41"> Perhaps its cows have chattered away more stupidly than usual... </seg>
<seg id="42"> Perhaps we have only a few days before we see something we would not have wished upon Denmark before ... </seg>
<seg id="43"> Perhaps everything will happen (here or there) </seg>
<seg id="44"> How I hate (perhaps) in this context... May God prevent any evil, perhaps...!!! </seg>

<seg id="1"> Negative and positive self-programming </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt;  Bandar Al-Shalaan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3">________________________________  </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sent: 11/Feb/2006 2:42 PM </seg>
<seg id="5"> Negative and positive self-programming... </seg>
<seg id="6"> Most people are programmed from a young age to behave, speak or think in a specific negative way. This grows with them until they become prisoners of what is called "negative programming" which stops them achieving many things in this life. </seg>
<seg id="7"> We find many of them saying "I have a weak personality. I can't stop smoking. I'm bad at dictations. I..." </seg>
<seg id="8"> We find they have acquired this negativity from the family, school or friends or all of these together. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But can this negative programming be changed and transformed into positive programming? The answer is yes... a thousand times yes. But why is this necessary??? </seg>
<seg id="10"> We need to program ourselves positively to be happy and successful, to live a good life, to realize our dreams and goals. Especially as we are Muslims and we have a task and an aim that we must achieve in order to worship God Almighty and realize the vicegerency that God has given us on this earth. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Before we start the program to change negative programming, we must agree on a number of matters which are: </seg>
<seg id="12"> You have to decide deep inside yourself that you want to change. Your decision is what will light the way to transforming negativity into positivity. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Repeat the actions and affirmations you are about to learn and make them part of your life. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now, the first method in positive programming is: </seg>
<seg id="15"> Talking to yourself: </seg>
<seg id="16"> Have you seen someone talking to themselves loudly as they walk along, gesticulating and murmuring and maybe swearing and cursing. Of course we don't want you to copy this behavior. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Or have you ever had a fierce argument with another person and, after the person leaves, the argument goes round in your mind again so that you imagine the argument again and start changing the words and expressions around and saying to yourself why didn't I say this or that... </seg>
<seg id="18"> Did you ever attend a lecture or talk and talked to yourself and said "I couldn't make a speech like that" or "how could I stand up in front of all those people" or you say "I could never stand up in front of people to give a speech or a lecture." </seg>
<seg id="19"> All this talk and discussion with the self negatively programs a person and could lead to unhealthy actions. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Luckily you and I and anyone have the ability to change our attitude to how we talk to ourselves and we can change negative programming and replace it with a new programming that gives us power. </seg>
<seg id="21"> One self-help guru says, "We can change our past and our future at every moment by reprogramming our present." </seg>
<seg id="22"> So, from now on, we have to watch and be aware of the internal dialogue we have with ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It has been said, </seg>
<seg id="24"> Watch your thoughts because they will become actions. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Watch your actions because they will become habits. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Watch your habits because they will become traits... </seg>
<seg id="27"> Watch your traits because they will decide you fate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I want clarify a few scientific facts about the human mind, and to focus in particular on the subconscious mind. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The subconscious mind does not rationalize things in the same way as the conscious mind because it quite simply stores information and repeats it whenever it is called up from where it is stored. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If a message is programmed in the mind for a long time and repeated constantly, for example if you always say in every situation... "I'm very shy, I'm very shy", "I'm bad-tempered" or "I can't play sports", "I can't stop smoking" and so on, then such messages become embedded and stay deep within the subconscious mind and can't be changed. But they can be replaced by other healthy and positive programming. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Another fact is that the subconscious mind has strange behavior we're don't notice. So for example if I say this sentence to you, "Do not think of a black horse", can you do that and stop your mind from thinking about it. Of course not, because you have most likely started to think of a black horse. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Why?? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Your mind has cancelled out the word "not" and retained the rest of the sentence which is: Think of a black horse. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So is it possible to exploit this strange behavior of the mind? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Let's now give you a summary and let Doctor  Ibrahim Al-Faqi tell us, as he mentions in his book The Power of Self-Control: Rules and Basic Program for Positive Self-Programming: </seg>
<seg id="36"> He says: </seg>
<seg id="37"> Here are the five rules for programming the subconscious: </seg>
<seg id="38"> - Your message must be clear and definite. </seg>
<seg id="39"> - Your message must be positive (such as I am strong, I am healthy, I can stop...) </seg>
<seg id="40"> - Your message must be in the present tense (for example, don't say "I will be stronger" but say "I am strong") </seg>
<seg id="41"> - Your message must be accompanied by a strong belief in its content so that the subconscious mind accepts it and programs it </seg>
<seg id="42"> - The message must be repeated several times to be completely programmed. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Here's the plan so that your dialogue with yourself has positive power: </seg>
<seg id="44"> Write at least five self-messages with a negative effect on you such as: </seg>
<seg id="45"> I'm shy, I can't stop smoking, my memory is poor, I can't speak in public, I'm bad-tempered, then tear up the paper you wrote the negative messages on and throw it away. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Write five positive self-messages which give you strength and always start with the word "I" such as: </seg>
<seg id="47"> "I can stop smoking", "I like talking to people", "I have a good memory" </seg>
<seg id="48"> "I am an excellent person", "I am active and have a lot of energy". </seg>
<seg id="49"> Write your positive message in a small diary and keep it with you at all times. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Now take a deep breath and read the messages one after the other till you memorize them. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Start again with the first message and take a deep breath, get rid of any tension in your body, read the first message 10 times with emotion, close your eyes and imagine yourself in your new form then open your eyes. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Starting from today, be careful about what you say to yourself and be careful what you say to others and be careful about what others say to you. If you notice any negative message, cancel it out by saying "cancel" and replace it with a different, positive message. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Make sure you have strength and can be and can possess and can do whatever you want simply by defining exactly what it is you want and moving in that direction with all your strength. Jim Ron talked about this in his book "Permanent Happiness": "Repetition is the basis of skills" </seg>
<seg id="54"> This is why you must have confidence in what you say and also repear positive messages to yourself for you are the master of your mind and the captain of your ship... you control your life and you can transform your life into a limitless happy, healthy and successful experience. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Always remember: </seg>
<seg id="56"> Live each moment as though it is the last moment in your life. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Live in faith, live in hope. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Live in love, live in challenge. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Value how precious your life is. </seg>
<seg id="60"> (adapted from the book The Power of Self-Control by Dr Ibrahim Al-Faqi) </seg>
<seg id="61"> Finally, I wish you luck, forgiveness and mercy. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Amen </seg>

<seg id="5"> Dandruff... causes and treatment </seg>
<seg id="6"> I believe this is a very common problem which everyone suffers from at one point or another in their life </seg>
<seg id="7"> At one time, it was believed that dandruff was caused by the rapid growth of hair cells on the scalp but this idea has been found to be wrong. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It has recently been discovered that dandruff is caused by a type of yeast called Pityrosporum Ovale </seg>
<seg id="9"> and the problem appears as a result of poor circulation in the scalp, </seg>
<seg id="10"> anxiety </seg>
<seg id="11"> using hot water to wash hair </seg>
<seg id="12"> as well as greasy hair having some role to play in this. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Sometimes dandruff does not cause much of a problem but when it appears on clothes or itches or leaves an unpleasant smell in the hair, the problem starts. </seg>
<seg id="14"> One's chic appearance and dignity are blown away and dandruff becomes a question that needs an answer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The question is, how do we treat it? </seg>
<seg id="16"> There is general advice we have to pay attention which is: </seg>
<seg id="17"> 1. not to use other people's implements to comb one's hair, </seg>
<seg id="18"> 2. paying attention to the cleanliness of our personal implements... which means washing brushes and combs at least once a week, </seg>
<seg id="19"> 3. washing hair with specific treatment shampoos available in the shops. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Here I would advise you to use Nezoral shampoo, not because I'm advertising it or anything but because this shampoo contains the substance Ketoconazole and this substance is effective in getting rid of the yeasts which cause dandruff. </seg>
<seg id="21"> After using the shampoo, rinse your hair with vinegar diluted in water and massage the scalp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Here are some effective measures: </seg>
<seg id="23"> * Wash you hair. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Rub your hair with apple vinegar. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Leave it on for a quarter of an hour. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Rinse it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> * Wash you hair. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Mix 1/2 cup of apple vinegar with 1/2 cup of lemon juice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Massage your scalp with the mixture. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Leave the mixture on your head for half an hour. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Apply olive oil and leave for another quarter of an hour then wash your hair with shampoo. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Repeat this process once a week until the dandruff disappears. You may not need to do it more than once. </seg>
<seg id="33"> * Olive oil, almond oil and cactus oil help the scalp regain its balance and feed it. </seg>
<seg id="34"> My regards and stay well. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Pains in the Red Sea </seg>
<seg id="6"> My father put a life jacket on me when he saw the Al-Ibara tilt and start to sink, </seg>
<seg id="7"> After that, I saw my father drown then my mother, </seg>
<seg id="8"> I remained alone for 30 hours battling the waves, helped by one of the survivors, until the rescue teams came and lifted me out of the water. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everything is lost, </seg>
<seg id="10"> I was living in Saudi Arabia for three years where I had tasted the bitterness of life, </seg>
<seg id="11"> I came back with the "fruits of my life", to marry and settle down, </seg>
<seg id="12"> But suddenly, everything was lost... everything. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was a fire in the lower decks of Al-Ibara, </seg>
<seg id="14"> but the crew prevented some passengers who saw the fire from putting on life jackets under the pretext that it would cause unnecessary panic among other passengers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You saw the result, </seg>
<seg id="16"> Al-Ibara went down and with it more than 1000 passengers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Al-Ibara's crew told us when we saw smoke coming out of the engine room on the lower deck "don't worry, we'll put it out". </seg>
<seg id="18"> When things got much worse, we couldn't find the lifeboats because some workers on board the Al-Ibara took them and left us on the ship to face death alone. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I was in the water for 30 hours, battling death, </seg>
<seg id="20"> 30 hours without food or water, </seg>
<seg id="21"> My skin nearly melted. </seg>
<seg id="22"> So where is respect for our humanity? </seg>
<seg id="23"> If Al-Ibara's passengers had been Israeli, would they have been treated with such negligence and such slowness? </seg>
<seg id="24"> God gave me the gift of three children, two girls and one boy, and we lived in Saudi Arabia together, </seg>
<seg id="25"> then we decided to return home for good and settle in Egypt, </seg>
<seg id="26"> so I sent on my furniture and my children's books and all our possessions. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Shortly after sailing off, we were overcome with terror as we saw smoke rise from the ship, </seg>
<seg id="28"> then it tilted and sank. </seg>
<seg id="29"> I saw my three children and wife as they screamed and swallowed water and I screamed and tried to save them but God was victorious. </seg>
<seg id="30"> They all drowned in front of my eyes, </seg>
<seg id="31"> their books and some of their games floated on the surface... </seg>
<seg id="32"> From him comes recompense. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In God only is there power and strength. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When the fire got really big, we heard the sound of explosions in Al-Ibara's kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We thought it was from gas cylinders exploding, </seg>
<seg id="36"> so we shouted at the captain to go back to the port of Safaga which was closer than Dhaba but he refused. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We became terrified and the captain ordered us to knock on doors to get passengers out of their cabins and assemble starboard side until the Al-Ibara regained its balance. But within five minutes everyone was drowning </seg>
<seg id="38"> and the shouting and wailing got louder. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Men were imploring God "Oh Lord, save us... Oh Lord, have mercy on us" </seg>
<seg id="40"> &quot;  </seg>
<seg id="41"> Others were reciting the shahada. </seg>
<seg id="42"> **** </seg>
<seg id="43"> May God have mercy on all the victims of the accident and grant their loved ones patience and solace </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; Abu Suleiman </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Why does men's chastity no longer have any value or respect? </seg>
<seg id="4"> And is it now that a chaste man who rises above his sexual appetite gives rise to amazement and suspicion? </seg>
<seg id="5"> Why has become that a man who does not have Islamically unlawful sexual relations before marriage is a fool in the eyes of some? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Why has the man who does not betray his wife become a coward who fears his wife will find out or whose masculinity is doubted? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Our society is greatly concerned with female virginity, </seg>
<seg id="8"> but why doesn't anyone talk about male virginity? </seg>
<seg id="9"> In an era of openness and progress, which makes it easy to fall into what is sinful </seg>
<seg id="10"> Temptations surround us on every side and are no longer difficult </seg>
<seg id="11"> to have and there is nothing easier than inequality, which draws people into depravity. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But this is no excuse to justify what is forbidden, </seg>
<seg id="13"> And if women and men are subject to the same temptations, then they are equal in punishment and accountability. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to God's law, God Almighty says: (Tell the believing men that they shall lower their eyes and maintain their chastity and tell the believing women that they shall lower their eyes and maintain their chastity). </seg>
<seg id="15"> And as it is more preferable and fairer to measure our behavior according to God's rules and laws, we see that it gives clear indications that the concept is to be applied to both men and women. </seg>
<seg id="16"> God Almighty said: {The chaste men, the chaste women, and the men who remember God frequently and the women who remember Him, God has prepared for them forgiveness and a great recompense} [Al-Ahzab:35] </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore men's chastity is no less important than women's chastity and does not diminish his manhood and just as chastity is required of women, so it is also required of men. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We must broaden the concept of virginity to include both men and women so that there is equality. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But in our eastern societies, these concepts have become erroneous, </seg>
<seg id="20"> and chastity is expected of women only, which is their asset and the foundation of their family's honor, </seg>
<seg id="21"> whereas men's chastity is not an issue or a matter of shame. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Nothing is shameful for them, based on the principle that any sin is permitted as long as it is not made public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is a call to all to insist on chastity and to refrain from what is forbidden </seg>
<seg id="24"> and for us to abandon the common concept that male chastity is a dubious trait that a man is embarrassed by and avoids so that he is accused of stupidity, lack of education and poverty of experience. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Male chastity means modesty and it is an honorable trait. It means he keeps his faith and follows the right path, and takes refuge against sin and God Almighty's wrath and preserves his health from disease. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chastity begins in the heart then reaches the body and in a man, it is a clear sign of a strong character and raises him above and keeps him from adultery so that he quells his sexual appetites and disciplines himself against being drawn in by its lusts. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The chaste person is a rational person able to control his desires and cravings and who only allows himself to satisfy them with what pleases God. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He is a patient and fair person who is beyond vile acts and rises above his appetite. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He has rare qualities which only one whose faith is strong is capable of having. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The Holy Koran calls on every bachelor </seg>
<seg id="31"> {to Let those who do not enter into matrimony be chaste} </seg>
<seg id="32"> Thaleb interpreted this and said: </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let him control himself by fasting for it is self-denial. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Chastity is required of the married and unmarried. </seg>
<seg id="35"> How many men betray their wives and boast in their gatherings of their adventures so that they appear to be no less important than others or no less manly or so that they do not become laughingstocks? </seg>
<seg id="36"> My dear brother, I ask you not to weaken and to preserve your purity and your chastity. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Do not give in to temptation. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Try and strengthen your faith in God. </seg>
<seg id="39"> For if you weaken, remember that God sees you and you will be asked and we will all be asked about our actions and your manhood will not bring you God's forgiveness because God's commandments are clear. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Chastity is not required of women only, it is every human being's duty. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Do not let society be accountable for your actions. </seg>
<seg id="42"> If you evade accountability in the world, you will not escape punishment in the Afterlife. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Remember that death does not ask permission of anyone. </seg>
<seg id="44"> When it comes, it will not wait for you to repent. </seg>
<seg id="45"> For when their time comes, it comes not an hour later or an hour earlier. </seg>
<seg id="46"> If you have been content with the most vile of acts, do not expect and do not ask for the best of rewards. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Remember that reward is dependent on acts of piety. </seg>
<seg id="48"> and if you do this, do not expect God to favor you with a good wife. </seg>
<seg id="49"> God Almighty says in Surat Al-Nur (Bad women for bad men, and bad men for bad women, and good women for good men and good men for good women, they are innocent of such accusations, they have attained forgiveness and a generous reward) </seg>
<seg id="50"> &quot; </seg>
<seg id="51"> Lord, I ask you for chastity and prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="52"> &quot; </seg>
<seg id="53"> We ask God to guard the Muslim youth from wrongdoing and evil. </seg>
<seg id="54"> God is the best protector and the most compassionate of the compassionate. </seg>

<seg id="3"> They tightened her shackles... </seg>
<seg id="4"> They deprived her of her senses. </seg>
<seg id="5"> She felt as though she was put on what felt like a sedan... with its height and movement... </seg>
<seg id="6"> She heard the voice of her beloved among them. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Why didn't he berate them? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Why didn't he stop them taking her???? </seg>
<seg id="9"> The sound of dull footsteps walking on rough sand... </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cool dawn breezes touching her white clothes... </seg>
<seg id="11"> And even though she couldn't see, she imagined the weather around her to be misty... </seg>
<seg id="12"> She imagined the land she was in now to be empty, arid land... </seg>
<seg id="13"> .. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Finally, the footsteps stopped altogether and she felt herself being put down on the ground... </seg>
<seg id="15"> She heard a stone being lifted near her and another being put down... </seg>
<seg id="16"> then a second one being carried... and there was silence around her... she felt darkness enter her bones... </seg>
<seg id="17"> ... it was her son... yes him... </seg>
<seg id="18"> No doubt he had come to save her? </seg>
<seg id="19"> But... what was she hearing? </seg>
<seg id="20"> He was calling her softly: mother... </seg>
<seg id="21"> And through tears, her husband spoke to her saying: hold on... </seg>
<seg id="22"> Patience with the first shock... </seg>
<seg id="23"> Pray for her, my son... </seg>
<seg id="24"> Come on... </seg>
<seg id="25"> He was overwhelmed by a sigh... </seg>
<seg id="26"> He cast one last look at the shrouded body... and could not contain himself. He said in a voice dripping with pain: There is no God but God... </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is no God but God... </seg>
<seg id="28"> We come from Him and to Him we return </seg>
<seg id="29"> This is the last thing she heard from him... </seg>
<seg id="30"> Then the sound of marble stone falling from above to close the only opening that let through sound and light... and life... </seg>
<seg id="31"> The sound of footsteps retreating... </seg>
<seg id="32"> Where to? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Where are you leaving me? </seg>
<seg id="34"> How can you leave me, alone in this darkness? </seg>
<seg id="35"> She looked around her and suddenly saw... </seg>
<seg id="36"> Saw???? </seg>
<seg id="37"> What could she see in this dark cellar? </seg>
<seg id="38"> Its darkness was not the darkness of night she was used to... because that was accompanied by moonlight... and the rays of the stars was reflected on things and people... but here she could barely see her hand... she felt her eyes were completely blindfolded... </seg>
<seg id="39"> She remembered her loved ones... </seg>
<seg id="40"> She heard the footsteps fade away completely and a shudder ran through her body. </seg>
<seg id="41"> She got up to follow them... </seg>
<seg id="42"> How could they leave her when they knew she was frightened of the dark and of being alone? </seg>
<seg id="43"> But a heavy hand pushed her down roughly... </seg>
<seg id="44"> She looked behind her with extreme fear... and saw something she had never seen before... </seg>
<seg id="45"> She saw the Sphinx had become embodied as a creature... </seg>
<seg id="46"> But how could she see him in spite of the intense blackness? </seg>
<seg id="47"> She said in a trembling voice," Who are you?" </seg>
<seg id="48"> She heard a resounding high-pitched voice to her right, We have come to ask you..." </seg>
<seg id="49"> She turned round... </seg>
<seg id="50"> There was another creature similar to the first... </seg>
<seg id="51"> She was dumbstruck... </seg>
<seg id="52"> She wished the earth would swallow her up so that she wouldn't see these entities... </seg>
<seg id="53"> But then she remembered the earth had actually swallowed her up... </seg>
<seg id="54"> She wished for death to escape this reality from which there was no escape... </seg>
<seg id="55"> Then she despaired that her wishes were no good... because she was actually dead... </seg>
<seg id="56"> - Who is your God? </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Ha... Who is your God? </seg>
<seg id="58"> - My God? </seg>
<seg id="59"> I have worshiped only God all my life... </seg>
<seg id="60"> - What is your religion? </seg>
<seg id="61"> My religion is Islam... </seg>
<seg id="62"> - Who is your prophet? </seg>
<seg id="63"> - My prophet? </seg>
<seg id="64"> She wracked her memory </seg>
<seg id="65"> What was the matter, she had forgotten his name? </seg>
<seg id="66"> Was it not always on her lips? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Did she not always bless his name five times a day in her prayers? </seg>
<seg id="68"> With an angry voice, the voice asked her again: who is your prophet? </seg>
<seg id="69"> A moment, please... </seg>
<seg id="70"> I can't remember... </seg>
<seg id="71"> A big stick was held aloft in the creature's hand... </seg>
<seg id="72"> She screamed... </seg>
<seg id="73"> Her limbs tensed... </seg>
<seg id="74"> Suddenly, the name came into her mind: </seg>
<seg id="75"> She shouted at the top of her voice: the Prophet Mohammed... </seg>
<seg id="76"> Mohammed.... </seg>
<seg id="77"> Then she shut her eyes tightly... but... nothing happened... </seg>
<seg id="78"> A deathly silence... </seg>
<seg id="79"> She opened her eyes in surprise... </seg>
<seg id="80"> The creature whose name was Nakir said: You were saved by a prayer you always repeated (O Lord, you who turns hearts, make my heart steadfast in your religion). </seg>
<seg id="81"> A shiver went through her body... </seg>
<seg id="82"> She wanted to smile with joy... but she couldn't... </seg>
<seg id="83"> This was not the place to smile... </seg>
<seg id="84"> O Lord, when will these difficult moments end? </seg>
<seg id="85"> A short while later Munkir said to her," you delayed in praying the dawn prayer..." </seg>
<seg id="86"> She opened hr eyes wide... </seg>
<seg id="87"> She knew there was no way out this time... </seg>
<seg id="88"> because it was not untrue... </seg>
<seg id="89"> He pushed her in front of him... </seg>
<seg id="90"> She wanted to cry but tears found no way out... </seg>
<seg id="91"> She walked in front of Munkir and Nakir along a long cellar until she reached a place that looked like a prison. </seg>
<seg id="92"> ... </seg>
<seg id="93"> She felt sick... </seg>
<seg id="94"> She wished she could faint... but it didn't happen... </seg>
<seg id="95"> She continued to look at the terrifying place... </seg>
<seg id="96"> At every point, there was screaming and blood... </seg>
<seg id="97"> wailing and destruction... </seg>
<seg id="98"> bones being broken... </seg>
<seg id="99"> bodies being burned... </seg>
<seg id="100"> Cruel faces with no mercy in their hearts for they did not respond to all this supplication... </seg>
<seg id="101"> The angels pushed her from behind so she walked, feeling that her feet could no longer carry her... </seg>
<seg id="102"> She came to a man lying on his back... </seg>
<seg id="103"> and standing over his head was an angel, one of the ones with a cold, hard face... </seg>
<seg id="104"> holding a heavy stone... </seg>
<seg id="105"> Right before her eyes, the angel dropped the stone on the man's head... it smashed and broke off his body, rolling down... </seg>
<seg id="106"> She screamed </seg>
<seg id="107"> She cried... </seg>
<seg id="108"> Then she was so astonished that  she stopped speaking ... </seg>
<seg id="109"> The head quickly came back to its owner... </seg>
<seg id="110"> And the angel dropped the stone on him again... </seg>
<seg id="111"> Here... it was said to her:, "Come on... lie next to this man... - What?" </seg>
<seg id="112"> - Come on... </seg>
<seg id="113"> She was pushed roughly... </seg>
<seg id="114"> She resisted... </seg>
<seg id="115"> and resisted... </seg>

<seg id="117"> to no avail... </seg>
<seg id="118"> He fate was dark... </seg>
<seg id="119"> truly dark... </seg>
<seg id="120"> She lay down, with fear churning her stomach... </seg>
<seg id="121"> She prayed to God... </seg>
<seg id="122"> but saw all the doors of prayers closed... </seg>
<seg id="123"> The time for prayer in this hour of need was gone... </seg>
<seg id="124"> ... if only she had prayed in times of plenty ... </seg>
<seg id="125"> If only she had prayed in the world... </seg>
<seg id="126"> If only she could go back to pray two prayers... </seg>
<seg id="127"> Just two prayers... to have mercy... </seg>
<seg id="128"> She looked up and saw an angel standing over her... </seg>
<seg id="129"> holding a big stone in his hand... </seg>
<seg id="130"> saying to her," this is your punishment on Judgment Day... because you slept instead of doing your duties..." </seg>
<seg id="131"> When despair overtook her... she saw a young man as bright as the moon walking towards her quickly... </seg>
<seg id="132"> A feeling of hope rose within her... </seg>
<seg id="133"> His face was full of joy and his smile lit up everything around him... </seg>
<seg id="134"> The young man came and put up his hand to stop the angel... </seg>

<seg id="1"> How to transfer a cassette tape onto CD </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt;  Mr. AbuEin </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Since the age of cassettes started, it is almost impossible to find a house free of cassettes, </seg>
<seg id="4"> and with the ease of the use of cassettes and their cheap price, they are now found in every house, car, office and every other place. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Some of these tapes are originals, professionally recorded and more expensive, some are recorded at home and such recordings may be valuable and of a special memory, or they might be a copy of songs or other things. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And because we are now in the digital age, this does not mean we have to erase our memories. </seg>
<seg id="7"> We can transfer these sound recordings, whether they are cassette tapes or 1/4 inch reels or records and change them into an MP3 digital format on digital CDs. This allows you to hear it on a computer and CD players and to email it anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Preparation of systems and equipment: </seg>
<seg id="9"> To be able to transfer tape recordings into a digital format on CD-ROMs, you first have to equip your computer with the necessary equipment and programs to be able to do this. You need a relatively new computer with a sound card. </seg>
<seg id="10"> To start, you have to connect the cassette player you have to the computer. This is usually done with the common lead shown in the photo here. This lead can be found in any place where electrical equipment accessories are sold and is usually cheap. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One end of the lead must be attached to the line-out outlet and the other end must be connected to the line-in outlet on the computer sound card. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Another thing is the need for a program that can record sound which comes through the sound card line-in. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The best and easiest program to use is MusicMatch Jukebox. This program has many useful applications, and most importantly you can get it free on the internet. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Download and set up the program on your computer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You can visit the website to download it onto your computer. The address is http://www.musicmatch.com/ </seg>
<seg id="16"> or from this link. Click to download the program which is about 9 Mb. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So that you can use the recording in any place, as well as to have a large enough space needed by the sound on the hard CD, it's best to have a CD recording system. </seg>
<seg id="18"> CD recording systems can also read CDs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This equipment uses two kinds of CDs and these two kinds of CDs can record sound and information related to computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first CD type can be recorded on once while the other can be recorded on several times. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The second is better but it's several times more expensive than the first. </seg>
<seg id="22"> To get going: </seg>
<seg id="23"> Step one: </seg>
<seg id="24"> After setting up the MusicMatch program and attaching the stereo to the sound card using the lead mentioned before, you can start recording by following these steps: </seg>
<seg id="25"> Start the MusicMatch program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> From the menu, select Options then recorder then Source then Line-in. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A new window will now pop up under the first program's window. If it doesn't appear, click on REC. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In this window, you'll see the words Artist and Album. Click on them then change the name to the new recording name you're about to do. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Now click on REC in this window and start playing the cassette tape in the stereo. </seg>
<seg id="30"> When the recording finishes, click on Stop. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The recording should have ended and been placed in the program's music library. </seg>
<seg id="32"> You can repeat this process for any other recording. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Recordings are automatically saved at a speed of 128 kbps. This is more than enough for most tape recordings which need high quality. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Once the first recording is done, you need to test it out to check the sound level quality. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the recording is muddled or too soft, you can re-check the level of the sound input from the stereo to the computer or via the Windows program itself. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the bottom of the screen, you'll find an icon in the form of a megaphone on the Taskbar. Double click it and adjust the sound using Play Control or Volume Control. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Select Options then Properties then Recording and finally OK. You'll see a Record Control window. Select the required sound volume level. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Of course, make sure you don't use the Mute Button or you'll get nothing at all. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You can use extra recording features in this program to adjust various properties to improve sound. To do this, select Options then Settings then Recorder then Advanced. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In this box, select the sound effect you want such as Fades and so on to produce semi-professional MP3 recordings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> As you gain experience of this program and continue to make recordings, you'll become more familiar and find it easier and become quicker at turning your old analog recordings into digital recordings. </seg>
<seg id="42"> After you make MP3 recordings with a total length of 74 minutes at the most, you can start making a CD-ROM. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Step two: </seg>
<seg id="44"> After you select and collect enough MP3 recordings, you can make this into a list to record onto the CD-ROM in the order you want. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You'll find a recording list on the right-hand side of the MusicMatch Jukebox program. </seg>
<seg id="46"> To copy a song or musical piece onto this list, use the mouse to drag the file from the music library to this window. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In general, a recordable CD can hold 74 minutes of music (at present, the MusicMatch program isn't compatible with the new 80-minute recordable CD) </seg>
<seg id="48"> Once you've prepared the pieces of music you want to record onto disc, click the CD window and a new dialogue box will appear with several CD recording options. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Make sure you select Audio default as the disc type to search for. If you select the other option, you can store over 600 Megabytes on the blank CD but this type doesn't work with the usual CD players. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Status bar at the bottom of the window shows how much space is left on the CD. </seg>
<seg id="51"> You can add or delete from the recording list by using Test then write to the CD to produce more detailed CDs. </seg>
<seg id="52"> You may also want to leave a second's space or more between two tracks. </seg>
<seg id="53"> When you're ready to copy, put the blank CD in the CD recorder and click on Create CD. </seg>

<seg id="3"> One thousand new members every day </seg>
<seg id="4"> The new MySpace site is stealing the limelight from Google. </seg>
<seg id="5"> www.myspace.com </seg>
<seg id="6"> A promising new star in the world of the internet has recently begun to shine, especially after succeeding in coming up with a name that is reverberating in technology circles. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This newcomer has, in the course of only two years, attracted many more visitors and users than expected, bringing the number of users and visitors to two-and-a-half times the number of visitors to internet giant Google. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The MySpace site has proved itself to be serious and has become one of the most important internet communities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The secret of this site's success is how it has made use of its predecessors' mistakes and turned them into strengths which makes it very attractive to young people, especially students and musicians after it gave them the possibility of total interaction with their friends and provided the majority of services offered by other sites in one site. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some might question the secret of the site's success since it is not the only one of this kind but quite simply, why should its users need to go to another site when their friends are on MySpace, especially as users encourage their friends and urge them to join the site. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is also doing better than its competitors because it is more open to customization which gives the user greater scope for adding a personal touch to his page through background color, layouts, images, videos and many other specifications. The feature that has set it apart from even its most tenacious competitor, Friendster, with registered users now at 54 million (a rate of 180,000 new members a day) compared to 24 million users on the Friendster site. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This new site brings in a new tool to allow you to talk to your acquaintances and friends, it has cancelled the main page, the need to download emails or an instant messenger program, the page through which the user can chat and swap emails as well as being able to listen to teachers and lessons. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the midst of all this success, internet dangers hang over teenagers to cast a shadow over the site's success, especially since the number of minors registered with the site has reached a quarter of its total users. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Many school children all over the United States of America were arrested after they threatened their school friends over the internet. In addition, the police in one state discovered cases of illegal relations with minors who got to know men who pretended to be younger than their age on the site. This led to parents and guardians stopping their children from using the sites because of fears about dangers such as this. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This has not stopped the site owners from moving forward to develop it and provide international services to broaden the scope of users to bring in users from all over the world under the slogan "We'll do anything to make our users stay with us." </seg>

<seg id="3"> This is how love is </seg>
<seg id="4"> Main: Wednesday 9 Muharram 1427 AH - February 8, 2006 CE, Islam Diary: </seg>
<seg id="5"> For Muslims to know the status of their Prophet Peace Be Upon Him... and for Muslims to know what real love for this great prophet is...these were the situations </seg>
<seg id="6"> Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him... </seg>
<seg id="7"> Here are the feelings that Abu Bakr's heart puts into words that can be read, </seg>
<seg id="8"> Abu Bakr says, "We were making the migration and I was thirsty, very thirsty, so I brought some yoghurt drink and gave it to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said to him," Drink, O Prophet of God"." </seg>
<seg id="9"> Abu Bakr said, "The Prophet (peace be upon him) drank and my thirst was quenched!!" </seg>
<seg id="10"> Your eyes are not lying!! </seg>
<seg id="11"> The word is right and intentional, this is how Abu Bakr Al-Sadiq told it... </seg>
<seg id="12"> Can you taste the beauty of this love? </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a special kind of love!! </seg>
<seg id="14"> How do we compare with such love!? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Here it is and don't be surprised, </seg>
<seg id="16"> it is love, </seg>
<seg id="17"> love for the prophet above the self... </seg>
<seg id="18"> On the day Mecca was liberated, Abu Qahafa (the father of Abu Bakr) became a Muslim. He turned to Islam very late in life and was blind so Abu Bakr took him to see the Prophet (peace be upon him) so that he could declare his faith in Islam and pay homage to the Prophet (peace be upon him). </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "O Abu Bakr, you should have left the sheikh in his house and we would have gone to see him". </seg>
<seg id="20"> Abu Bakr said, "You are the more worthy of being visited, O Prophet of God". </seg>
<seg id="21"> Abu Qahafa became a Muslim... and Abu Bakr Al-Sadiq began to weep. </seg>
<seg id="22"> They said to him," This is a joyous day, your father has become a Muslim and avoided Hell, so why then do you weep?" </seg>
<seg id="23"> Imagine... What did Abu Bakr say? </seg>
<seg id="24"> He said, "Because I would have liked the person to be paying homage to the Prophet not to be my father but rather Abu Talib, because that would please the Prophet more". Glory to God, his joy at the Prophet's joy is greater than his joy for his father. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Where are we compared to all this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Omar (may God be pleased with him) says, "I was walking with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and with us were some of his Companions. God's prophet took my hand as we walked". </seg>
<seg id="27"> Omar says, "I found myself saying:,"I swear by God, O Prophet of God, I love you!" " </seg>
<seg id="28"> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, "More than your son, O Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="29"> I said, "Yes". </seg>
<seg id="30"> He said," More than your parents, O Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="31"> I said yes، </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said, "More than your money, O Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="33"> I said "yes". </seg>
<seg id="34"> He said," More than yourself, O Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="35"> I said, "No" [Look at his truthfulness to himself and to the Prophet (peace be upon him)]. </seg>
<seg id="36"> So the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "No, O Omar, your faith will not be whole until I am more beloved to you than own self." </seg>
<seg id="37"> Omar says, "I went out and reflected then came back chanting: I swear by God, O Prophet of God, you are more beloved to me than myself." </seg>
<seg id="38"> The Prophet (peace be upon him), "Now, O Omar, now". </seg>
<seg id="39"> Abdullah Bin Omar said, "What did you do, my father, to come with this?" </seg>
<seg id="40"> Omar said, "I went out and asked myself who I needed more on Judgment day, myself or God's Prophet?" </seg>
<seg id="41"> I found that my need for him was greater than my need for myself, </seg>
<seg id="42"> and I remembered that I had strayed from the right path and God saved me through him. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Abdullah Bin Omar said, "O father, if you were to forget everything about God's Prophet, what is the thing you could never forget?" </seg>
<seg id="44"> Omar said, "If I were to forget what I have forgotten, I will never forget the day I went to him saying: Permit me to go on a pilgrimage, O Prophet of God." </seg>
<seg id="45"> He said to me, "Do not forget us my brother in your prayers of goodwill." </seg>
<seg id="46"> He said a word, what pleases me is what there is for me is life! </seg>
<seg id="47"> Those who only read these words will not feel them... </seg>
<seg id="48"> They are, I swear by God, sentiments that need a heart that loves the Prophet (peace be upon him) to receive them as they are meant... tender and soft </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thawban (may God be pleased with him) </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Prophet (peace be upon him) was away and left his servant with Thawban. When he returned, Thawban said to him "I missed you, O Prophet of God" and wept. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, "This makes you weep?" </seg>
<seg id="52"> Thawban said, "No, O Prophet of God, but I remembered your place in Heaven and my place, and I remembered loneliness." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And God Almighty's words were revealed {He who obeys God and the Prophet, these are with those God has been pleased with, of prophets and righteous people and martyrs and the pious; fair company are they}[69] Surat Al-Nissa. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Sawad (may God be pleased with him) </seg>
<seg id="55"> On the day of the Uhad Battle, Sawad Bin Izzya was standing in the ranks of the army when the Prophet (peace be upon him)said to the army, "Stand straight... stand erect." </seg>
<seg id="56"> The Prophet looked and saw Sawad was not being disciplined. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Stand straight, O Sawad." </seg>
<seg id="58"> Sawad said," Yes, O Messenger of God But he did not stand straight." </seg>
<seg id="59"> We heard the trunk wail at being parted from the Prophet (peace be upon him). </seg>
<seg id="60"> The Prophet (peace be upon him) came and with his stick tickled Sawad on the stomach. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Sawad said, "You hurt me, O Messenger of God, and God has sent you with the truth, so lead me!" </seg>
<seg id="62"> When they built the pulpit for him, he left the trunk and went to the pulpit. </seg>
<seg id="63"> We saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) leave the pulpit and go back to the tree and stroke it. </seg>
<seg id="64"> He said," Stand straight, O Sawad." </seg>
<seg id="65"> The Prophet (peace be upon him) was orating at his mosque, before the pulpit was built, next to a tree trunk when his Companions saw him... the Prophet (peace be upon him) stood touching the trunk. </seg>
<seg id="66"> What do you think of this love? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Lastly, do not be less than the trunk. </seg>
<seg id="68"> He said, "O Prophet of God, I think today is a day of martyrdom so my last wish is for my skin to touch your skin." </seg>
<seg id="69"> The Prophet peace be upon him says, "Are you not happy to be buried here and be with me in Heaven?" </seg>
<seg id="70"> The trunk became still... </seg>
<seg id="71"> Sawad bent eagerly to kiss the Prophet's stomach. He said, "This is what I wanted." </seg>
<seg id="72"> The Prophet revealed his noble stomach and said, Retaliate, O Sawad." </seg>

<seg id="4"> Title: Why is most of the Koran addressed to males? </seg>
<seg id="5"> Answerer: Doctor Mohammed Hussein Al-Jizani, member of the teaching staff at the Islamic University, the Prophet's City </seg>
<seg id="6"> New category 12/01/1427 Hijra </seg>
<seg id="7"> Question: In the Koran, we see that in general that God addresses men, and this is also true in the Prophet's Hadith. Why is this? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Answer: Praise be to God and peace be upon God's prophet: </seg>
<seg id="9"> This question was asked by the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salma (may God be pleased with her) when she said, "I said to the Prophet (peace be upon him): Why is it that we are not mentioned in the Koran as men are?" </seg>
<seg id="10"> God sent down his words: "Muslim men and Muslim women, male believers and female believers... [Al-Ahzab:35]. Source Ahmed (26575) and Al-Tabari's interpretation (22/10). </seg>
<seg id="11"> As the Holy Koran was revealed in the language of the Arabs and in the way they addressed women, women are included when men are addressed because the masculine takes precedence over the feminine in Arabic. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The man says, "Come in" and "go out". In this way, he addresses all those present, both males and females. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the language of the Arabs, it is not correct to say Come in (masculine) and come in (feminine), and go out (masculine) and go out (feminine). </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is also clear from the Sharia and its intended meanings that the obligation to abide by Sharia law concerns both men and women because all have obligations and all are addressed, all are accountable, rewardable and punishable. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is the unchanging basis and general rule and it is that men and women are bound by religious laws in equal measure. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, there are some rules that apply to men and not women, such as gold and silk being forbidden and the duties of Friday prayer and Jihad. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Allah's tradition concerning someone whom Muslims are not able to take revenge against such as someone who insults the messenger or harms him http://www.dorar.net/book_view.asp?book_id=7435 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Shiekhul Islam Ibn Taymiyya - may Allah have mercy on him - said, "it is part of Allah's tradition that Allah The Almighty will take revenge for His Messenger against anyone who has harmed Allah and His Messenger whom the believers cannot punish and this will be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The story of Allah destroying those who made fun one by one is well-known. The exegetes of the Koran mentioned them. They were a number of people from among the leaders of the Quraysh; among them were Walid Ibn Mughirah, Al-Aas Bin Wa'il, Al-Aswadan Bin Al-Mutallib, Ibn Abd Yaguth and Al-Harith Bin Qais. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The Prophet, may Allah's peace be upon him, wrote to the Chosroe and the Byzantine Emperor and both of them did not accept Islam but the Byzantine Emperor honored the letter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon him, and he honored His Messenger. He recognized his authority and it is said that he said, "the power will remain among his offspring until the day (1)", </seg>
<seg id="7"> and the Chosroe tore up the letter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon Him, and he mocked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon Him, so Allah killed him after a while and his reign was torn apart and the Chosroes lost their authority. Furthermore, Allah knows best. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In Al-Kalam Al-Sa'ir, it says, "the flesh of scholars is poisoned"; how then is the flesh of the prophets, peace be upon them? </seg>
<seg id="9"> In Sahih, it said about the Prophet, may Allah's peace be upon him, "Allah the Almighty says, "whoever is an enemy of a close friend of mine has entered battle against Me"; how then is it for those who are enemies of the prophets? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Whoever fights Allah has been fought. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If you read some of the stories of the prophets mentioned in the Koran, you will find that their peoples were destroyed when they harmed the prophets or did horrible things to them or said terrible things to them. This was the case of the Children of Israel; they were humiliated and earned Allah's anger. They did not have a protector when they killed the prophets unjustly bringing them into disbelief, as Allah stated in His book. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Perhaps, you will not find anyone who insulted any of the prophets and did not repent excepted that Allah inflicted a calamity on him. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We have mentioned what the Muslims experienced when trying to expedite revenge against the disbelievers who insulted the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon him, and we have mentioned such things through various events. This is an enormous chapter. We have not gone into depth in it here. Our intention was to state the Shariah ruling on it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Similar to this is what lots of honest Muslims with understanding and experience have discussed with us about what they experienced many times in the blockade of forts and cities on the Syrian coast, when the Muslims besieged the Byzantines in our time. They said, "we used to lay siege to a fort or a city for a month or more than a month and it was not possible for us to enter until we almost gave up hope unless its people dared to insult the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon him, and dishonored him, it would then make it faster for us to conquer and made it easier. It would take no more than a day or two or something like that, then the place would be conquered violently and there would be a great massacre of them". They said, "we would even rejoice that the conquest would be soon if we heard them slander him with our hearts full of hate for them for what they said about him". </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some of our honest brothers from Morocco have told me similar stories about their situation with Christians as well. It is Allah's tradition that He punishes His enemies sometimes with punishment from Him and sometimes at the hands of His faithful servants. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Almighty protected him and took away the harm and insults of people in all ways, even in their words. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the Sahihain, it is narrated that Abu Huraira said, "the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon him, said, "do you not see how Allah has turned away the Quraysh's insults and curses? They insult objectionably and they curse objectionably and I am Muhammad", so Allah made his name honorable and saved him from harm and turned it on to the one who is objectionable, as if the insulter had intended himself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What proves that insulting is a crime in addition to being disbelief and an act of war - even if it included that - is that the prophet, may Allah's peace be upon him, would forgive the hypocrites who harmed him as they came closer to the Koran and he would kill them as is mentioned in the hadith narrated by Abu Bakr and others. </seg>
<seg id="19"> If insulting was merely an act of apostasy, it would enjoin killing this person just as the apostate must be killed. It must be known that he may succeed in insulting the prophet, may Allah's peace be upon him, in that he can be forgiven. </seg>
<seg id="20"> What proves that insulting is a singular crime is that if a dhimmi insulted a Muslim or someone the Muslims have pledged to protect, he nullifies his right to protection; is insulting the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon him not insulting anyone? </seg>
<seg id="21"> He said, may Allah have mercy on him, "purifying the earth of traces of insults against the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace be upon him, is obligatory where possible, because it is one of the clear signs of the religion of Allah, the superiority of the word of Allah and of all religion belonging to Allah. Furthermore, the earth must also be purified of fornication, theft, highway robbery where possible, whereas purifying it of disbelief is not obligatory to allow the People of the Two Books to continue following their religion as dhimmis because by establishing them as dhimmis means they must adhere to the course of Allah and his Messenger's rule over them by not denying His religion or the superiority of the word. A truce is permitted to be made with a disbeliever and to protect him if he is weak or if there is a desired purpose in this. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The world must be purified of all crimes insofar as is possible, the punishment for the perpetrator being determined in the law unless it has a specific merit; it is obligatory to kill this person, because this crime does not have a specific merit, because it concerns the right of Allah, His Messenger and all the believers. For this reason, there is a difference between an insulter and a disbeliever, who is allowed to admit his disbelief in private and adhere to the rules of Allah and His Messenger, contrary to the view on insults. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Is a Muslim allowed to read the Koran or invoke (in the mind) God's name in his heart, without uttering it, while in the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Answer: </seg>
<seg id="5"> Thanks be to God. </seg>
<seg id="6"> There are two types of invocation: Invocation through utterance, such as reading the Koran and invocations and prayers which it is desirable to do, and invocation in the heart by thinking about God Almighty and his greatness and abilities, and thinking about God Almighty's creatures and reciting the Koran in the heart. This recitation of the Koran does not carry the same merit as reading the Koran out loud which can only be done verbally. This is also true of prayers which have to be uttered verbally and cannot simply be recited in the heart. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Religious thinkers make a distinction between the two types of invocation and say: It is hateful to invoke God's name in the bathroom verbally to glorify him in this place. As for invoking his name in the heart, they say: This is not hateful and is acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The differences between the two kinds of invocation of God's name is that religious thinkers agree that one can think of the Koran in the heart but reading it and uttering it aloud are forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Al-Nuwawi said: They agreed that if the Koran is recited in thought without the tongue moving then the reader will not have committed the sin of forbidden reading. Al-Nuwawi's commentary on correct Muslim conduct (4/103). </seg>
<seg id="10"> Ibn Al-Munthir says: Aqruma said do not invoke God's name with your tongue while in the WC but only in your heart. Al-Awsat (1/341). </seg>
<seg id="11"> The Permanent Committee says: Muslim etiquette is for a person to invoke God's name when he wants to enter the WC or bathroom and to say before entering:" God I implore you to guard me against what is foul and obnoxious" and not to invoke God after entering but to remain silent once he has entered. Advisory Opinion of the Permanent Committee (5/93). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Sheikh Abdulaziz Baz says: Invocation in the heart is permissible at all times and in all places, in the bathroom and elsewhere. But what is hateful in the bathroom and thereabouts is invoking God's name verbally to glorify him, unless his name is mentioned during ablutions because this is permissible if it is not possible to perform ablutions outside the bathroom since this is a duty according to some religious thinkers and a convention among people in general. Advisory Opinion of Sheikh Ibn Baz (5/408). God alone is all-knowing. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Oslo, February 6 (A.F.P.) - Terje Roed-Larsen, the former UN envoy to the Middle East, considered that the situation in that region was never at the level of danger in which it is today, and compared the region to "a powder keg with a lit fuse." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Speaking to the Norwegian Public Radio "NRK", Roed-Larsen said: "In a lot of respects, the region now can be compared to a powder keg with a lit fuse." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Among the current and latent crises in the Middle East, Roed-Larsen mentioned the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Iranian nuclear issue and the crisis between Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He said: "All this brings us back to issues of fundamental values and opinions that make the situation more vulnerable to getting out of control at any moment than it has in recent days." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Roed-Larsen did not explicitly mention the acts of violence that occurred during demonstrations in the Islamic world in protest against the publication in European newspapers of cartoons about the Prophet Mohammad, but only emphasized the necessity of "dialogue" instead of "throwing stones and lighting fires." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Demonstrators burned the two buildings of the Danish and Norwegian Embassies in Damascus on Saturday, whereas a building housing an office of the Danish Embassy in Beirut was burned, in reaction to the publication in September of drawings in the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten and their subsequent re-publication in a number of European media channels led by the Norwegian magazine "Magasinet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Roed-Larsen is currently in charge of monitoring the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1559 that stipulates the disarming of militias and armed groups in Lebanon, including, according to that international organization, the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and Palestinian groups. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas Rejects what Parties within Fatah Consider to be Exposing the Palestinian National Plan to Danger </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Taher Al-Majzoub </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (A re-run with clarification in paragraph 4) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ramallah (The West Bank) 2-8 (AFP) - Some leaders in the Fatah Movement have expressed their fear that the Palestinian national plan might be endangered when the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas of the Palestinian Authority takes power, but the Islamic Movement strongly rejected this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Adnan Al-Damiri, one of the leaders of Fatah in the West Bank affirmed to Agence France Presse that "Hamas as a part of the worldwide Moslem Brotherhood Movement is not concerned with the regional issue of the Palestinian State as much as it is concerned with the international issue of Islam." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And he said, "The other aspect is that Hamas is a resistance movement that can be compared with the Taliban and Chechen movements, and this is a characteristic that distinguishes it from the rest of the Islamic movements in the Arab and Islamic world, but Hamas has not executed operations outside the borders of Palestine." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Al-Damiri, who ran as a candidate for the Fatah Movement in the last elections and did not win, felt that the difference between Hamas and Fatah is that "Fatah has a program that calls for seeking through negotiations to establish a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital East Jerusalem, on the basis of the 1967 borders, and that Fatah considers this solution to be strategic, whereas Hamas sees it as provisional." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the same vein, a Palestinian official who refused to disclose his identity asserted that Hamas "belongs to the Islamic tide that does not care for the establishment of a regional state as much as it cares for setting up the Islamic Caliphate, and as such its interests may intersect with Tehran and Damascus, and it is a candidate for an alliance with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran and the Moslem Brotherhood in any country in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He added, "Even Syria may use it in the context of a continuation of its policy aiming at trying to exploit the Palestinian and Lebanese causes as a card to pressure Israel, particularly since the Baath Party also considers the regional issue a secondary one relative to Arab nationalism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Consequently, if Hamas agrees to a truce with Israel for a period of ten or 15 years, it might retreat on the issue of liberation and focus on imposing the Islamic project on society, as he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> More than one official in Hamas has affirmed that the Islamic Movement, which is preparing to form the new Palestinian government, is ready to enter into a long term truce with Israel. </seg>

<seg id="12"> In a conversation with France Presse, Parliament Representative for Hamas, Mahmoud Al-Rimhi, vehemently denied that Hamas is jeopardizing the Palestinian national plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He said, "This is a claim with no basis in truth. Israel's unilateral policy started before Hamas won, and this was when the Fatah Movement was in power because Oslo (agreements)(1994) did not specify when settlement activity will end, nor borders for the Palestinian State." As a result, the Movement has no responsibility in jeopardizing the Palestinian plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He also added that Israel decided within the same unilateral policy "to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and build the separation wall before Hamas' victory and even before a date for the legislative elections was designated, and before Hamas' decision to participate in them," asserting that "Israel does not respect any of the agreements made, and negotiations did not stop this. The only solution is to continue the resistance." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The chief of the political bureau of the Hamas Movement, Khaled Meshaal, announced today, Wednesday, that the Movement could commit to "a long truce" with Israel if it withdraws to the 1967 borders and "recognized Palestinian rights." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Al-Rimhi said, "The truce with its conditions, which are the establishment of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, including East Jerusalem and releasing the detainees," affirming, "If we cannot achieve those conditions and if Israel does not release any prisoner and does not withdraw from the West Bank, then Hamas will be released from the pacification it agreed to in the Cairo Agreement." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Ahmad Saadat, the Secretary General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told France Presse from his prison in Jericho, "We have no fear that any Palestinian party will abandon the Palestinian plan because the battle is fundamentally with the Israeli occupation, and we have not heard from the Hamas Movement any abandonment of the principles of the Palestinian cause under any banner or program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He affirmed that "The attachment to these principles and the resistance to the occupation are common denominators," and "the resistance is tied to the existence of the occupation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saadat added, "We are awaiting what Hamas will offer, and what is required from all the forces of the Palestinian society is a democratic vision and an internal concordance as a first part in the election of the members of the Legislative Council. The second part should be reflected in the participation of our citizens abroad through direct voting." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It is to be noted that both the Popular Front and Hamas reject the Oslo agreements and the roadmap plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Similarly, Bassam Al-Salehi, Parliament Representative for the Parliamentary Alternative Bloc (People's Party - Left), said, "It is premature to draw general or hasty conclusions for several reasons, including that Hamas' victory does not necessarily mean political imbalance in an absolute manner." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Rather, he called for "looking again at the results because support for Hamas in the Palestinian street does not exceed half the voters, 40%," adding, "I think that the program of the Liberation Organization, independence, international legitimacy and the Arab peace initiative, has the majority in the Palestinian street." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Al-Salehi said, "It is difficult for any political movement to reach agreements on less than this program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Al-Salehi pointed out that his bloc "is thinking of proposing a draft resolution in the Legislative Council or in the Central Council of the Liberation Organization for declaring the 1967 borders as the borders of the Palestinian State, with its capital Jerusalem, and demands the world to recognize this (...) because the issue of the borders is not subject to negotiations, but a subject for conflict." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Al-Salehi affirmed, "Now we believe that the priority task is to rebuild the Palestinian democratic trend on clearer foundations in both its political and social arenas, and the basis is the independence document, because it defines a social vision for the political system that is based on a secular system." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tokyo 2-8 (AFP) - The Japanese company Suzuki said that it will soon announce its plans to participate in the World Rally Championship or not, without disclosing the details related to this matter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> David Farquhar, the media official and head of the Public Relations Department in the Japanese company, announced that the announcement will be made  on the sidelines of the Geneva Automobile Show at the end of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Several leaders of the World Rally Championship are discussing that Suzuki may join the family of official manufacturers beginning next year, since it currently participates in the category "Junior WRC" aboard Swift S1600. It garnered the title of the Swedish Rally Phase I of the championship of that category, and the second phase of the WRC Championship with its Swedish driver Per-Gunnar Andersson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Suzuki participated in many rallies outside the two categories in what constitutes a preparation for the possibility of its officially joining the senior category in the world championship. Reinforcing these expectations is its announcement today that it will make its decision on this matter on the 28th of this month (2:00 Geneva time). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If it decides to participate, this will constitute great support for the championship, particularly with the withdrawal of the French companies Citroen, the world champion for the past three years, and Peugeot, Japanese Mitsubishi, Czech Skoda and Korean Hyundai at the level of official participation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Citroen will return to the championship next year with a new car, C4, instead of Xsara, although it is offering a semi-official backing for the Belgian company Kronos Racing (Citroen Xsara) and its two drivers, the Frenchman Sebastien Loeb, world champion for the past two years, and his Spanish colleague Xavier Pons. It is also supporting his fellow citizen Daniel Sordo, champion of the "Junior WRC" last year who is following the footsteps of Loeb himself who was crowned champion of this category before he moved on to the senior category. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The number of official manufacturers in the championship, if Suzuki participates and Citroen returns next year will increase to four, with Subaru and Ford, which won the first two phases of the championship of this year with its new Finnish driver Marcus Groenholm. The other participations within the "Special Category" are limited, as is the case with the Finn Toni Gardemeister (Astra Racing - Peugeot 307) who missed the Swedish Rally after achieving third position in Monaco, Frenchman Gilles Banitzi (Red Bull - Skoda), and Italian Gigi Galli who is participating at his own private expense (Mitsubishi Lancer W, version 2005.) </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem 2-10 (AFP) - The Israeli Minister of Education, Meir Shitrit, said today, Friday, that the invitation by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Hamas leaders to visit Moscow is "a real stab in the back to Israel." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Minister said in a statement to Israel Public Radio, "This initiative is a real stab in the back (...) because its purpose is to give international legitimacy to a terrorist group, and we must oppose it by all means." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Minister continued, "What will Moscow say if we issue an invitation to the representatives of the Chechens to visit Jerusalem?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Shitrit added, "Russia, which prevents the holding of free elections in Chechnya, cannot be giving us moral lessons about the legitimacy of Hamas after the elections." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For his part, Housing Minister Zeev Boim said in a press statement that "Putin is playing with fire," and that he considers Russia's position "very worrisome." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A senior Israeli official had expressed since Thursday evening Israel's strong resentment for the latest Russian position, and said, "When the Chechens carry out an attack in Moscow, Russia considers it a terrorist act, but it is a different matter when it happens in Jerusalem," in reference to tens of suicide operations that Hamas executed over a period of ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Putin announced on Thursday from Madrid that he will "soon" invite Hamas officials to Moscow to hold discussions about the future of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>

<seg id="2"> By Nassib Azar </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Damascus 2-11 (AFP) - Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad issued today, Saturday, three presidential decrees making a ministerial change that brings 14 new ministers into the government. They particularly made changes in the posts pertaining to foreign affairs, in conjunction with the campaign of external pressures which Syria has been enduring for more than a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the first decree, Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa has been appointed "Vice-President in charge of implementing foreign and information policy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second decree makes changes in the government of Mohammad Naji Al-Otari, according to which 14 new ministers join the government in sensitive posts such as Foreign Affairs, the Interior and Information. According to the decree, Walid Al-Mouallem has been appointed Foreign Minister after having been Deputy to Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As to the third decree, it calls for appointing Syria's Representative to the United Nations, Faysal Al-Miqdad, as Deputy Foreign Minister to succeed Al-Mouallem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The ministerial shuffle did not affect the post of Prime Minister which remains under the presidency of Mohammad Naji Al-Otari, whereas Major General Bassam Abdel-Majid was appointed Minister of the Interior to replace Ghazi Kanaan who committed suicide on the 12th of last October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Major General Abdel-Majid has been Commander of the Military Police in Syria since 2002, and prior to that he was in charge at the Intelligence Services for the southern region of Syria. He was born in Quneitra in 1950. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> At the Ministry of Information, Mahdi Dakhlallah was dismissed and replaced by Mohsen Bilal, who was Syria's Ambassador in Spain for many years. He is an instructor at Damascus University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Sufian Allaou was appointed Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources to succeed Ibrahim Haddad, and Ghayath Barakat Minister of Higher Education to succeed Hani Murtada. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Minister of Defense Hassan Turkomani remains at his post, and similarly for Butheina Shaaban the Minister of Emigrants, Mohammad Al-Hussein the Finance Minister and Amer Hosni Lotfi the Minister of Economy and Commerce. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Joseph Soueid was appointed Minister of State, and he is the first member of the Social National Syrian Party to be appointed as Minister since the party joined the National Front in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Baath Party obtained the lion's share of the government as it received 19 ministries, including the prime minister's post, while seven ministers were appointed from seven parties represented in the Progressive National Front, to which seven independent Ministers were added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Progressive National Front comprises a group of ten parties led by the Baath Party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The custom has been that each of the nine parties in the National Front, except the Baath Party, gets represented by a Minister in the government, but the present ministerial change removed two parties from the representation, which are the Arab Socialist Union Party led by Safwan Qodsi, and the Movement of the Socialist Unionists led by Ghassan Abdel Aziz Othman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The other parties in the Front were represented by six Ministers of State, whereas the Communist Party received the Ministry of Irrigation represented by Youssef Al-Faysal, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This ministerial change was not unexpected since discussions about it have been ongoing since the suicide of the Interior Minister Ghazi Kanaan, whose post became vacant with his death on the 12th of this past October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> These ministerial changes coincide with a campaign of international pressures that Syria is exposed to, due to the investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, with two reports by the International Inquiry Commission pointing to the involvement of the Lebanese and Syrian Security Services in the assassination incident. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Sanaa 2-11 (AFP) - Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh carried out today, Saturday, a ministerial change, according to what the Yemeni Saba News Agency reported, after the escape of 23 presumed members of the Al-Qaeda organization from a Yemeni prison last week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Yemeni President decided to keep Prime Minister Abdel Qader Bajmal at the helm of the government and he dismissed the Minister of Defense Abdullah Ali Aliwah and 15 other Ministers. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Baghdad 2-13 (AFP) - The former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his seven aides today, Monday, caused a state of chaos during the 11th session of their trial by swearing at and interrupting the judge, whom they accused of bringing them to the courtroom against their will, in the absence of their defense team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Saddam Hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue-colored robe and a black vest. During his entry he repeated, "Down with the traitors, down with the traitors, down with Bush, long live the nation, long live the nation, long live the nation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The former President told the judge that he was forced to enter the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This was followed by a state of chaos since the accused objected to their being brought forcibly into the room. Ibrahim Barzan Al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's half-brother, shouted in the direction of the judge Rauf Rashid Abdel Rahman, "You are very far from mercy and these names. You are neither Mahmoud, nor Rauf. You are a military tribune and not a judge. We do not want to sit here in this place." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> And he added, "I cannot continue this session in the absence of my lawyer." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He continued saying that he was afflicted "with an incurable disease and medical tests have been done on me by the Americans in the American compound, which is why you have to set me free so I can receive the treatment. The law stipulates the necessity to release any accused who is afflicted with an incurable disease. I am dying gradually. You are killing me." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And when the judge told him that the Court agreed to present him to a medical panel, he said, "If you fear God, release me so I can receive the treatment with my family around me, and I will sign any pledge that I will attend the sessions. I have a case of honor and I want to defend my honor." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> He continued, "But if you think that the Baath Party needs me, then know that the Baath party works well and does not need me or anyone else, and this is its Secretary General (he points with his finger towards Saddam Hussein). He has been two years in jail, so set me free for the purpose of receiving treatment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The judge answered, "You have talked a lot and have taken a lot of the court's time." But Barzan interrupted him saying, "I have the right to talk until tomorrow." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> After that, Barzan Al-Tikriti noticed that the judge was ignoring his demands to be released, so he left his seat, sat on the floor and turned his back towards the judge, ignoring the trial session. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> And Saddam, who appeared angry as he carried the Qur'an in his hand, cursed the judge for forcing him to attend the session. And he said, "This is the custom of traitors, God is Greatest and let the despicable be driven away. May God curse your mustache." </seg>
</p>

<seg id="15"> He added, "This is not a court; this is a game." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Saddam told the judge, "You have no right to appoint lawyers for us instead of our lawyers, with my respect to them, because they have agreed to defend us, and my respect to every Iraqi." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The judge explained that "The Court has appointed substitute attorneys for the defense team according to Iraqi law, after the defense lawyers boycotted the session." But Saddam replied to him, "They did not boycott the sessions. Rather, it was you who expelled them, and in fact some of them were beaten up in front of you." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Judge Abdel-Rahman replied, "I do not permit you to discuss political matters." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="19"> But Saddam interrupted him, "You are an ignorant. What politics? You operate selectively and against the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Saddam Hussein and his former aides, and the defense panel, boycotted the tenth session of the trial which was convened on the eighth of this February after they withdrew from a preceding session, after a heated argument with the new judge who assumed the presidency of the Special Court, Rauf Rashid Abdel Rahman. </seg>

<seg id="23"> Attorney Khalil Al-Dulaimi, head of Saddam Hussein's defense panel, announced to Agence France Presse on Sunday in a telephone communication, "In my capacity as head of the defense panel team, I can confirm that no one from the defense team and not one of the accused will attend today's trial session." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Jaafar Al-Moussaoui, the Public Prosecutor of the Court, had declared that "The Court will convene a meeting prior to the trial session to look into the possibility of bringing the accused by force or leaving them on their own if they insist on not attending." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> He noted that "In case the Court makes any decision, it must be implemented irrespective of the nature of that decision." </seg>

<seg id="2"> Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) 2-13 (AFP) - The High Representative for Foreign Policy of the European Union, Javier Solana, carried a message of "Respect" to the Islamic World whereas the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, called on Europeans to adopt legislation to combat hostility toward Islam." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The meeting between the two men was held at the headquarters of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Jeddah on the Red Sea, in the midst of a crisis resulting from the publication in European newspapers of caricature cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, which Moslems considered offensive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Solana said after the meeting, "With regards to the European Union, we have profound respect for Moslems (...) and we never wanted to hurt their feelings," asserting that "this was never our intention and will never be so at any time." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He noted that he conveyed this message to Ihsanoglu by telephone, but insisted on conveying it to him in person as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For his part, Ihsanoglu emphasized the necessity for the Europeans to adopt legislation through the European Parliament to fight hostility toward Islam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Oglu said, "Unfortunately what is happening today (..) is that the Islamic world has begun to feel a new September 11 directed against it," in reference to the attacks that struck the United States in 2001. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Ihsanoglu called for including a principle mandating the necessity of respecting all religions and prohibiting their defamation in the founding statute of the new Human Rights Council presently being established. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Solana avoided responding directly to the question of enacting legislations of this kind. But he said that he does not see "any difficulty in approving such a provision if it were part of the foundations of the Human Rights Council that is presently being established." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This Council will replace the current Commission which is headquartered in Geneva and whose prestige and credibility have fallen greatly after it was shown that its operating methods allowed countries not committed to Human Rights to be represented among its ranks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Solana had announced on Wednesday that he will visit "a number of countries" in the region, including Saudi Arabia, in order to calm the anger that has spread over the Islamic world as a result of the publication of these cartoons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> According to the program of the visit, Solana goes after this meeting to Riyadh where he meets the Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faysal and King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz. </seg>

<seg id="13"> After Saudi Arabia, Solana goes to Egypt, where he meets President Hosni Mubarak and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States Amr Moussa, and after that to Jordan, and he will end his tour in the Palestinian territories and Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Secretary General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, had called in an address at the Jeddah Economic Forum on Sunday to extinguish "the evil spark" that was caused by the crisis of the publication of cartoons that are offensive to the Prophet Mohammad, rejecting a return to "the Crusades." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Moussa said, "This era is not appropriate for a conflict between East and West. Let us put our hands, we the Moslems who are desirous of a positive relationship, in the hands of our brothers in Europe and America who share such an opinion with us, and they are many, to extinguish this evil spark." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The cartoons that are offensive to the Prophet Mohammad were published for the first time in a Danish newspaper last September before they were published in several other European newspapers in the name of freedom of expression. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Iran Confirms its Resumption of Uranium Enrichment Process (Collected News) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Siavosh Ghazi </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tehran 2-14 (AFP) - Tehran confirmed today, Tuesday, the resumption of the uranium enrichment process at the Natanz plant, refusing to suspend "its research" in this field, while Western countries made a condition of stopping this process before resuming negotiations with Tehran over Tehran's nuclear program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Javad Vaeedi, a member of the Supreme National Security Council and in charge of the nuclear issue, announced that "activities have started" at the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz (central). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Tehran had announced on Monday the removal of the seals and the dismantling of the surveillance cameras belonging to the International Atomic Energy Agency at the Natanz plant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Diplomatic sources in Vienna, the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency, had announced that Iran has resumed enrichment activities at that site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But Vaeedi refused to comment on statements saying that the Iranians started the enrichment process itself by pumping uranium hexafluoride gas into the centrifuges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He told journalists after an address he delivered before an Islamic association of Tehran students, "I cannot answer you regarding these technical issues." He asserted that "It is unacceptable that we stop our research," noting that "the core of the nuclear program is the enrichment" of uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The resumption of the enrichment process itself had caused the cessation of dialogue with the Europeans last August, then again in January after its resumption in December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Those countries adopted on February 4th a decision at the International Atomic Energy Agency in which they asked Iran to suspend all its sensitive activities and notified the international Security Council of the Iranian issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But Tehran, instead of complying, responded by announcing the end of the advanced monitoring regime that is conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency on its nuclear program, and the resumption of all activities that were suspended, particularly those associated with large-scale enrichment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Natanz plant comprises two enrichment units, one is a project that focuses on research, and the other consists of an industrial scale facility that is being completed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> And about this unit, Vaeedi said that Iran "needs time for its industrial capability to be complete with about 60,000 centrifuges (to enrich uranium) but we have started our activities." He clarified that his country does not see "any reason at the present time to return to a suspension" of its activities at that site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Vaeedi justified the series of unilateral initiatives that his country undertook since "the Europeans, after they displayed good intentions during the past three years, they requested a complete abandonment of the nuclear fuel cycle." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Europeans especially refuse that Iran conducts uranium enrichment on its territory because they consider that this country has not yet proven that its nuclear program is purely civilian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The enrichment process is considered essential for obtaining fuel for nuclear stations, but it can also be used to manufacture nuclear weapon materials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It is expected that the International Atomic Energy Agency reconvenes a meeting on March 6th to determine whether Iran has complied with its demands and most likely to decide to refer the issue to the International Security Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the meantime, an Iranian delegation will be visiting Moscow on February 20th, as Vaeedi said, to discuss Russia's proposal to enrich the Iranian uranium on its territory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> But this proposal is contingent on the position of the Iranians who are conducting the enrichment process on their territory, which is what the Western countries do not accept. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Ramallah (The West Bank) 2-15 (AFP) - The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization said today, Wednesday, that the Israeli expansion of settlements undermines the chances of achieving peace in the region, affirming its complete commitment to all agreements signed with the government of Israel under international sponsorship. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The statement of the executive committee at the conclusion of today's meeting at the presidential headquarters in Ramallah under the Chairmanship of the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas, a copy of which was obtained by Agence France Presse, said "The Executive Committee discussed the settlement onslaught that is targeting the Al-Aghwar region in an Israeli attempt at isolating this region from the rest of the Palestinian territories in the West Bank under obvious security and expansionist pretexts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It affirmed "its categorical rejection of these settlement plans that tear our Palestinian land into isolated cantons to prevent our people from establishing their independent state." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The statement added, "And the Executive Committee addressed itself to the Quartet committee that issued the roadmap to declare its position toward this rampant settlement over our land and the necessity for it to play its role which it assumes regarding the peace process and the solution of (establishing) the two states." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It continued that "the continuation of settlement in Holy Jerusalem, the racist wall of separation, the isolation of the Al-Aghwar region in an attempt at its Judaization, and the crimes of assassinations, invasions and arrests, they destroy any opportunity for achieving a just and permanent peace in the Middle East." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added, "It was decided to hold a meeting of the High Committee under the Chairmanship of Salim Al-Zaanoun (Abul-Adib), Speaker of the National Council, in the city of Ramallah during this week to discuss the ongoing preparations for convening the Palestinian Central Council and to approve plans and decisions which are being prepared by the High Committee to activate the Organization, the Executive Committee and the specialized departments." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The statement said that the Committee "discussed the next meeting of the Palestinian Legislative Council scheduled for Saturday," confirming "the complete adherence to the national principles that were approved by the successive Palestinian national councils, and also the commitment to the political program of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Declaration of Independence of 1988." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> It affirmed "the complete commitment to all political agreements that were signed with the government of Israel under international sponsorship, and also the adherence to the resolutions of international legitimacy pertaining to the Palestinian cause, especially resolution 194 which deals with the right of return of the Palestinian refugees and the decisions of the Arab Summit in Beirut." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The statement noted that "all Palestinian institutions must exercise their political and national roles, foremost of which are the legislative and executive institutions, in protecting the national gains, the international recognition of the Organization, the Authority, and the highest interests of our people." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> Saleh Ra'fat, member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement to Agence France Presse, "The Committee has decided to begin a broad diplomatic campaign at both the Arab and international levels, including the Security Council, the Quartet Committee and the contracting States in the Geneva Agreements in order to confront the Israeli policy aiming at annexing the settlement blocks and Al-Aghwar region and at a unilateral delineation of the borders." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> And she added, "You are right, we concentrated our efforts on consolidating the capabilities to provide those services," and not on the hauling and purification grids of local water. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Strange Laws Gives Peculiarity to England </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Jalal Malti </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London 2-17 (AFP) - England has a set of old laws and customs, some of which are strange and some are funny, that are still in force though not enforced, but which certainly amuse law students with their peculiarity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> One of these laws is a law from 1279 which states that "It is not permissible for Members of Parliament to wear a shield" inside Parliament, and the purpose of this law was to prevent fights and quarrels leading to killing between Lords in a country with deep-rooted democratic traditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> And among these strange laws is also a law that prohibits Members of Parliament from dying inside Westminster Castle and that, if happens, the body must be transferred outside Parliament before a death certificate is issued. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Nigel Cawthorne, author of a book entitled, "The Strange Laws of Old England," that reviews these amazing texts which time has bypassed, explains that that law is attributed to the fact that "Westminster Castle is a royal castle and anyone who dies in a royal castle is entitled to an official funeral." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Also, Members of Parliament have the right to gamble and drink alcohol freely in Westminster, including at the library, whereas their compatriots suffer a fine for the similar behavior according to the Library Trespasses Act (1898). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> There are still in England more than 4,000 national laws, 11,000 local laws, 13,000 special laws that date back to before 1801 and which are still in force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Cawthorne told Agence France Presse that "the tradition of law is very important" in England, explaining that "things change, but very slowly and (the laws) are added to each other." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The fact is that Members of Parliament legislated in many facets of everyday life, including the very ordinary aspects of it, and in the 19th century at the height of the industrial revolution they issued a number laws with the objective of regulating life in the suburbs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This eagerness led, for example, to the prohibition of hanging laundry in the streets or singing lewd songs, shooting with a firearm without justification, starting a fire in the park, playing with paper planes, skating on ice, bothering residents by knocking on their doors without justification, lighting public lights "willfully and illegally," and other laws that are laughable in our day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some of these laws have not been enforced for a long time because of the progress that occurred since they were issued, and one of the most peculiar ones is a law that prohibits riding a horse or a cow or riding a steam automobile in a state of drunkenness (1872). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> And a law dating back to 1867 prohibits anyone "living at a distance of less than a mile from a weapons or explosives depot" from acquiring a paper doll, while a law issued in 1839 stipulates a punishment for anyone firing a canon near a house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Kevin Martin, the President of the Legal Society mandated with suggesting laws that ought to be eliminated, said that "these unusual examples represent the old history of the tradition of the law in this country, and they confirm the continuous need to renew the law and adapt it to reality." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> More than 2,000 texts of law have been eliminated since 1965 in a large operation to modernize the laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, British Members of Parliament insist on issuing strange laws such as the "Outer Space Law" (1986) which prohibits any British citizen from "throwing a body in space" without official permission, defining space as including "the moon and all the celestial bodies." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> And wisdom has dictated on them to authorize judges to issue orders "for the use of a reasonable amount of force" to repeal a possible invasion by space beings. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Baghdad 2-17 (AFP) - Three days after the passing of Valentine's Day , a Sunni Imam launched in his Friday sermon an attack on Valentine's Day and those who celebrate it in Iraq, charging that it "takes the youth out of virtue and into vice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Most Imams of the mosques in Iraq focused today, Friday, in their sermons on the photos of abuse of detainees which date back to 2004, whereas some others concentrated on the poor services and the security situation difficulties in the country. However, Sheikh Mahmoud Al-Sumaidiee, Imam of the Umm Al-Qura Mosque, focused on Valentine's Day, which is celebrated worldwide on the 14th of this month, and considered that it has no relation to Islam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He said, "The international Valentine's Day passed two or three days ago, and unfortunately, many of our young men and women do on that day what delights our enemy. They exchange gifts and exchange words, and it has reached the point of exchanging kisses. This is what our enemies want for us, that we live far away from virtue." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Valentine's Day is a very popular day in Iraq, as it is in the other countries of the world. Young men exchange with their girlfriends sweets, flowers, perfumes and other gifts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Al-Sumaidiee added that "Every invasion has objectives, and the invasion of our country wants to trap our youth and take them out of virtue and into vice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The history of the celebration of this occasion in Iraq goes back to before the American invasion in 2003. There was a big celebration that was held on the occasion during the era of the regime of deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and official television used to present special programs for the occasion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It is noteworthy that the son of the Iraqi President Uday was known to hold huge parties on the occasion of Valentine's Day in the halls of the Hunting Club in the upscale Al-Mansour neighborhood, and they lasted until the early morning hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Al-Sumaidiee said that "International Valentine's Day is not looked at well by Islam, and Moslems ought to live with their religion." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Rome 2-17 (AFP) - The Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi signed today, Friday, seven weeks before the legislative elections, a political agreement with the neo-Fascist Movement "Social Alternative" that is headed by Alessandra Mussolini, the grand-daughter of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Berlusconi announced in the presence of Mussolini, "We have reached an agreement on the program between 'House of Freedoms' (the ruling coalition) and the Social Alternative", thus expanding his electoral alliance to the radical right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The alliance with Social Alternative, in preparation for the voting operation scheduled for the ninth and tenth of April, provoked the anger of the rest of Berlusconi's allies because of the presence of controversial personalities affiliated with the neo-Fascist radical right in this formation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Berlusconi asserted, "Our family photo album is ideal, it is snow-white." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A solution was reached when Mussolini and her two uncomfortable allies, Roberto Fiori, leader of Forza Nuova (New Force) and Adriano Tilgher, leader of the National Social Front, decided on Thursday not to personally run as candidates on the lists of the House of Freedoms coalition and suggested other candidacies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Massimo Dalema, leader of the Leftist Democrats (the largest opposition party), said today, Friday, "that it is a very dangerous thing that Berlusconi signs agreements with the neo-Fascist radical right." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Ignazio La Russa, leader of the Members of Parliament of the National Alliance (right-wing conservative, originating from the movement that succeeded Fascism), the second party in Berlusconi's coalition, emphasized that in spite of the withdrawal of the leaders of Social Alternative from candidacy, "the fundamental problem continues to consist of sharing basic values and the political program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Mussolini's party calls for rejecting Turkey's joining the European Union, rejecting European arrest warrants and abortion laws, and it calls for deporting immigrants and signing a new treaty with the Catholic Church, and it denounces "American imperialism." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Brussels 2-17 (AFP) - A new study conducted by Belgian researchers and entitled "Progress of Terrorism in 2005" reports that Moslems are the primary victims of the terrorism that is carried out in the name of Islam, and that international terrorism strikes the Middle East more than it strikes the West. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On the other hand, the study noted that 90% of victims of international terrorism in 2005 died in Iraq and Jordan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This study was conducted under the Chairmanship of Rick Kohlsaat, Professor of International Relations at the University of Ghent in Western Belgium and was published on the government's "Economie" site on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to the study, the number of international terrorism operations has dropped greatly in 2005 compared with 2004, as there were 266 attacks that killed 443 victims in 2004, compared to 393 attacks that killed 733 victims in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The study considered that terrorism is not a danger of a global nature, because it is primarily concentrated in one region which is the Middle East. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In contrast, "local" terrorism, that is the one perpetrated by the subjects of a state against targets in their own country witnessed a large increase between 2004 and 2005, since the number of attacks rose by 90% while the number of victims rose by 60%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The study concluded that this increase is almost completely the result of the situation in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It also said that "the conflict in Iraq, which was presented as an element in the war on terrorism, contributed to making Iraq today a center of terrorism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Rick Kohlsaat, relying on these numbers, said in a telephone communication with him, "Imagine how the Islamic world looks at these numbers, when the Western party insists on saying that it is the one threatened" by terrorism. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study uncovered that "the notion that says that international terrorism represents a fundamental external threat is not supported by the facts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In the same context, Kohlsaat said that "Jihadist terrorism does not represent this existential threat that we believe it is, even if it represents a challenge to our society." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Berlusconi Faces Difficulty in Dismissing Minister Accused of Insulting Islam </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Christian Spielmann </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rome 2-18 (AFP) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi today, Saturday, waged a battle with his allies of the Northern League in order to dismiss one of their leaders, who is the Reforms Minister Roberto Calderoli, with the goal of calming the tension in the Islamic world caused by his statements that are injurious to Islam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Prime Minister asked Calderoli to resign, stressing at the same time today, Saturday, that he "has no authority to force him" to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Minister concerned replied saying he is ready to resign in "case (Umberto) Bossi (leader of the Northern League) asks me to do that and in case the Islamic world undertakes an initiative of pacification." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Italian Minister is accused of insulting Islam by wearing a cotton shirt bearing the caricature cartoons that are insulting to the Prophet Mohammad which caused a serious international crisis. He was wearing the cotton shirt on Thursday and he appeared wearing it during the evening newscast on the Italian Channel One "RAI." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This initiative by him and other new accusations against Islam he made in press statements on Friday led to violent anti-Italian demonstrations in Libya in which ten people were killed on Friday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Roberto Calderoli does not intend to apologize. The newspaper "Corriere Della Sera" quoted him today, Saturday, as saying, "I don't feel responsible for those deaths." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In his statement to the newspaper "La Republica," he emphasized that "Western culture is the one threatened." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Silvio Berlusconi had caused a shock in the Islamic world  when he asserted "the superiority of Western culture" on September 26, 2001, two weeks after the attacks on the United States. He faced great difficulties to repair the repercussions from those statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Calderoli (49 years old), who is a former physician specializing in - maxillofacial surgery, is considered one of the radicals in the Northern League, the movement that is anti-foreigners and is allied with Berlusconi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He joined the government in July 2004 to replace Bossi, the Leader of the League who was forced to resign after he suffered a heart attack. The League assumes three ministries, which are Justice, Labor and Reforms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Roberto Calderoli affirms that he has the support of Umberto Bossi and his party, in addition to "the support of the many Italians who think like me." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He said, bragging to La Republica newspaper, "Silvio Berlusconi asked for my resignation, but I have not resigned yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Italian authorities fear new demonstrations today, Saturday, against Italy in the Islamic world, in addition to reactions in Italy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Berlusconi announced that he has asked the Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisano to ensure the surveillance of the offices of the Northern League, and he confirmed that "All protection measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Italian missions abroad." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> As for the Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini, he declared his determination to visit the Rome Mosque today, Saturday, in an attempt to calm the tension that was stirred by Calderoli's statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> This is not the time that the Prime Minister is in a confrontation with the Northern League over the demand for the resignation of one of its Ministers from the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In July 2003, he had to negotiate with Umberto Bossi to dismiss the Deputy Minister of Tourism Stefano Stefani who made statements that were offensive to German tourists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The confrontation lasted one week and caused a crisis in the diplomatic relations with Germany that was already upset at the insults directed by Silvio Berlusconi personally to a German Representative, whom he compared to a Nazi concentration camp guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> This new crisis comes at a critical phase for the Prime Minister who is immersed in a difficult campaign as part of the legislative elections scheduled for the ninth and tenth of April. Maurizio Gaspari, one of the leaders of the National Coalition (right) said that the crisis "came at a time we had begun to improve our position according to the opinion polls." </seg>

<seg id="1"> With the News: Solana Between His Mind and His Heart, By Nureddine Ashoor </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The tour taken currently by the Foreign Policy Coordinator of the European Union, Javier Solana, does not pose the question of the possibilities of its success as much as it begs the question of whether he appealed to his mind or to his heart when he volunteered to try and calm the mind of the Islamic public opinion in the aftermath of the publication by many European newspapers of the cartoons that are offensive to the Messenger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> And since Solana is currently present in the Middle East, it seems that he appealed to his heart after he was offended by the publication of the cartoons and he felt what Moslems feel as a result of the insult that they received in the name of freedom of expression, since he did not hesitate to declare that "In the European Union, we have deep respect for Moslems.. </seg>
<seg id="4"> and we never wanted to hurt their feelings.." </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is some of what the European official said after his recent meeting with the Secretary General of the Islamic Conference Organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And if the Coordinator of European Foreign Policy had chosen (and that is simply an assumption) to listen to his mind, he would have spared himself the hardship of going to the Middle East, either to apologize or to "convince," and the crisis would have been resolved in a European context since Denmark is a member of the European Union and its economic interests are threatened with harm.. </seg>
<seg id="7"> So is it reasonable that a certain party hurries to the one unjustly treated to calm him and soothe him before condemning the oppressor and making him understand that what he did is rejected? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Was Hitler left alone during World War II, free and unencumbered to implement his aggressive plans and his racist ideas so the Allies would be content with consoling the European peoples, including the Jews? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The most dangerous thing in this issue is that there are attempts to convince Moslems of the soundness of the European conduct which still has not eliminated the pretext of freedom of expression in the context of the publication of the cartoons, for this does not solve the crisis. There are some who paid the price of their lives in protesting the cartoons, and as such Europe would have succeeded in achieving two things. The first is to dilute the issue and keep it in the context of freedom of publication, and the second is to export the crisis to Islamic countries where it would be reduced to a situation of chaos and violence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason, the mere transformation of Solana to a man of good offices towards the Islamic world shows that the European Union did not comprehend the feelings of Moslems who do not deny the freedom of expression, but they don't want it to be a tool to incite hatred and violate religious feelings... </seg>
<seg id="11"> When we hear about the issuance of a European, then an international law that criminalizes attacks against religions and harming the sacred, then Solana's efforts will truly be praiseworthy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Lakhdar Ibrahimi and the Mandela of Iraq, by Assia Al-Atrous </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Because acknowledging failure and admitting defeat never did find their way easily into the lexicon of international diplomacy in general, and Arab diplomacy in particular, especially when the matter relates to the war on Iraq or the events, circumstances, and mysteries that surrounded it and surround it, which may not be exposed for a long time, the words that came out of the mouth of the cunning Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Ibrahimi about his impossible mission in Iraq cannot pass without drawing attention or giving pause for thought. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> And because Lakhdar Ibrahimi was practically the only Arab and Maghrebi diplomat who accepted to enter into the adventure up close and carry out a mission that was not free of danger, either personally or as a journey, by going to an Arab country after it had been occupied and destroyed, it is therefore very natural, in the midst of the dangerous developments the Iraqi scene experienced over the past two and a half years, that his mission would arouse a great deal of debate about the causes and the motives that could induce a man of Ibrahimi's stature and experience to accept being involved in a role under the direction of the American occupation, since he had been very clear in his positions from the start, and since he had no qualms admitting that the decision for war was made outside the framework of international legitimacy. Lakhdar Ibrahimi had previously linked the success of his mission in South Africa during the Apartheid to the existence of a leader like Mandela who was able to establish the Committee for Truth and Reconciliation and rally his people around him, it seemed virtually impossible a few years ago to achieve a dream that was... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> And without doubt, when Ibrahimi, the former advisor to the Secretary General of the United Nations, and who embodies a journey that cannot be underestimated in various areas of diplomatic work and efforts exerted in many crises in the developing world, returns and admits the failure of his mission, and determines the causes and the kinds of mistakes which he fell into, besides all kinds of convulsions and fatal deception, he has thereby removed the mantle of the stubborn and tenacious diplomat who knows he is wrong but refuses to admit it and insists on proceeding on the wrong track because his pride and sense of honor prevent him from doing so, in spite of his conviction about what the consequences and risks could be to him... </seg>
<seg id="5"> . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In an interview he gave to one of the Arab newspapers, Ibrahimi admitted his failure in his mission in Iraq, which he described as impossible in light of all kinds of vetoes he faced during the discharge of his mission. Ibrahimi, who used to and continues to bear the title of the man for difficult missions, did not deny feeling embarrassed for accepting to participate in working with the occupation authorities in Iraq and under those thorny circumstances, considering at the same time that what motivated him to accept this mission was the assurance of the American Administration that it seeks to end the occupation as soon as possible, which was not true after it became clear that all that mattered to the American Administration was not to search for a solution to the present situation in Iraq as much as it was to search for a solution to the problem it created for itself in Iraq, particularly with regard to the American public opinion that had realized that the reasons used by the  White House Administration to justify the war were fictitious and based on false reports... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Perhaps the reasons that drove Ibrahimi to acknowledge his failure do not stop at one specific reason, but they remain linked to a series of reasons, the most important of which is that he realized that the occupation was bringing resistance and resistance was bringing repression, torture and secret prisons, and that it is impossible in any case for the military option to be the required solution in Iraq... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Ibrahimi's confessions reflected a present reality in Iraq for the past several months, not in the amount of material losses and the impact of demolition and destruction, but more importantly in the amount of human losses, the psychological wounds, alienation and displacement, while the absence of a national figure that is influential and capable of gathering the ranks of Iraqis and unifying them remains a critical factor in helping to get out of the present situation and overcome the various challenges of the coming phase.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it then possible, after the long suffering of Iraqis, to reconsider the faulty policy in Iraq in order to salvage what can be salvaged and give Iraqis an opportunity to recover their sovereignty, far from any kind of custodianship and solutions imported in the cans of democracy. </seg>

<seg id="11"> The adherents of the position that is against the democratization of the Arab Islamic region link the victory of Hamas and the electoral gains garnered by the extremist wing in the elections of Iran with the victory of the candidates of the Moslem Brotherhood organization with five seats in Parliament for the first time in Egypt.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Security and military alliance </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the Financial Times and many European and American sources, "in spite of the criticisms directed by the administration at the Egyptian regime because of its violations of the law during the latest legislative elections," the American budget of 2007 anticipates an increase in the volume of military and security assistance that Washington provides to Cairo since it is "an important ally in the war on terrorism.." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Alliance of Hamas with Washington's opponents </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> This debate that will continue in the European and American media is intensified by many issues, of which: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> * The support by some countries which Washington and some European capitals consider to be major opponents, to Hamas (and its upcoming government), particularly Syria, Iran, Sudan, Russia and Venezuela, and the list could extend to include other countries such as Cuba, Korea, China and several Arab and Islamic countries.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> * The objective alliance between Tehran, Moscow, Beijing and many of the countries of Europe and the Asian countries against the option of a siege of Iran because of the Iranian nuclear issue.. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Tehran's foreign policy after the victory of Ahmadinejad and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement under the leadership of Mohammad Khatami and his former Minister of Education Mahajerani.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> * The failure of the majority of Washington's liberal and secular allies in Iraqi elections.. </seg>
<seg id="21"> and the centering of the conflict in the elections, the political game and the security battles between Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish movements, parties and groups that have many contradictions, the vast majority of which have a religious character. </seg>
<seg id="22"> ..and do not distinguish between religion and politics </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> * The persistence of the security unrest and the waves of suicide attacks against American and Allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan (thousands of dead and wounded Americans in 2005 alone), and against Israeli targets in occupied Palestine.. </seg>
<seg id="24"> in spite of the projects in support of reform and democracy that have been adopted by the administration of President Bush for years.. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Which means that those projects have not yet helped to improve the general opinion among the people and the radical movements in "the Greater Middle East" of Washington and its policies in the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The resolutions of the Georgia and Istanbul summits </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It may be premature to expect a final retreat by Washington from its great project - which was adopted by the Group of Eight also at the Georgia Summit and the Atlantic Alliance in Istanbul in 2004 - and which aims at repeating the Eastern European scenario in the Arab Islamic world.. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But many indicators show a great hesitation by American and European decision makers to continue supporting the "democratic reform" project.. </seg>

<seg id="1"> On Controlling Energy and Supporting New Energy: Producing Electricity from Nuclear Energy is One of the Most Critical Energy Solutions for the Medium- and Long-Term. Investigating Possible Solutions to Confront External Attacks on the Electricity and Gas Grid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunis - Al-Sabah. Mr. Othman Ben Arfa, Chief Executive Officer of the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company, said that our country needs for the medium- and long-term, i.e. during the next two decades, to generate and produce electricity by investing in nuclear energy, which is considered one of the best alternative energy solutions that is not </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> expensive and available at the present time in light of the rising cost of fuel in the world. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And the Chief Executive Officer of the STEG reported at the occasion of his presentation of a review of the company's strategy in the area of providing the energy needed by the country for the benefit of the members of the Economic and Finance Committee of the Parliament, in the presence of representatives from the National Agency for Energy Control yesterday at its headquarters in the capital, that there will be soon and at the highest level an investigation of the possible solutions to confront with determination the problem of the repeated external attacks on the electric and gas grid of the company, which is costing annual losses estimated in the millions of dinars and which represents 50% of the electricity breakdowns in Greater Tunis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Mr. Othman Ben Arfa presented at this meeting, that was attended by Mr. Izzedine Khalafallah, Executive Director of the National Energy Agency, the future programs of the STEG in the field of producing electric and gas energy, in addition to addressing many issues related to services offered to businesses. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the course of his discussion about the possibilities that will be available in the future in the area of alternative energies, and in addition to more work for exploiting solar energy and wind energy, that nuclear energy is considered the most important alternative energy that can be exploited for the purpose of producing electricity, especially considering that the Tunisian electric grid is capable of absorbing and transporting the enormous electric power that nuclear energy can produce. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In that same vein, he clarified that Tunisia had presented its request on the subject of exploiting nuclear energy in peaceful fields to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency during his visit at an earlier time to our country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The review of the company's future programs stated that the STEG was able during 2005 to save an overall energy of 156,600 ton-equivalents of oil, or what amounts to 29 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="9"> During the next phase, work will be done to provide new regions with the natural gas grid and link 50,000 new subscribers to the grid as part of a program spanning from 2005 and 2009 to bring the number of subscribers to the grid to 400,000 subscribers, which will preempt a subsidy by the State of about 92 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The company in the future will also shrink its imports of gas bottles by expanding the Gabes plant for producing and converting gas, which will enable an annual profit close to 15 million dinars, and improve quality and billing services by relying on the most modern technological methods such as the Internet and the technique of a monthly deduction in the amount of the consumption for which there are currently 70,000 subscribers or by using pre-paid cards that may be adopted more widely in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Saving 1.25 million ton equivalents of oil </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As to the review that was presented by the Executive Director of the National Agency for Energy Control, its highlights included presenting the contents of the three-year program for energy control 2005-2008 through which will be achieved an overall savings of energy of about 1.25 million ton-equivalents of oil, and avoiding a state subsidy of a value of 220 million dinars, in exchange for a credit appropriation estimated at 70 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Concerning heating water with solar energy, 22,000 square meters were installed, five suppliers in the sector and 237 installation companies were approved, which will enable the achievement of overall savings close to 1,600 ton-equivalents of oil annually and avoid an annual state subsidy of 516,000 dinars. </seg>
<seg id="14"> During the same period, 84 institutions were connected to natural gas, which will enable an overall substitution close to 100,000 ton-equivalents of oil annually of subsidized petroleum substances and avoid an annual state subsidy close to 7.6 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> By 2008, 220,000 residences are scheduled to be connected to the natural gas grid, and disseminate the usage of energy-saving equipment by installing approximately 8,000 pressure controls in the old lighting grids, which will enable to save energy at 30% of the cost of the annual consumption of municipalities, which is equivalent to seven million dinars annually. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Disseminating energy control programs to all household electrical appliances beginning with freezers, such that the promotion of those with the highest energy consumption will be banned gradually from category eight and seven, then six and five. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regarding the exploitation of wind energy, 160 megawatts will be installed throughout the STEG by expanding in the first phase the wind station in Sidi Daoud. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In the area of scientific research, eight contract research projects have been developed in the area of energy control with the participation of 20 laboratories, 12 institutions and 200 researchers from various scientific research institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Energy saving light bulb month </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Within the same program, three million energy-saving light bulbs will be installed between 2005 and 2008, which will enable a savings in energy of 136,000 ton-equivalent of oil and avoid a subsidy of 12 million dinars. So far, an international call for bids has been sent for the acquisition of two million light bulbs, with the possibility of furnishing the market with local manufacturing by about 400,000 bulbs monthly at a price not exceeding 4,500 Millimes per bulb. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As to developments in awareness and sensitivity, the organizing of the month of energy-saving bulbs was launched from ten to the tenth of next March, consisting in a multimedia advertisement campaign that promotes energy-saving light bulbs made locally, and adopting a unified retail sales price at the large department stores ranging between 2,860 Millimes and 4,445 Millimes based on the brand. It is expected that 400,000 bulbs will be provided during the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="22"> During the current year, television, radio, press and field campaigns will be ongoing, besides organizing six retail panels in cooperation with the relevant ministries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It is noted that the meeting included ample discussion among committee members and officials at the STEG and the National Energy Control Agency. This was an opportunity for Members of Parliament to put forward some inquiries and suggestions, and several of them expressed their admiration for what was presented by both bodies in terms of the significant data covering the future programs in the area of energy control. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Particularly, the STEG has experienced progress at all levels, which made it a pioneer and a star at the national and international levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> It is also of note in the same context that 43 branches of the STEG that are located throughout all the regions of the Republic will soon receive the international certification of quality. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The Food Trade Balance This Year : Towards Achieving a 197 Million Dollar Surplus </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunis - Al-Sabah. Early expectations for the food trade balance during 2005 indicate that the value of exports will grow by 15.6% to 1,187 million dinars compared to 1,027 million dinars achieved in 2005, according to the economic trade for farming and fishing for 2006, which will achieve a surplus of 197 million dinars so exports will exceed imports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This improvement is fundamentally attributed to the growth anticipated for olive oil exports which are expected to amount to close to 600 million dinars this year versus 476 million dinars during the elapsed year, or an increase of 26%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As for the rest of the products, it is expected that their revenues compared with the previous year will achieve an increase ranging between 13% for citrus fruits since the French market absorbs the majority of the quantities exported, or 99.8%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the same context, 241 tons of citrus fruits were exported for the first time last year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is in addition to the positive development that the dates sector will witness at a rate of 4.4% this current year, although exports of dates during the past year approached 45,000 tons for a value of 114 million dinars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It is also expected during the current year that exports of seafood will increase by 2.9% to 18,500 tons. It is noteworthy that 18,000 tons of sea products, valued at 175 million dinars, were exported in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> As to imports, it is expected that the current year will see stability in their overall value at about 990 million dinars, which is the same level of 2005 approximately bordering around 992 million dinars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is expected that the value of cereal imports will register growth in value at a rate of 13% to 439 million dinars compared to 338 million dinars last year. This is attributed to a reduction in production in this area to 1.8 million tons after it was recorded the previous year at a level of 2.1 million tons according to the trade balance, while imports of other products will register a decline, according to the same source. </seg>

<seg id="1"> And the talk about the existence of Al-Qaeda groups in Lebanon is linked to the arrest by the Lebanese Security Services of a number of people who believe in that orientation and who formed groups on the ground, some of which, the investigations have shown, were preparing for military actions. </seg>
<seg id="2"> But the most important point in this case is the information that continues to be reiterated about the link between a group that was arrested in Beirut and the assassination of the martyr President Rafik Hariri. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Two fundamentalist groups that are considered likely to be affiliated with the Al-Qaeda organization are currently in the custody of the Security Services and the Lebanese judiciary system, and investigations are ongoing on members of those two groups %pw ((-)). </seg>
<seg id="4"> The first group is composed of five people, four Lebanese and one Syrian known as Abu-Qatada, and they were arrested in the town of ((Bir'aya)) in the north. Information indicates that these were present in Iraq and were imprisoned by the American Forces for about six months. One of them had a leg amputated as a result of a mine explosion. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The second group was arrested in Beirut and is composed of 13 people of various Arab nationalities who possessed weapons, counterfeit travel documents, and called each other by fake names. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And according to security sources, they are </seg>
<seg id="7"> One, the leader of the group, Hassan Mohammad Nabaa, had participated in the events of ((Deniyyeh)) in 2000 and escaped to Syria. His two brothers participated in the demonstration on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two, Amer Abdallah Hallaq, a Palestinian mechanical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Three, Hani Hashem Al-Shanti, naturalized of Palestinian origin, and he is a computer engineer. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Four, Hamad Turki ((Al-Rubaa)), a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Five, Mohammad Abdel Razzaq Wafa'I, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Six, Faysal Assaad Akbar, a Saudi national who entered Lebanon with a fake passport under the name of Fahd Mohammad Al-Khadem Al-Yamani. He fought in the ranks of Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, then moved to Syria. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Seven, Mohammad Ahmad Kawja, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Eight, Tareq Al-Nasser, a Syrian neurosurgeon who accompanied some of those men to Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Nine, Ali Jihad Sharafeddin, a Lebanese minor whose task is to transport explosives. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ten, Khodr Mohammad Nabaa, a Lebanese. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Twelve, Bara' Mohammad Fouad, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Thirteen, Muaath Abdel Ghani Shusha, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The information says that all of these are connected to one Syrian person from Homs known as Jamil, and he is an expert in electronics engineering, explosives and booby-trapping. He supplied the fighters going to Iraq with weapons and money, and the information also revealed the two most dangerous members of this group, Khaled Taha and Bilal Zaaroura, entered Lebanon from Syria last December, and they are likely located in the Ain Al-Helwe camp. They were never arrested. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A lot of information is woven around the investigation on members of this group about their involvement in the assassination of President Rafik Hariri. The international inquiry commission and the American side have requested to examine this information which may come from a highly placed judiciary authority. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Members of this group remain in the custody of the Information Branch at the Internal Security Forces, that accompany them to the Military Investigative Judge to continue investigating them for the crime of planning to carry out terrorist operations. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, the manner with which this file is being handled suggests as though there is internal information pertaining to the assassination, but the judiciary sources do not confirm this information because they do not have material evidence, and they say that the issue is political talk aimed at shifting the accusation from one place to another. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Hezbollah, which %pw declined to participate in a demonstration Sunday, benefited from the scene of unrest and disturbances to present today a contrasting image with a packed and organized crowd in the hundreds of thousands. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And in addition to this point of organization and order, the Secretary General of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah forged ahead, leaning on the momentum of the Mar Mikhail's meeting with General Aoun, in a political assault on those he described as the current custodians of power, calling on them to admit to the facts produced by the recent developments and accusing some of those who manage the State to contributing to the straining of the political and sectarian atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nasrallah, who feels a renewed political security, proclaimed a program of priorities for the coming phase, in which most importantly is a call to those who want to wage war with Syria or against Syria to benefit from his party or his faction or his group. But it is not permissible, according to Nasrallah, to drag the government and the State and its institutions into a war of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In contrast, and hours after the political and popular show of force by Hezbollah, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora sought to continue cleaning up the aftermath of last Sunday by convening a religious summit that is being held at this moment in the Grand Serail. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For more information, we have a direct correspondence from that location with colleague Denise Rahme-Fakhry. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Denise, good evening. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Good evening, George. </seg>

<seg id="11"> Also participating is Patriarch Nerses Bedros XIX, Patriarch of the Armenian Catholics, and Dr. Salim Sahyouni, President of the Supreme Council of the Evangelical Denomination in Syria and Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also participating are Bishop Elias Audi, Bishop Boulos Matar, Bishop Kegham Khatcherian, and also Bishop Roland Abou Jaoudeh. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The Saint Maroun Church in Gemmayzeh, which was subject to acts of disturbance last Sunday, commemorated today the Feast of Saint Maroun Day with an official celebratory mass that gathered the Lebanese parties led by the two Presidents Emile Lahoud and Fouad Siniora, and a representative of President Berri. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The celebration of Saint Maroun Day returns this year while Lebanon is going through difficult circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Feast gathered at the Saint Maroun Church in Gemmayzeh all of the spiritual families of Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The President of the Republic General Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, and Abdel Latif Zein, representing the Speaker of Parliament, all attended the event.. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Also participating in the Holy Eucharist was a large number of ministers, members of parliament, and political, union, social, media and spiritual figures, and the ambassadors of the foreign powers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Presiding over the divine Eucharist was Bishop Boulos Matar who said that the tradition of gathering to pray at the Saint Maroun Church in Beirut goes back three-quarters of a century, and its persistence is but a sign that the Lebanese, in spite of their differences, are bound to each other by love. </seg>
<seg id="7"> What is required today is not to defame others with treason or unconstructive attacks. Rather, what is required is love. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The security we lost in our capital for hours, and the feeling people had of being without a roof to protect their necks, their livelihood and what they hold as sacred, has sharply question what we have been trying to prove for 30 years, during which we almost lost everything, we shed abundant blood and tears in the hope that a bright tomorrow will dawn on us and our generations in a safe, stable and completely sovereign country and in a capable and just State. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So is it reasonable that we have to wait longer after all that? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Bishop Matar stressed the need for continued dialogue in consultation with people and across the multiplicity of opinions in search for the best solutions as seen by the majority of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the majority does not bring people together on the basis of their religious affiliations or the like, but rather on the basis of their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And it is transferred by handing power from one side to another without difficulty to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The game of free minds and hearts, and free wills, increases in value whenever the group increases its rationality and the practice of its freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And undoubtedly, it is the soundest basis to identify the welfare of the group because it brings everyone into the search and the decision. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It also prescribes on the majority, any majority, to take into consideration the opinion of the minority and the integration of both prior to any disagreement. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Prayers were held at the occasion in order to lay the foundation for love in Lebanon and peace in its regions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And in ((Bkerki)) the Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Sfeir stressed in his holiday sermon the need for solidarity in these tough oppressive days in Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We celebrate today the Feast of Saint Maroun, the father of our Maronite Church, and the best way to celebrate the saints is to follow the example of their lives. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The words of the Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir. </seg>
<seg id="20"> During his presiding of the celebratory mass at the Church of the Patriarchal Seat at the occasion of the celebration of the Feast of Saint Maroun, it was an occasion to recall the life of Saint Maroun which was characterized by giving, prayer, asceticism and the struggle against the temptations of the world and its sins. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Cardinal Sfeir called the Lebanese to show solidarity in these tough oppressive days. </seg>
<seg id="22"> As we express our strong regrets for what happened last Sunday in the capital Beirut in terms of destruction, demolition and violations, which were sought to ignite the fire of strife, we praise God that the citizens in their awareness knew how to avoid its evil. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We congratulate our brothers and sons the Maronites for this Feast, here at home and in their lands of emigration, near and far, and we call on all of them to emulate the virtues of this saint, especially for his distinct fear of God, his detachment from the sins of the world and his love of people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And he always said, in the presence of the Almighty, we are useless slaves, Amen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> After the celebratory mass for the Feast of Saint Maroun, the faithful and the well-wishers moved to the Patriarchal Seat where Cardinal Sfeir welcomed the representative of the French Ambassador, Francois Abi Saad, the former Member of Parliament Estephan Al-Doueihi, in addition to a delegation from the Lebanese Forces from Ghadir. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Also speaking was the Secretary of a delegation of Maronite Clergy graduates in Ghadir. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The circumstances are very difficult, and what is being schemed against this nation has become known, and there are some who do not want tranquility for its sons. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But we should close our ranks together and know that there is strength in unity and weakness in partisanship. </seg>

<seg id="2"> %pw Geagea, and in front of ((partisans)) of the Lebanese Forces in the region of Aley, announced the continuation of work for the sake of reaching a consensual candidate in replacement of the late Member of Parliament Edmond ((Eid.)) </seg>
<seg id="3"> Dr. Samir Geagea confirmed the continued consultation and search of a consensual candidate to avoid an election battle in Baabda-Aley. </seg>
<seg id="4"> ((The address)) of the president of the Executive Committee of the Lebanese Forces came during a meeting that gathered the cadres in the Aley region as part of the periodic preparatory meetings to restructure the Lebanese Forces Party. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We are at the present time engaged in a very serious attempt to arrive at a candidate to avoid an election battle, even though it would be a democratic battle, and arrive at a candidate who satisfies all the parties. </seg>
<seg id="6"> ((Your received it)) Now, a candidate who satisfies all the concerned parties, and of course we respect all the concerned parties, particularly the Free Patriotic Movement, a consensual candidate requires that we sit in a closed room and discuss all the proposed and the non-proposed names. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The proposed and the non-proposed, so we both arrive, with what we represent, we will arrive at a name that is acceptable by both parties. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In what concerns us, there would thus be consensus. We sit down, we propose a name or two, three, 15, it could reach ((up to)) 15, 20 maybe, until we get to a name that satisfies us and satisfies the remaining parties who are concerned with the battle. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This is what we are trying to do at the present time, putting all our weight into it, focusing on it in a final way, and we are trying to reach it. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I wanted in all simplicity and in all honesty for you to be informed, but at the same time I reiterate my saying to you, this does not mean that you should not prepare for legislative elections, in case this initiative does not lead to the expected result. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Dr. Geagea also addressed two fundamental issues that are being debated on the political stage today, which include the issue of the economic situation and the need to find and implement an effective solution. And the second issue is the wait-and-see policy and self-control for which the Lebanese Forces are calling after the latest events. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Today we have waged the war with courage, and to the extent that we waged the war with courage, we want to wage peace with courage, and peace requires a much greater courage than the courage for war. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The issue is not always one of machismo as we know it, there are times when self-control and remaining calm require much more courage than putting one's finger on the trigger and firing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> (As anyone can shoot), but not everyone can control themselves ((so as not to shoot)). Some criticize us that we abandon the economic and social situation, and we are doing politics. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The answer is that it is not possible to think of serious economic solutions and serious social solutions outside the framework of an effective and capable State. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because for every solution you think of, you can bring all the experts of the world and they come up with all the solutions for you that one can imagine. But these solutions need someone to implement them, who will implement them, they need an effective State to implement them; we still don't have this effective State. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The president of the Executive Committee of the Lebanese Forces met at his residence in the Cedars with the British Ambassador James Watt for an hour. The British ambassador did not make any statement. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Uh, I apologize - before we continue the newscast, about an error in the introduction to the report about the position of Dr. Samir Geagea who affirmed that the Forces, to the extent that they waged %pw the war with courage, they will wage peace with courage also, this error was the result of an error in the print. </seg>

<seg id="1"> [ ] </seg>
<seg id="2"> The President of the Executive Committee of the Lebanese Forces, Dr. Samir Geagea, talked on the Naharkum Saiid program about what he called a rescue plan to liberate the presidency of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A multifaceted plan because ((what I see in it)) the situation in the country remains, uh, in a state of stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Of course, the position of the President of the Republic is a central position, in contrast (to what many believe). From this perspective, if we were to hope for any improvement of the situation in the country, we have to start from this position. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Now the components of this plan are of course still under study, but its fundamental elements will be constitutional, legal, political and popular. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Ok, and what is its timeframe, I mean is there a specified timeframe for this plan? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not much. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Not much, of course, uh, an initiative of this kind, a plan of this kind, I mean, one cannot estimate when exactly it will be complete, but we can estimate when it can start. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Ok, General Michel Aoun said yesterday that the extension for President Lahoud was forced, likewise the electoral law was forced, do you agree with this comparison? </seg>
<seg id="13"> No, and this, I mean, this comparison is not, is not accurate and is unscientific. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The extension for President Lahoud was forced in the sense that a bunch of intelligence men came ((grabbed members of parliament)), threatened them and told them you have to sign on the extension law, whereas the Electoral Law of 2000 was submitted by parliament, there was a second law proposed, which is Law Number 60, and after a give and take, there was a political compromise. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I repeat again, intelligence men did not come, grabbed members of parliament and told them you have to go and sign on the Law of 2000. No. There was a political compromise from the standpoint of ((the need)) of everyone to hold the elections on time, ok ((here goes the country in a constitutional vacuum.)) </seg>
<seg id="16"> And from the standpoint of, uh, President Berri using his position to pass the Law of 2000 because ((how)) it was convenient for him, the most convenient law that suited him, the parties had to come up with a political compromise, and of course, a political compromise is one thing and the forced extension in the sense of %pw, because of oppression and coercion is another completely different thing. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, the Law of 2000, which we of course do not agree, came from the standpoint of a %pw political compromise that took place then, according to the circumstances that prevailed. </seg>
<seg id="18"> MP Boutros Harb considered that Resolution 1559 puts the President of the Republic in an illegal situation and I find it odd that General Michel Aoun is calling for holding early parliamentary elections. </seg>
<seg id="19"> MP Boutros Harb says that the letter he sent (()) to the President of the Republic General Emile Lahoud at Christmas was interpreted by President Lahoud as though it was in support of him, and since he did not proceed to take the decision to step down, the March 14th Forces had to open the file of the Presidency in a serious manner. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Uh, of course, we hope that the President of the Republic realizes this situation and its danger, and the very negative results for Lebanon if it were to stay in the same situation, %pw and he is the one who would inflict great harm to the presidency, let alone personal harm to him, I mean the president. Because any panel, any panel we see on television is %pw, is %pw, is directing really offensive and insulting words, in addition to that it is the position of the presidency has become an absentee from, absentee, I mean, inexistent in the political life, except in the statements that are issued to respond to this or that. This is of course more harmful to the presidency, uh, and to his negative positions which he sends as responses to the laws that come out of parliament, regardless of whether or not he has the right to respond. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Harb mentioned several ways to deal with the issue of the presidency. There are the two aspects, the constitutional and the legal, and there is the political and the popular action. </seg>
<seg id="22"> ((Sheikh)), can we know what is this constitutional and legal mechanism that you are adopting? Will you adopt what came down in 1559, in the two reports by ((Larsen)) and ((Mehlis))? What will you basically adopt to dismiss the President of the Republic? </seg>
<seg id="23"> 1559 stipulates the obligation of holding free presidential elections in the respect of the provisions of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="24"> What happened with the elections, the second day after the resolution was issued, it is in complete violation %pw %pw of one of the articles of this resolution, and this means that the President of the Republic, internationally, his presence is in violation of 1559, and this is in opposition to the international trend and international legitimacy. This is, of course, a big point for which there could be political interaction with him in a way that leads in the end to put the President of the Republic in an illegal situation towards the international community, and consequently dealing with him will be on that basis, but this is something that has not yet happened. In fact, we were keen that it does not happen, because we thought that we would reach this attempt, and as a result we were keen that the President of the Republic himself took the initiative because the reality in which he is, is not enviable, you know. </seg>
<seg id="25"> ((Sheikh)), but %pw, General Aoun, I mean, who was against the extension and was opposing the President of the Republic, is now opposing the dismissal of the president, and instead of calling for presidential elections, he now is calling for early parliamentary elections. Well, what is your reply to this proposition? </seg>
<seg id="26"> What is %pw the purpose of the elections? </seg>
<seg id="27"> We are going back %pw </seg>
<seg id="28"> I mean, there could come out a composition that is different from the present political composition, such that someone could have more, and another could have less. That is not what is required. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What is required is that we benefit from the international support for ((Lebanon)) and from the resulting national circumstance, which was made clear yesterday on February 14 and this, this patriotic pairing for the first time it is happening in the history of Lebanon ((for the births)) in Lebanon first ((for the births)) in Lebanon the one free sovereign independent, I mean, the history of Lebanon is witnessing a great thing which we should not miss (()). </seg>
<seg id="30"> There are still men in this country. </seg>
<seg id="31"> None of us can pretend to be the only good person and all the other persons are not good. </seg>
<seg id="32"> There are a lot of good people in Lebanon, and there are people with whom we agree and with whom we can reach an understanding. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Our concern is for the interests of Lebanon, any person we can agree on that guarantees the interests of Lebanon, we should all relinquish our personal demands and relinquish our orientations, and let us, to the contrary, exert our effort to agree on someone that carries with him our common program for building a modern country and consecrate sovereignty and independence, and re-establish the authority of the State over all of Lebanon; this is the program we should carry, not carry personal agendas. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Harb believed that on the subject of the presidency, it is not the person that matters, but the program and the history of that person, his aspirations and his ability to deal positively with all the forces. </seg>

This invitation may have already arrived, since it's been sent.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Riyadh, February 13/ Xinhua / The Secretary General of the Islamic Conference Organization, Professor Akmaluddin Ihsan Oglu, and the High Commissioner of the European Union for Foreign Policy and Security, Javier Solana, conducted talks today at the headquarters of the General Secretariat of the organization in the city of Jeddah about the repercussions of the publication of cartoons by a Danish newspaper that are offensive to the Prophet.  They aimed at reaching an agreeable resolution of this issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Oglu, the Secretary General of the organization, expressed at the start his welcome to the European guest and his appreciation for the visit to the General Secretariat of the organization under the present circumstances, in which the feelings of wrath and anger have been inflamed throughout the Islamic world as a result of attempts by certain Western newspapers to harm the sanctity of Islam under the justification of freedom of expression, as reported by the Saudi News Agency this evening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Secretary General expressed during the talks that he looked forward to the cooperation of the European Union in order to get beyond this crisis and guarantee that it is not repeated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> For his part, Solana emphasized that by coming for the first time to the headquarters of the Islamic Conference Organization, he wanted to send the Islamic public opinion a signal expressing the strong respect of Europe for Islam, and also affirming the respect by Europe for the feelings of Moslems. He also expressed his sadness and his regrets for the repercussions of the issue of the cartoons for which those responsible wrongly evaluated the feelings of the Moslems regarding the cartoons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Solana said, "All this issue had no justification and we understand the reactions of Moslems who felt grieved and prejudiced because of it," stressing his genuine desire for cooperation with the Islamic Conference Organization and the Islamic States to avoid the occurrence of such an incident in the future. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He added, "Today's world is teeming with complicated crises and the last thing we want is a clash because of these cartoons. We are keen to work for cooperation in order to create a safe world, and we are talking to put in place measures that can calm the situation first, then look into conditions that guarantee that this incident won't happen again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Solana noted the spirit of cooperation that he expressed and Oglu submitted to him a number of legal and political recommendations that could lead to guaranteeing that this crisis won't happen again. These recommendations include the approval by the European Union of legislative measures through the European Parliament to confront the phenomenon of Islamophobia in Europe and exert joint Islamic-European efforts to adopt a resolution at the General Assembly of the United Nations similar to the resolution that was recently approved under number 60 / 15 regarding the subject of "Combating the distortion of the image of religions." This prohibits offending all prophets or religions, and adopts a code of conduct by Western media that takes into consideration the sensitivity of Moslems and prohibits slandering all its expressions and manifestations and the fundamental beliefs of religions, including mocking the prophets. All of this should be considered a moral crime in the code of the Western media, and the adoption by the United Nations of an international system for the media that includes a definition of the extent of expression in the case of religious symbols within the framework of the UNESCO organization, and the inclusion of a clause in the resolution on freedom for the establishment of the new Human Rights Council that prohibits harming religions. Solana welcomed these ideas and promised to cooperate with the Secretary General of the Islamic Conference Organization, the European union and the Organization of the United Nations to implement them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He also expressed his desire for a joint meeting of the Islamic Conference Organization and the European Union to continue the meeting that included the two organizations in 2002 in Istanbul and which produced positive results in facilitating the process of understanding and dialogue between the Islamic world and the West. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The representative of UNESCO in Rabat, Ahmad Al-Sayyad, stressed the aspiration of the international organization to activate the role of the Maghrebi parliaments and the various constituents of civil society in achieving the designated objectives in the area of early childhood care, since it is a basic condition for supporting the foundations of comprehensive growth, strengthening human rights, and bolstering the values of freedom and democracy at the core of societies. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Egyptian People's Assembly Approves Postponing Elections for Local Councils </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Cairo, February 15 / Xinhua / An Egyptian parliamentary source today, Wednesday, reported that the Egyptian People's Assembly approved last Tuesday night a draft bill presented by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for postponing for two years the elections for local councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The same source, which is affiliated with the ruling National Party, told Xinhua in Cairo that the People's Assembly approved by majority vote, during the session it held last night Tuesday, the draft bill that calls for extending the term of the currently existing local councils for a period of two years, which essentially means the postponement of the elections that were supposed to be conducted over the next two months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The source noted that the assembly was the scene of heated debates between the representatives of the Moslem Brotherhood, official opposition groups, and a number of independents who opposed the draft bill on one hand, and the representatives of the ruling National Party on the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He indicated that the proposal was for the extension of the local councils for a period of two years. This period would be added to their current terms until elections for these councils are held in accordance with the new vision of the local administration system. This system was addressed in the texts of a new law that meets the requirements for a constitutional amendment which was the objective of President Hosni Mubarak's program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The source added that the holding of these elections now and under the existing local administration law would make the councils that result from these elections inconsistent with the improvements brought about by a new local administration law in terms of the vision and provisions supporting local administration and bolstering its executive and oversight jurisdictions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The source noted that the proposal for postponement for a period of two years is consistent with an important practical consideration since the postponement for a period of one year would only make the elections of local councils coinciding with the half-term renewal elections for the Advisory Council, whose procedures begin in April 2007. Practical considerations require that this be avoided, and in implementation of the preceding, the accompanying draft bill was prepared to stipulate that the existing local councils will continue for a period of two years following their current term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Egyptian Advisory Council approved the postponement of local elections two days ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The term of the current local councils in Egypt was slated to end on the 15th of next April, as was stipulated by law that the elections of the local councils be conducted within the 60 days preceding the end of their term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The opposition parties and political forces in Egypt reject the decision of the Advisory Council to approve the law postponing the elections, and accuse the ruling Democratic National Party of seeking to prevent them from holding the elections and to marginalize their role at the local level. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Cairo, February 15/ Xinhua / American diplomatic sources in Cairo announced today, Wednesday, that the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will visit Egypt next week as part of a tour that includes a number of countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, to conduct talks on the local developments in the region and the relations of the United States with those countries. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The sources explained that the talks by Rice in the region will focus on developments of the Middle East peace process in the aftermath of the victory of the Hamas movement in the Palestinian elections, particularly since Hamas does not have a clear position so far on the continuation of the peace process with Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The sources noted that Rice will stress during the visit the position of the United States in support of the establishment of a Palestinian State, but that it is important that Hamas recognizes Israel, renounces violence and disarms the militias that are affiliated with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The sources added that Rice will discuss with the leaders of the region the developing situation with regard to the Iranian nuclear dossier and the means to confront Iran's influence in the region. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Al-Qaradaghi said at a press conference he held today, Wednesday, that "President Talabani is meeting with all the main political parties, is listening to their perspectives, and is seeking to bring their positions closer in his capacity as the President of the Republic and a sponsor of the political process in the country, in addition to his being the head of the Kurdistan Alliance Bloc." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Al-Qaradaghi indicated that all the parliamentary blocs are talking about national entente and are emphasizing the absence of red lines against any list that has won in the elections. He described this position as "a good step" and that President Talabani is happy with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He continued, "The President explained in a clear manner that he did not accept the issue of the red lines, and if there are some who are talking about it, it does not mean that all the members of the bloc to which he belongs have the same opinion. Moreover, Mr. Al-Hakim has denied the existence of red lines against the participation of any bloc in the next government." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As to the shape of the next government, Al-Qaradaghi said, "The political situation in the country is of a special kind, since Iraq remains in a state of war against terrorism, in addition to the bad economic situation and the regional and international changes. This requires the adoption of a consensus for managing the country, while taking into consideration the upcoming elections," adding that Talabani is calling for the consensus principle to override the parties' narrow interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He reported that the leaders of the political blocs have not yet reached the phase of discussing details of the formation of the next government, which must be a true national unity government that includes everyone, with the necessity of not putting red lines against any bloc. It is critical at the present time to reach an agreement over a clear political program to which the next government will be committed. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A statement issued by the Department and sent to Xinhua said that the messages were sent to the US Assistant Secretary of State David Welsh, the Representative of the United Nations Secretary General Alvaro De Soto, the European Delegate for the Peace Process Marc Ott, the Russian Delegate for the Peace Process Alexander Kolzhesin, and the ambassadors, consuls and representatives of the European Union, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Canada, Australia and Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The statement noted that the messages stressed that "The continuation of the practices and attacks means the cancellation of the peace option, and stands in the way of the establishment of a Palestinian State along the borders of June 4, 1967, in addition to being part of the policy that imposes facts and dictates on the ground instead of negotiations." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The statement stated "that isolating the Al-Aghwar region means paving the way for its annexation by Israel, and this decision warns of a genuine human catastrophe since it will prevent two million Palestinians from entering the region which is a third of the area of the West Bank." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The statement added that "completing the building of the wall of expansionism and annexation has created a racist system in the West Bank, and the annexation of East Jerusalem, the isolation of Al-Aghwar, the intensified settlement activities and the continuation of confiscating water reservoirs mean that the Israeli government is executing a long-term transitional phase or a state with temporary borders in exchange for a long-term truce." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The statement warned that "The implementation of these plans means a human, agricultural, educational and health catastrophe for all the residents of the Al-Aghwar region, since the Israeli settlers, who number 8,000 settlers, now control all the water in the region of Al-Aghwar and most arable lands, in addition to the establishment of industrial settlement population centers, as well as those pertaining to the livestock." </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Why Do We Moslems Rant About Demanding Application of Human Rights to the Islamic Minorities in the West While Refusing to Apply Them to Christians in Countries Where We Make Up the Majority. </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; By Dr. Youssri Mustafa, a Moslem writer but who opposes terrorism </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If our Islamic governments, which adopt the Moslem religion as the source of their legislations, do not like human rights, particularly the rights of the practice of religious rituals by minorities, this is understood. But for human rights to be looked at with suspicion by elitist and popular parties outside the framework of government, this is something that needs to be examined and explained. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We have indeed noticed over the past years that one of the greatest challenges for human rights and women's rights groups is the incorporation of human rights into a culture that still refuses to recognize the principles of human rights and their universality. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And as we know, the principal foundation for rejecting human rights is represented by the notion of cultural specificity that argues that the values in our societies are different from the values of human rights which are described as foreign in origin and character. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And in all cases, the dilemma of disseminating the culture of human rights is not just because of restrictions by the state, but besides that, there is a general culture that is being fed by the discourse of cultural specificity that aims at de-legitimizing the universal values of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In reality, this cultural rejection is a fact that cannot be ignored, and political and ideological non-governmental forces contribute to fueling it. Better than ignoring it, one must search for its causes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I imagine that the values of human rights don't find an echo in our societies, not because they are foreign but perhaps because they are foreign to the legal and political systems that deal with human rights selectively and with double standards. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is no secret to the observer that human rights are not rejected as a whole, but in parts thereof. Collective rights, for example, are accepted, and so are political rights even if they annoy the government. But they find listening ears with opposition groups, including those that promote the discourse of cultural specificity. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As to personal rights, they are the real dilemma and they are the ones that arouse the discourse of cultural specificity, not only in governments but also with the political and ideological forces that join forces with the ruling authority to create a public opinion that is antagonistic in the name of specificity to the universality of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So when we talk about the right in development, we feel collective relief and we accuse the other, the foreign, that he is exploiting us. And we talk about the right to form parties, the opposition agrees and the government becomes enraged. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But when the matter pertains to the freedom of intellect and creed or personal rights for women, the discourse of cultural specificity appears to de-legitimize human rights on the ground that they are foreign concepts, and consequently the issue of cultural specificity is not used to confront human rights in general, but in a partial selective manner, specifically when the matter pertains essentially to personal rights and freedom. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Therefore, if we are to search for the cause of the lack of cultural legitimacy in the principles of human rights in our societies, we ought to start with our cultural and political position towards personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is, we must hold the thread from its beginning by first asking about the extent of the legitimacy of personal rights per se before talking about the legitimacy of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is a valuable article by the German philosopher Habermas entitled, "On Legitimation through Human Rights" in which he says: "Modern laws originate in their core from personal rights." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Those rights enable a legal person to behave according to their own priorities. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus, those rights discharge the person holding the right in a very qualified manner from ethical instructions or precepts of any other kind. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In any case, no one is legally compelled, within the boundaries of what is legally permissible, to publicly display their endeavors. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Habermas points to the import of personal freedom into the structure of modern law, thus becoming different from traditional legal systems, which confirms the principle of Hobbs which says:..Everything is permitted, so long as it is not explicitly forbidden, and this is what separates law from ethics. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The separation of law from ethics in modern law is an issue of importance, not because we like the law and despise ethics, but because that is the modern historical logic behind the principle of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is this separation that has allowed, historically, to constitute persons into essentially legal beings on the basis of the concept of personal rights, which is in contrast to traditional models where persons are essentially moral beings that are constituted and controlled according to the dictates of moral systems based on religion or customs or traditions or even modern political ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And if modern law is based on the principle of personal rights, ethical discourse is based on a collective universal concept of rights and obligations. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In reality, when the issue pertains to the individual in our societies, we find ourselves living in a three-dimensional framework: In the first dimension, we are legal beings by virtue of a historical evolution that we do not deny. There is a law that governs us, even if that law truncates public and personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Secondly, there are parts of civil law where the religious overlaps with the ethical, with the terrorist as a model of personal laws or freedom of thought and creed, or the practice of religious rights by minorities. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In a third aspect, we are persons who are subjected in large part to purely moral precepts that are more powerful than laws, particularly when the matter has to do with personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="26"> So even that amount of freedom, that is not restricted by the law, is restricted by ethics apart from the law. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Such a religious collective discourse, or that which is set forth in the name of customs and traditions, intervenes to impose on the individual patterns of life within a system of non-legal moral rules and restrictions through which the life of the individual is organized, by describing them as moral beings. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some may think that legal rules are in constant competition with moral rules, and to a large extent this is not true. </seg>
<seg id="29"> For the law meets ethics in a positive manner when the law and ethics criminalize together such crimes as murder and theft, for example. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But they also meet in a negative manner to restrict freedom and personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In our own societies, the law retreats except in its suppressive forms and leaves the stage for moral rules, not because they compete with it, but because these rules play a functional role to the advantage of the authority, that is, the role of social control, especially in the area of personal rights and freedom. </seg>
<seg id="32"> According to this disciplinary formula, an alliance occurs between the three powers: The political power, the religious power and the power of customs and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Whatever cannot be controlled by the law can be controlled by ethics, because there will always be some penalty that befalls the individual even if he did not break the law. </seg>
<seg id="34"> What is noteworthy is that this control operation relies on ethical penalties which may evolve into violence, whereby individuals are categorized not from the standpoint of their adherence to the law or lack thereof, but from the standpoint of an ethical segregation along the lines of the pure and the filthy in the primitive sense. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Religious discourse addressed to women relies on a kind of moral sorting, as if to say that the veil is chastity and purity, and consequently she who does not wear the veil is penalized culturally and socially in the sense that she loses her legitimacy from the standpoint of chastity and purity. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We also find this kind of sorting in political ideologies, so we hear those who say, "the honorable citizens," as an indication that those who do not follow this political program are only citizens, and if they oppose then they are sentencing themselves to be dishonorable citizens. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The language of chastity and purity and honor implies a kind of non-legal penalization for ethical beings. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Here emerges the crisis of the legitimacy of human rights, for the language of human rights is fundamentally a legal and humanist language, that is, it is designed to speak to legal beings who live under a political and legal pattern based on citizenship that recognizes and protects the personal rights of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> But the problem, as indicated previously, lies in that the legal being itself does not enjoy a cultural legitimacy, and it is replaced by essentially moral beings. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And on that basis, the discourse of human rights enters into a domain that is foreign to its language and its legal terms, and it is dealt with in a selective way in which the collective is accepted and the personal is rejected. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The legitimization of human rights cannot be established unless there is a collective admission that they are legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And this admission will not take place if there are powers that fear human rights, and individuals who do not comprehend themselves with the language of the law, which is the language of human rights, but rather with the language of morality which is the language of the political and religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="43"> And here comes the importance of defending the case of citizenship, not by describing it as a case of tolerance and shared coexistence, but - and fundamentally - by describing it as a project for civil rights and the reconsideration of the legal personality that is based on personal rights and freedom. </seg>

<seg id="5"> And Even Cows.... Err!! </seg>
<seg id="6"> 2/1/1427 01/02/2006Badriya Al-Abded Al-Rahman </seg>
<seg id="7"> I know that my topic is the hottest topic on the Islamic scene these days... </seg>
<seg id="8"> Perhaps it seems to many of you repetitive for me to talk about the Danish stupidity which rallied the feelings of Moslems all over the world...and how we were able to read and calm the situation that was a harbinger of things whose consequences cannot stand comment ... </seg>
<seg id="9"> - What's the story? </seg>
<seg id="10"> How can we well explain this exceptional behavior? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Can we read, for example, that it was a rude awakening of religious fanaticism in the century of tolerance and non-fanaticism? </seg>
<seg id="12"> Or is it a ruder awakening of anti-religious fanaticism against religion, religions and religious symbols!? </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is more surprising that this happens in a calm and peaceful country that is noticeably isolated from international decision-making...though perhaps its political stagnation, (not its prejudice) and its geographical remoteness from the regions of cultural and intellectual clashes with Moslems in particular...and with other cultures in general, is a debatable matter. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That an initiative is taken (even if exceptional) by some magazine to provoke the anger of the followers of the Islamic religion, which has millions of adherents throughout the world ... </seg>
<seg id="15"> And the more striking is for that provocation to happen not for the sake of doing good or to promote dialogue with the other...but for the sake of creating an Islamic (scapegoat) against whom can be leveled accusations, and pre-conceived and pre-determined images ... </seg>
<seg id="16"> This whole scene was a (Danish) stupidity of enormous gravity, I don't think it will go down easily in history...and I don't think that the country of cows and butter, with its extremely good and benign image, had a need to flex its muscles - when it wanted to flex them - by provoking Islamists and Moslems in all their various persuasions ... </seg>
<seg id="17"> - Why only Islam...? </seg>
<seg id="18"> And in the biggest symbol for that religion, which is its Holy Prophet, Prayers and Blessings be Upon Him...then to promote a perfect image of insolence, of precise stereotyping of Islam by portraying it as the religion of bombs and death...categorically...more than categorically...because the function of caricature in a newspaper is to corroborate an existing image...an indisputable truth that only fools challenge ...! </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is how in all simplicity we reduce and is reduced the long history of a great religion, in a caricature that is insulting to us alone and none other among the religions and the intellectual movements in the world, in the names of many of which atrocities and crimes were committed against the whole world..so that Islam remains singled out on the list of death ... </seg>
<seg id="20"> This is how the sacred is violated and the fanatic transgressions have reached and crossed the red line by hundreds of meters, without the least shame or deference to reason...as if religions have become cheap merchandise and of no importance to what they represent and do in the souls of their adherents ... </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is in summary...bad manners and impudence according to the norms of the intellect...to the norms of politics...to all norms. Nothing expresses this foolishness other than bad manners, after which Denmark should not expect any stupid behavior directed at it because of it...because it was in summary (more ungrateful and more unfair) ... </seg>
<seg id="22"> What an evil and miserable image that is...not only because it is wrong and ugly...but because it also awakens things that were stored for centuries in the Western mind against the Islamist...the Islamist of death, the sword, the horse and the beheadings for God...and nothing more .. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Vestigials that found someone to stir them up in order to unsettle the climate of relative harmony that Moslems enjoy in the West, and in Denmark specifically, because of fanatics (of any intellectual kind) who do not realize the danger of what they are doing ... </seg>
<seg id="24"> What has Denmark done to itself, by God! </seg>
<seg id="25"> And how can it want to gain our respect after all that has happened! </seg>
<seg id="26"> And how can it feel safe for its citizens in Islamic countries, and everywhere else, after the inimical anger that Moslems now feel?! </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mere questions, I don't know if they are turning or have turned over in the Danish mind, its public opinion and its decision-makers...or does this mind remain preoccupied with milking its cows and their butter fat without recognizing the extent of the predicament forced upon it by the editing team of a magazine which now represents every Dane in the mind of every Moslem ...?! </seg>
<seg id="28"> We boycott...in order to be..! </seg>
<seg id="29"> Joint calls by mobile messages and e-mails to boycott Danish products and vilify them are but a healthy and good manifestation and I unreservedly support them .. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the time of the boycott of American and Israeli goods, the Arab Islamic mind is leaping forth and making its "No's" numerous, heavy and at times difficult...but beautifully and worthy of admiration, even if we disagreed with it ... </seg>
<seg id="31"> The international mind should understand that the Moslem is no longer member of a group of countries, most of which belong to the Third World, that is taken for granted (When it is absent, they cannot be ordered as they are witnesses)... but he has become a cultured person aware of his cultural background, which is the Islamic religion, regardless of the diversity of his denominations or the disparity of his adherence to the teachings of the religion ... </seg>
<seg id="32"> The important is that he now knows how to say: No...loud and civilized, and in a way that expresses his uneasiness at the arrogance of the Westerner against the Arabs who need them, seek shelter with them, and stand in lines to obtain entry visas and work there ... </seg>
<seg id="33"> The Western arrogance that has lasted and continued and overflowed recently to the point of insulting the sacred...the scared which is a big red line in all cultures, everyone has the right to object to sarcastic and belittling insults ... </seg>
<seg id="34"> And me, when I say that, I know that my boycott, your boycott and the boycott of all of you won't hurt or diminish the prestige of Danish butter or its wide reputation...or its stupid cows...but we will do it for ourselves...in order not to lose the only and simple (no) that we own now and that fills our mouths ... </seg>
<seg id="35"> To say: we are present, and we are on this planet with all our problems and our crises...and we are capable of coexisting, and we deserve respect...and we can express ourselves and refuse...and even to hate if required ... </seg>
<seg id="36"> So that there is no strife and new hatred that is injected into the sea of hate that moves this wretched planet...I wish that Denmark takes the initiative of a broad and deeply-worded apology to the feelings of Moslems and calm the magnitude of the crisis ... </seg>
<seg id="37"> And not to expect that the united Islamic heart be cleansed in one stroke and with one apology...because the magnitude of the shock was strong and removing it won't be easy ... </seg>
<seg id="38"> For if this apology won't occur, we will spend all our life humming this refrain...ruminating over the pain of hate...raising our children and our children raising their children that Denmark and the devil are two brothers, what one of them deserves, the other deserves too ... </seg>
<seg id="39"> If this apology won't occur, the coals of hate will remain inflamed...and perhaps Denmark will be surprised by what provoked the feelings of Moslems...perhaps it will find a good application for the model of the distressed terrorist with the (bomb-strapped) turban in its land and among its beautiful fortresses and its boring cows ... </seg>
<seg id="40"> Maybe Denmark will lose all its beauty and its naiveté because of its (big mouth) ... </seg>
<seg id="41"> Maybe this time its cows blathered more stupidly than necessary... </seg>
<seg id="42"> Maybe we don't need to wait more than a few days to see something we never wished before in Denmark ... </seg>
<seg id="43"> Maybe everything will happen (there and here) ... </seg>
<seg id="44"> How much do I hate (maybe) in these contexts...God, we have had enough evil, maybe ...!!! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Five Killed In Protest Demonstrations Against The Offensive Cartoons </seg>
<seg id="6"> ________________________________ </seg>
<seg id="7"> At least five people were killed in Afghanistan in a wave of demonstrations and protests that spread across the country in protest over the publication by a Danish newspaper of caricature cartoons offensive to the Prophet Mohammad (God's Prayers and Blessings be Upon Him). </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two people were killed when protesters attacked the American Airbase in Bagram, even though there is no connection between the United States and the publication of the caricatures. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And three people were killed after police fired when protesters attacked a police center, according to a police spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In Somalia, a 14-year old boy died and others were injured after protesters attacked the police. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Acts of disturbance and demonstrations spread from Gaza to India, and from Indonesia to Iran. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Thousands of Afghans demonstrated in the city of Mehtarlam in the district of Laghman in eastern Afghanistan in protest over the publication of the cartoons offensive to the Prophet Mohammad (God's Prayers and Blessings be Upon Him.) They repeated slogans hostile to Denmark and France, and they demanded the eviction of their forces from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The protesters repeated slogans such as, "Death to Denmark" and "Death to France," and they demanded the closure of their two embassies in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="14"> One person was killed instantaneously, whereas the other died after his arrival to the hospital in Jalalabad. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Reports indicate that a number of people sustained injuries after they were struck by police gunfire. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A police official accused elements infiltrated by the Taliban of responsibility in stirring up the confrontations. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Other cities in Afghanistan were the scene of protest demonstrations against the cartoons that are offensive to the Prophet Mohammad (God's Prayers and Blessings be Upon Him), with hundreds of people demonstrating in the regions of Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif, and hundreds of others assembling outside the Danish Embassy in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In the Province of Takhar, located in northeastern Afghanistan, demonstrators pelted the government buildings with rocks, while police fired shots in the air. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And on Sunday, several Afghani cities were the scenes of demonstrations protesting against the cartoons that are offensive to the Prophet Mohammad (God's Prayers and Blessings be Upon Him), and the Danish flag was burned. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Continuation of the Protests </seg>
<seg id="21"> About 200 protesters in the Iranian capital Tehran pelt the Austrian Embassy with rocks and broke its windows, while chanting "Death to Denmark and Israel." It appears that the attackers targeted the Austrian Embassy because it is the current President of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Iranian Commerce Minister announces the immediate suspension of trade relations between his country and Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Syria is facing a demand for compensation by Norway after the burning of its embassy in Damascus Saturday. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And in Indonesia, police fired warning shots on demonstrators outside the American Consulate in Surabaya, the second largest Indonesian city. The protesters had previously smashed the windows of the Danish Consulate in the city. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Indian riot-fighting police separates hundreds of students in Delhi with gas bombs and water hoses. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Shops are closed in the Indian sector of Kashmir after a call for general strikes in protest over the cartoons. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And in Thailand, demonstrators repeated the chant "Allah is the Greatest" as they trampled the Danish flag outside the Danish Embassy in Bangkok. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Demonstrations outside the offices of the European Union in Gaza, with demonstrations having erupted last week in front of these offices as well. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The images had been published for the first time in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, but they were re-published in German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish and Hungarian newspapers, all of which said they were exercising the freedom of expression of opinion. But British newspapers refused to publish the images. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; FW: Negative And Positive Self-Programming </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; Bandar Al-Shalaan </seg>

<seg id="3"> ________________________________ </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sent: 11/Feb/2006 2:42 PM </seg>
<seg id="5"> Negative And Positive Self-Programming... </seg>
<seg id="6"> Most people are programmed since young age to behave or speak or believe in a negative way, and it grows with them until they become prisoners of what is called "Negative Programming," which limits their access to many things in this life. </seg>
<seg id="7"> So we find many of them who say I have a weak personality, I cannot stop smoking, I am poor in dictation, I am ...... . </seg>
<seg id="8"> And we find that they acquired this negativity either from family or from school or from friends or from all those combined. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, is it possible to change this negative programming and convert it into a positive programming. The answer is, .. yes and a thousand times yes. But why do we need this.???? </seg>
<seg id="10"> We need to program ourselves positively in order to be happy, successful, and live a good life so we can achieve our dreams and our goals. We must do this, particularly since we are Moslems and we have a task and a purpose that we must reach to achieve the worship of God, to Whom be ascribed all perfection and majesty, and to achieve the succession that God commissioned us for on earth. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Before we begin the program of changing negative programming, we must agree on matters, and they are: </seg>
<seg id="12"> You must decide within yourself that you want to change. This decision of yours is what will illuminate your path to changing from negativity to positivism. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A repetition of the actions and words which you will learn and make them part of your life. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now, the first way for positive programming is: </seg>
<seg id="15"> Speak to yourself: </seg>
<seg id="16"> Have you seen a person speaking loudly to himself as he walks, moves his hand and mutters, and he may be cussing and cursing. Sorry, we do not want to act like him. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Or has it happened that there was a violent argument between you and some other person, and after the person leaves you, the tape of the argument ran in your mind over again and you began imagining the argument a second time and you started replacing words and terms with others, telling yourself why didn't I say this or that ... </seg>
<seg id="18"> And has it happened that while you were attending a lecture or a speech, you talked to yourself and said: I cannot speak like this, or how can I stand in front of all these people, or you say it is impossible for me to stand in front of people to speak or lecture. </seg>
<seg id="19"> All these discussions and speeches with oneself and ourselves gives the human being a negative programming that may ultimately lead to detrimental actions. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fortunately, you and I, and any person, are capable of acting towards speaking to oneself, and it is in our ability to change any negative programming and substitute it for another new programming that strengthens us. </seg>
<seg id="21"> One psychological engineering scientist says, "We are able at any moment to change our past and our future, by re-programming our present." </seg>
<seg id="22"> Therefore, from this moment we ought to watch and pay attention to the inner calls that your being speaks about. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was said: </seg>
<seg id="24"> Watch your thoughts because they will become actions. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Watch your actions because they will become habits. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Watch your habit because it will define your character .. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Watch your character because it will define your destiny. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And I want to clarify some scientific facts about the human brain, and we focus specifically on the subconscious. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The subconscious is not conscious of things like the conscious brain. It simply stores information and repeats it later on whenever it is recalled from its site of storage. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So if it happens that a message is programmed in this brain for a long period of time and over several times, such as always saying in every situation ... I am shy I am shy ... I have an irascible temperament, or I cannot practice sports, I cannot quit smoking.... And so, such messages will be reinforced and stabilized at a deep level in the subconscious and cannot be changed. But they can be substituted with another sound and positive programming. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Another fact is that the subconscious has strange behaviors that we should watch for. For example, if I were to say the following sentence to you: "Do not think of a black horse," will you be able to do that and prevent your brain from thinking. Of course not, because more likely you have already thought of a black horse. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Why ?? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Your brain has eliminated the word "no" and kept the remainder of the phrase, which is: Think of a black horse. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore, is it possible to exploit such strange behaviors of the brain. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Let us now present to you the essential point and let Doctor Ibrahim Al-Faqi tell us what he stated in his book, "The power of self-control: Rules and a practical program for a positive programming of the self." </seg>
<seg id="36"> He says: </seg>
<seg id="37"> And now here are the five rules for programming your subconscious: </seg>
<seg id="38"> 1- Your message should be clear and specific. </seg>
<seg id="39"> 2- Your message should be positive (example: I am strong. I am OK. I can abstain from ... . </seg>
<seg id="40"> 3- Your message should indicate the present time. (For example, do not say I will be strong, but say I am strong.) </seg>
<seg id="41"> 4- Your message should be accompanied by a strong feeling for its contents so that the subconscious accepts it and programs it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> 5- The message should be repeated several times until it is fully programmed. </seg>
<seg id="43"> And now here is this plan so that speaking to yourself has a positive power: </seg>
<seg id="44"> Write down at least five negative messages to yourself that had impact on you, for example: </seg>
<seg id="45"> I am a shy person, I cannot refrain from smoking, my memory is weak, I cannot speak in public, I have an irritable temperament, and now tear the paper on which you wrote these negative messages and throw it far away. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Write down at least five positive messages to yourself that give you power, and always start with the word "I", for example: </seg>
<seg id="47"> "I can refrain from smoking" .. "I like to talk to people" .. "I have a good memory." </seg>
<seg id="48"> "I am an excellent person" .. "I am active and have strong energy." </seg>
<seg id="49"> Write down your positive message in a small diary and always keep it with you. </seg>
<seg id="50"> And now take a deep breath and read the messages one after the other until you assimilate them. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Start again with the first message, take a deep breath, and get rid of any tension inside your body. Read the first message ten times with a strong awareness, close your eyes and imagine yourself in your new "you", then open your eyes. </seg>
<seg id="52"> As of today, beware of what you tell yourself, and beware of what you say to others, and beware of what others say to you. If you notice any negative message, proceed to eliminate it by saying, "Eliminate," and replace it by another message that is positive. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Be assured that you have the power, and that you can be, and you can possess, and you can do what you want, merely by specifying exactly what it is that you want and that you move in that direction with all the power that you can muster. Jim Rohn, the author of the book "Eternal Happiness" said about this, "Repetition is the Mother of Skill"... </seg>
<seg id="54"> Which is why you have to trust what you say, and always repeat to yourself the positive messages, for you are the master of your brain and the captain of your ship ... you rule your life, and you can transform your life into an experience of happiness, health and unlimited success. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And always remember: </seg>
<seg id="56"> Live every moment as if it was the last moment of your life. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Live with faith, live with hope, </seg>
<seg id="58"> live with love, live with struggle </seg>
<seg id="59"> and appreciate the value of life. </seg>
<seg id="60"> (By permission from the book "The Power of Self-Control" by Dr. Ibrahim Al-Faqi) </seg>
<seg id="61"> And finally, pray for me for guidance, forgiveness and mercy. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Amen </seg>

<seg id="5"> Head Dandruff...Its Causes And Treatment </seg>
<seg id="6"> I think it's a very common problem, everyone suffered from it at some point in their life. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the past they used to think that the cause of dandruff is a rapid growth of the scalp cells, but this belief has been proven wrong. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Recently they discovered that the cause of dandruff is a species of yeast called Pityrosporum Ovale. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The problem appears to be the result of a poor blood circulation in the scalp. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Worry. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Using hot water when washing hair. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also, the fatty nature of hair plays a non-negligible role. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In some instances, dandruff does not cause a significant problem, but when it falls on the clothes or causes an itch or gives a foul smell to the hair, the problem begins to appear. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Elegant appearance and prestige go down the drain and dandruff becomes a question hanging off the mouth in need of an answer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The question is: Ok, how do we treat it? </seg>
<seg id="16"> There are advices that we ought to pay attention to first, and they are: </seg>
<seg id="17"> 1. Not to use other people's combs and brushes when combing hair. </seg>
<seg id="18"> 2. Pay attention to cleaning one's personal toiletries...i.e. wash the brush and the comb at least once a week. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 3. Wash the head with specific types of treatment shampoos that are available in the markets. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Here I recommend the use of Nizoral, not to advertise for it or the like, but because this shampoo contains the substance Ketoconazole, and this substance is effective in getting rid of the yeasts that cause dandruff. </seg>
<seg id="21"> 4. After using the shampoo, rinse your hair with vinegar diluted with water and massage the scalp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There are also certain prescriptions with good results. </seg>
<seg id="23"> *Wash your hair. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Rub your hair with apple vinegar. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Leave it for a quarter of an hour. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Rinse it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> *Wash your hair. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Mix ½ cup of apple vinegar and ½ cup of lemon juice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Rub your scalp with the mixture. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Leave the mixture on the head for a period of half an hour. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Rub your hair with olive oil and leave it for another half an hour, after which the hair is washed with shampoo. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Repeat the operation once a week until the dandruff is eliminated, and you may not need to use this more than once. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Olive oil, almond oil and prickly pear oil help re-balance the scalp and nourish it. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Greetings and may you stay good. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Pain In The Red Sea </seg>
<seg id="6"> My father put the life vest on me when he saw that the ferry was leaning and was almost sinking. </seg>
<seg id="7"> After that, I saw my father drown, then my mother, </seg>
<seg id="8"> and I stayed alone for 30 hours fighting the waves, being helped by one escapee, until the Rescue Forces came and lifted me out of the water. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everything is lost. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I went abroad to Saudi Arabia for three years during which I suffered a lot. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And I returned with my life's savings to marry and settle. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But suddenly everything is lost .. everything. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was a fire in the lower levels of the ferry. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the crew prevented some passengers who saw the fire from wearing the life vests on the pretext that this will cause an unnecessary state of panic with the other passengers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Then that was the result, as you see. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ferry sank and with it more than 1,000 passengers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The ferry crew told us when we saw smoke coming out of the engine room on the lower floor, "Don't worry, we will extinguish it." </seg>
<seg id="18"> And when things quickly turned to worse we did not find the life boats. Some of the workers on board the ferry took them and left us on the boat facing death alone. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 30 hours I was in the water, fighting death, </seg>
<seg id="20"> 30 hours without food or water. </seg>
<seg id="21"> My skin was almost melting. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Where is the respect for humanity? </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the ferry passengers were Israelis, would they have been treated with this negligence or with this slowness? </seg>
<seg id="24"> God gave me three children, two daughters and a son, and we were living together in Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Then we decided to return permanently and settle in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="26"> So we shipped our home's furniture and my children's books and all our belongings. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Shortly after we took off at sea, terror seized us as we saw the smoke rising from the ship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Then it tilted on its side and sank. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And I saw my three children and my wife as they screamed and were swallowing water, and I was screaming and trying to rescue them, but God's will prevailed. </seg>
<seg id="30"> They all drowned before my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Their books and some of their toys were floating on the surface... </seg>
<seg id="32"> Of Him is reparation and from Him is reparation.. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Only God has the power and the might. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When the fire became big, we heard the sounds of explosions in the ferry kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So we thought they were the result of the explosion of the gas cylinders. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We yelled at the captain to return to port of Dubah because it was closer than Safaja, but he refused. </seg>
<seg id="37"> After we were all seized by terror the captain ordered us to knock on the doors to get the passengers out of their cabins and gather them on the right side so that the ferry recovers its balance. But within five minutes, everyone was drowning. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Screams and wailing rose. </seg>
<seg id="39"> And the men were appealing to God for help, "Oh Lord, save us..Oh Lord have mercy on us </seg>
<seg id="40"> " </seg>
<seg id="41"> And some others were uttering the Two Shahadas </seg>
<seg id="42"> ***** </seg>
<seg id="43"> May God have mercy on the accident's victims and grant their relatives patience and consolation. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; The Chastity Of Men </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; Abu Suleiman </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Why is there not more value or respect for the chastity of men? </seg>
<seg id="4"> And why does the chaste man who rises above his lust arouse surprise and suspicions about himself?? </seg>
<seg id="5"> Why has the man who did not have illegitimate sex before marriage become a stupid man in the eyes of some? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Why has the man who does not betray his wife become a coward who is afraid that his wife might discover his truth or who doubts his masculinity? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Our society is very concerned about the woman's virginity </seg>
<seg id="8"> But why no one talks about the virginity of the man? </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the time of openness and progress, all means that facilitate succumbing to the forbidden have spread. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Temptations now surround us from every side, and are no longer </seg>
<seg id="11"> out of reach. There is nothing easier than the unnatural ways that drag the human being into vice. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But this is not a pretext to justify the sin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And even if the same temptations face women and men, they are both equal in punishment and accounting. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to the divine judgment in His Almighty's words: "And say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty, and say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty." </seg>
<seg id="15"> And whereas the most sound and fair of our behaviors is that we measure them according to the divine judgment and legislation, we see that in the revelation is a clear indication of disseminating the concept to man and woman. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Almighty said: "And the men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in God's praise, for them has God prepared forgiveness and great reward." [Al-Ahzab:35] </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore the chastity of the man is no less important than the chastity of the woman, and it does not diminish his masculinity, and because of this, the chastity that is asked of the woman is also asked of the man. </seg>
<seg id="18"> And we must disseminate the concept of virginity to include man and woman together, so that there is an equivalence. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But in our eastern societies where the concepts have confused, </seg>
<seg id="20"> virginity has become required only of the woman, for it is her capital asset and the foundation of the honor of her family. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the virginity of the man, it's not a problem. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Nothing sullies it, from the standpoint of the principle that any sin is allowed so long as it is not exposed before people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So this is a call to everyone to demand chastity and strengthen themselves against the forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And to eliminate the widespread belief that the chastity of a man is a suspicion from which the man is ashamed, and he avoids it so that he is not accused of retardation, little culture and poor experience. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The chastity of a man means his modesty, which is an honorable trait that embellishes its bearer. With it, man keeps faith and becomes upright. He stays clear of sin and the wrath of the Lord of the Worlds, and he protects his health from diseases. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chastity starts from the heart to reach the level of the body, and it is in a man a clear evidence of the power of his personality, his pride and his abstaining from fornication activities, the repression of lustful feelings and the discipline of the self against being driven by its passions. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The chaste person is wise and capable to control all his inclinations and instincts, and he does not satisfy them except through those things that please God. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He is a patient human being with integrity. He rises above falling to the vices of things, and he stays above his lust. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He possesses a rare character that only those whose faith is strong can muster. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the revelation, there is a prayer for every single person. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "And let them be chaste those who do not find marriage" </seg>
<seg id="32"> Thaalab explained it, saying: </seg>
<seg id="33"> "And let him control himself as with the fast, for it is honorable." </seg>
<seg id="34"> And chastity is required of the married and the unmarried, </seg>
<seg id="35"> for how many men betray their wives and brag at their gatherings of their adventures so that they do not appear before the others to be of a lesser standing or that their masculinity is diminished or that they become the subject of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="36"> My dear brother, I ask you not to weaken and to keep your purity and chastity, </seg>
<seg id="37"> and not to succumb to temptation, </seg>
<seg id="38"> and try to strengthen your faith in God. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If you weaken, remember that God sees you and that you will, and we all will, be asked about our deeds, and your masculinity will not intercede on your behalf for your Lord to forgive you, because the divine word is clear. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Chastity is not only demanded from the woman, but it is an obligation on every human being. </seg>
<seg id="41"> And do not make of society an accountant of your deeds. </seg>
<seg id="42"> For if you are saved from the accounting of this world, you will not escape the punishment of the afterworld. </seg>
<seg id="43"> And remember that death does not ask permission of its subject. </seg>
<seg id="44"> When it comes, it will not delay until you repent. </seg>
<seg id="45"> For when their term is reached, not an hour can they delay, nor can they an hour advance. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So if you are pleased with the worst of deeds, do no expect and do not ask for goodness out of life. </seg>
<seg id="47"> And remember that the reward is of the same kind as the deed. </seg>
<seg id="48"> If you are put to the test, do not expect God to give you a good wife. </seg>
<seg id="49"> God Almighty  says in the Sura of Al-Nur: "Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure, and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity. These are exonerated from what people say, for them there is forgiveness and an honorable living." </seg>
<seg id="50"> " </seg>
<seg id="51"> God, I ask you for chastity and prosperity </seg>
<seg id="52"> " </seg>
<seg id="53"> We ask God to keep away from young Moslems all misfortune and harm. </seg>
<seg id="54"> For God is the great protector and the most merciful of all. </seg>

<seg id="3"> They tied her up .. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And they deprived her of her senses ... </seg>
<seg id="5"> And she felt she was placed on something like a howdah .. in its elevation and movement ... </seg>
<seg id="6"> She heard the voice of her lover among them. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Why doesn't he chide them.../? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Why doesn't he prevent them from taking her ...????/? </seg>
<seg id="9"> The sound of monotonous steps walking on coarse sand ... </seg>
<seg id="10"> And cold morning breezes touching her white clothes .. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And though she can't see, but she imagines the environment around her to be foggy ... </seg>
<seg id="12"> And she imagines the soil on which she is now to be desolate and lifeless </seg>
<seg id="13"> .. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Finally, the steps stop all at once and she felt she was being put on the ground .. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And she heard next to her stones being lifted and others being put down .. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Then she was carried again .. and silence spread around her ... and she felt darkness gnaw at her bones... </seg>
<seg id="17"> And from above came to her ears a whimpering voice ... it's her son .. yes him... </seg>
<seg id="18"> Perhaps he is coming to rescue her??/? </seg>
<seg id="19"> But ...what is she hearing??/? </seg>
<seg id="20"> He is calling her with a low voice: Mother .. </seg>
<seg id="21"> and from between the tears her husband speaks to him, saying: hang in there ... </seg>
<seg id="22"> For patience comes with the first shock ... </seg>
<seg id="23"> Pray for her, my son ... </seg>
<seg id="24"> Let's go.. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He is overwhelmed with agony ... </seg>
<seg id="26"> And look one last time on the prostrate body ...He could not control himself in saying with a voice dripping with pain: There is no god but God... </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is no god but God... </seg>
<seg id="28"> We belong to God and to Him we shall return.. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This was the last I heard from him.. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Then the sound of a marble stone falling from above rang out to close the only opening that was the source of the voice and the light ....... and the  life ......... </seg>
<seg id="31"> The sound of the steps moving away... </seg>
<seg id="32"> Where to ???/? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Where are you leaving me ??/? </seg>
<seg id="34"> How do you abandon me in this solitude and this darkness ?? </seg>
<seg id="35"> She looked around her, and she sees ....... </seg>
<seg id="36"> Sees ???/? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Anything she can see in this black tunnel ??/? </seg>
<seg id="38"> Its darkness is not like the darkness of the night she is used to ... that one is accompanied by moonlight .. and the radiance of the stars which reflects on things and people .. But here, she can barely see her hand ... In fact she feels that her eyes are completely closed .. </seg>
<seg id="39"> She remembers her loved ones </seg>
<seg id="40"> And she heard the steps completely disappear, and a chill ran through her limbs </seg>
<seg id="41"> She stood up wishing to follow them ... </seg>
<seg id="42"> How do they leave her and they know that she dreads darkness and solitude ??/? </seg>
<seg id="43"> But a heavy hand violently forces her to sit .. </seg>
<seg id="44"> She stared at what was behind her with immense fear ... and she saw what she never saw before... </seg>
<seg id="45"> She saw terror embodied in the form of a being ... </seg>
<seg id="46"> But how does she see him through the intense blackness ??/? </seg>
<seg id="47"> She said with a shivering voice: Who are you ??/? </seg>
<seg id="48"> Then she heard a voice to her right ringing out in reverberations... </seg>
<seg id="49"> She turned around .. </seg>
<seg id="50"> There stood a being similar to the first .. </seg>
<seg id="51"> while she stood silent in her weakness... </seg>
<seg id="52"> She wished the earth would swallow her so she wouldn't see these people........... </seg>
<seg id="53"> But she remembered that the earth has indeed swallowed her .. </seg>
<seg id="54"> She wished for death to flee this place from which there is no escape........... </seg>
<seg id="55"> She returned to her wishes that were no longer useful... for she is dead anyway.. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - Who is your lord? </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Huh.. - Who is your lord ??/? </seg>
<seg id="58"> - My lord../? </seg>
<seg id="59"> I have worshiped no one but God all my life .. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - What is your religion ?? </seg>
<seg id="61"> - My religion is Islam .. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - Who is your prophet ??/? </seg>
<seg id="63"> - My prophet ??/? </seg>
<seg id="64"> Her memory was wringing.......... </seg>
<seg id="65"> What's the matter with her, she forgot his name ??/? </seg>
<seg id="66"> Didn't she always repeat it with her tongue ??/? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Didn't she pray over him in the Moslem Pledge five times a day ??/? </seg>
<seg id="68"> With an angry voice, the voice asked again: - Who is your prophet ??/? </seg>
<seg id="69"> - One moment, please ... </seg>
<seg id="70"> I can't recall .. </seg>
<seg id="71"> A thick baton went up in the hand of the being...and then came down rapidly towards her head .. </seg>
<seg id="72"> Then she screamed ........... </seg>
<seg id="73"> And her limbs went stiff ... </seg>
<seg id="74"> And suddenly his name lit up in her mind: </seg>
<seg id="75"> And she screamed at the top of her lungs: - Prophet Mohammad ... </seg>
<seg id="76"> Mohammad ... </seg>
<seg id="77"> Then she shut her eyes strenuously ...but ........... nothing happened .. </seg>
<seg id="78"> A deadly silence .. </seg>
<seg id="79"> She opened her eyes wondering </seg>
<seg id="80"> The being, whose name is Nakir told her: "A prayer you always repeated saved you (My God, oh reverser of hearts, settle my heart on your religion)." </seg>
<seg id="81"> A shudder went through her body .. </seg>
<seg id="82"> She wanted to smile out of joy ...but she couldn't... </seg>
<seg id="83"> This is not the place to smile .... </seg>
<seg id="84"> My God, when will those difficult moments end .........../? </seg>
<seg id="85"> A little later, Nakir told her: "You were delaying the dawn prayer ..... </seg>
<seg id="86"> Her eyes turned sad ... </seg>
<seg id="87"> She knew there is no escape for her this time ... </seg>
<seg id="88"> Because he did not skirt the truth ... </seg>
<seg id="89"> He pushed her in front of him ... </seg>
<seg id="90"> She wanted to cry but her tears found no course ... </seg>
<seg id="91"> She walked in front of Munker and Nakir in a long tunnel until she reached a place that looked like detention camps </seg>
<seg id="92"> ... </seg>
<seg id="93"> She felt nausea ... </seg>
<seg id="94"> And wished she would faint ...but it did not happen ... </seg>
<seg id="95"> So she continued looking at the terrifying place ... </seg>
<seg id="96"> In every corner there was screaming and blood .. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Wailing and distress ... </seg>
<seg id="98"> And bones breaking... </seg>
<seg id="99"> And bodies being burned ... </seg>
<seg id="100"> And hard faces from whose hearts mercy was removed, and they do not respond to all this pleading .. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The two kings pushed her from behind and she walked feeling her feet incapable of carrying her ... </seg>
<seg id="102"> And suddenly she approached a man lying on his back .. </seg>
<seg id="103"> And right above his back was standing a king from those with the cold hard faces .. </seg>
<seg id="104"> carrying a heavy stone ... </seg>
<seg id="105"> And before her eyes the king dropped the stone on the man's head...which smashed and separated from his body, rolling ... </seg>
<seg id="106"> She screamed </seg>
<seg id="107"> .. She cried .. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Then she was so stunned that it tied her tongue .. </seg>
<seg id="109"> But quickly the head returned to its owner .. </seg>
<seg id="110"> And the king went back to dropping the rock on it ... </seg>
<seg id="111"> Here .. she was told: - Come on .. Lie down next to that man .. - What ??/? </seg>
<seg id="112"> - Come on .. </seg>
<seg id="113"> She was violently pushed .. </seg>
<seg id="114"> She started resisting .. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And resisting .. </seg>
<seg id="116"> And resisting .. </seg>
<seg id="117"> To no avail .. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Her fate is indeed dark .. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Really dark .. </seg>
<seg id="120"> She dropped down with terror almost tearing at her guts .. </seg>
<seg id="121"> She called God for help </seg>
<seg id="122"> She saw all the doors of prayer closed .. </seg>
<seg id="123"> The era of calling for help in distress is gone forever </seg>
<seg id="124"> But if only she prayed during her prosperity .. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If only she prayed in this life .. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If only she would return to pray twice on her knees </seg>
<seg id="127"> .. Only twice on her knees .. to intercede for her .. </seg>
<seg id="128"> She looked up and she saw a king standing over her </seg>
<seg id="129"> Lifting a powerful rock with his hand .. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Saying to her: - This is your suffering until Judgment Day ... because you were derelict of your duty ... </seg>
<seg id="131"> And as despair overwhelmed her ... she saw a young man like a half moon  hurrying his steps to her location .. </seg>
<seg id="132"> She was overcome by a feeling of hope ... </seg>
<seg id="133"> For his face is full of happiness and his smile illuminates everything around him .. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The young man arrives and extends his hand to stop the king ... </seg>
<seg id="135"> So he said to him: - What's come to you ??/? </seg>
<seg id="136"> - I was sent for her ... to protect her and stop you ?? </seg>
<seg id="137"> - Is this a command from the Great and Almighty God ??/? </seg>
<seg id="138"> - yes .. </seg>
<seg id="139"> She couldn't believe her eyes ... </seg>
<seg id="140"> The king is gone ... he disappeared ...and the young man with the handsome face stayed .. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Is she in a dream ??/? </seg>
<seg id="142"> The young man gave her his hand </seg>
<seg id="143"> So she rose .. </seg>
<seg id="144"> And she asked in gratitude: - Who are you ??/? </seg>
<seg id="145"> - I am the prayer of your good son for you ...and I believed him on your behalf .. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Since you died, he has not stopped praying for you until God took his prayer in the best manner and he permitted him to respond and come here.......... </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; An Explanation Of How To Convert A Cassette Tape Into A CD </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; Mr. AbuEin </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> After entering the era of the cassette, it became virtually impossible for our house to be without these tapes, </seg>
<seg id="4"> And because of its ease of use and low price, you could find cassettes throughout  the house, the car, the office, and everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Some of these tapes are original, recorded in a professional manner and at a high price. However, some are precious home recordings of rare moments, or they might be copies of songs or such. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And now we have entered the digital age, but that does not mean that we eliminate our memories. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is possible for us to transfer these audio recordings, whether they are on a cassette tape, quarter-inch tape, or on records, and convert them to the MP3 digital format, which enables you to listen to them on the computer and digital disc players, and send them anywhere by electronic mail." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Preparation of Equipment and Instruments: </seg>
<seg id="9"> In order for you to be able to convert tape recordings into digital format on a compact disc, you first have to set up the computer with the needed equipment and programs so that it is capable to do this work. You have to have available a relatively new computer equipped with a sound card. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And in order to start, you have to connect the cassette device that you have to the computer. This is usually done by using the known connector which is shown in the image here. This connector is available wherever  electric equipment accessories are sold. and they are usually inexpensive. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One of the ends of the connector should be plugged into the sound outgoing outlet, line-out, and its other end should be plugged in the sound incoming outlet, line-in, for the sound card present in the computer. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The other thing is the need for a program capable of recording sound through the incoming outlet in the sound card. </seg>
<seg id="13"> One of the best and easy to use programs is MusicMatch Jukebox. This program has many useful uses, the most important is that you can obtain it for free on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Download and install this program on your computer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You can visit the site of this program to download it on your equipment. The address of the site is http://www.musicmatch.com/ </seg>
<seg id="16"> Or from this link, and its size is about 9 Megs, click here to download the program. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In order to be able to use the recording anywhere, in addition to providing the greater space that audio uses on the hard disk, it is better to have disk recording equipment available. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Disk recording equipment can also read the disks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> These devices use two types of disks, and both types can record sound and record information from the computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first are disks that are amenable to one-time recording, and the others are amenable to recording several times. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The second is better but are several times more expensive than the first. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Beginning the Operation: </seg>
<seg id="23"> The first step: </seg>
<seg id="24"> After you have installed the MusicMatch program and connected the stereo to the sound card using the connector mentioned, you can begin recording according to the following steps: </seg>
<seg id="25"> Start the MusicMatch program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> From the upper menu chose in succession "options", then "recorder", then "source" then "in-line." </seg>
<seg id="27"> Now a new window will appear under the window of the first program. And if it does not appear, click on the button REC. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In this window, you will see two words, "album" and "artist," click on them, then change the name to the new recording that you will be doing. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Now press the record button REC in this window, then begin playing the cassette tape on the stereo equipment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> When the recording ends, press the stop button "Stop." </seg>
<seg id="31"> The recording should be complete and placed in the musical library in the program. </seg>
<seg id="32"> You can repeat this process for any subsequent recording. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Recordings are automatically saved at a 128 kbps speed, which is more than enough for most tape recordings when high quality is required. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And as soon as the first recording is complete, you should test and confirm the sound level.. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the recording is too jumbled or soft, you can re-adjust the sound volume from the stereo to the computer or by using the Windows program itself. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the bottom of the screen and on the taskbar you will find the volume icon "in the shape of a megaphone," click on it twice then adjust the sound by using volume control or "play control." </seg>
<seg id="37"> Select "options" then "properties," then "recording" and finally "OK." A window will appear "record control," select the level of required sound volume. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Of course, you must make sure not to use the volume stopping buttons "mute button," otherwise you will not get anything in the end. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You can use the additional features that are special to recording in this program to control various sound improving elements. To do that, from the menu select "options" then "settings," then "recorder," then "advanced." </seg>
<seg id="40"> From this box, select the sound effect that you wish such as gradual fading "fades" and others.. This produces MP3 recordings resembling professional recordings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> With experience with this program and continued recording, you will become more savvy and the work will be easier and faster to convert old analog recordings into digital recordings. </seg>
<seg id="42"> After you prepare the MP3 recordings, which can total up to 74 minutes, you can begin making a digital audio compact disk. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The second step: </seg>
<seg id="44"> After you selected and collected enough MP3 recordings, you can make them into a list to record them on a compact disk, arranged as you wish. </seg>
<seg id="45"> On the right-hand side of the MusicMatch Jukebox window you find a list of the recordings. </seg>
<seg id="46"> And in order to copy a song or music piece into this list, you can use the mouse to retrieve any file from the music library into this window. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In general, the recording CD can contain 74 minutes of music. (MusicMatch does not at present handle the new 80-minute recording compact disk). </seg>
<seg id="48"> When you have completed preparing the music pieces that you want recorded on the disk, press the button "CD window" or a new dialog box will appear to you, and it contains several choices for recording the disk. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Be sure to select audio (default) as the type of disk you want. If you select the last choice, you'll be able to store more than 600 Megabytes on the empty disk, but this type does not work with the regular disk playing equipment. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The status band present at the bottom of the window tells us how much space is left on the empty disk. </seg>
<seg id="51"> You can add or delete from the list of recordings that you plan on storing on the disk by using "test then write CD," in order to produce a more precise disk. </seg>
<seg id="52"> You may also wish to leave a second or more of empty space between two pieces. </seg>
<seg id="53"> When you are ready for the copying operation, place the blank CD in the disk recording device then press the button "create CD." </seg>

<seg id="3"> A thousand new members every day </seg>
<seg id="4"> The new MySpace site steels the limelight away from Google </seg>
<seg id="5"> www.myspace.com </seg>
<seg id="6"> A new promising star shined recently in the Internet world, particularly after it succeeded in creating a name following its wide reception in technical circles. </seg>
<seg id="7"> During only two years of operation, this newcomer has attracted  many visitors and users, exceeding all expectations and surpassing the Internet giant Google with two and a half times the number of users and visitors. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The MySpace site has proved itself on the merits to become one of the most important communities on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The secret behind the success of this site is in its benefiting from previous mistakes and transforming them into strengths. This made it attractive to various young people, particularly students and musicians, by allowing them to fully interact with their friends and providing them in one place most of the services provided by other sites. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some may wonder about the secret behind the success of the site even though it is not the only one in this field, but simply why would its users have to go to another site when all their friends are on the MySpace site, particularly when users encourage their friends and insist that they join the site. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It also surpasses its competitors by allowing more customization, which allows the user to add personalization to his page through various background colors, drawings, pictures, video and numerous other features. This characteristic made it outperform its stubborn competitor Friendster with the total number of registered users exceeding 54 million users (at the rate of 180,000 new users daily) compared to the more than 24 million users of the Friendster site. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new site brings a new tool for chatting with friends and acquaintances. The personal main page has eliminated the need to download electronic mail or instant messaging software, which is the page that the user can use to exchange conversations and personal messages, in addition to the ability of following their teachers and their lectures. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And amidst all this success, the danger of the Internet lurches onto teenagers to cast its shadow over the success of the site, particularly since the number of site subscribers who are minor has reached a quarter of the total number of its users. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Several school students have been arrested throughout the United States of America after they threatened their fellow students through the site. In addition, the police of one of the states discovered illicit relations with minors who met men pretending deceitfully to be of a younger age on the site, which prompted parents and guardians to forbid their children from using the site, fearing such dangers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But that did not deter the site owners from forging ahead in developing it and outfitting it with international services to broaden the range of its users, since users from all over the world are coming to it raising the slogan, "We will do everything to keep our users with us." </seg>

<seg id="3"> This Is How Love Should Be </seg>
<seg id="4"> Main: General: Wednesday 9 Al-Muharram 1427 A.H. - 8 February 2006 A.D. The agenda of Islam: </seg>
<seg id="5"> In order for Moslems to know the standing of their Prophet, God's prayers and peace be upon Him ...........and in order for Moslems to know how true love for this great Prophet should be ...........the following positions have been taken. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Abu Bakr, May God be pleased with Him ...... </seg>
<seg id="7"> And here are these feelings for you designed by the heart of our Master Abu Bakr in words that read, </seg>
<seg id="8"> Our Master Abu Bakr says: We were in the Hegira and I was thirsty thirsty [very thirsty, so I brought diluted yogurt and gave it to the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, and I said to him: drink, oh Prophet of God, </seg>
<seg id="9"> Abu Bakr says: So the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, drank until my thirst was quenched!! </seg>
<seg id="10"> Your eyes are not deceiving!! </seg>
<seg id="11"> The words are true and deliberate, this is how Abu Bakr said them .. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Did you taste the beauty of this love? </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is love of a special kind..!! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Where do we stand with respect to this love!? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Here it is to you and do not be surprised, </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is love </seg>
<seg id="17"> .. The love of the Prophet is greater than the self .. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On the day of the conquest of Mecca, Abu Qahafa became a Moslem [Our Master Abu Bakr's father], and his becoming a Moslem was very late, and he had become blind. So our Master Abu Bakr took him to the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, to announce his becoming a Moslem and pledge his allegiance to the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said: "Oh Abu Bakr, why did you not leave the old man at his home, and we would have gone to him?" </seg>
<seg id="20"> Abu Bakr said: "For you are more worthy to be come to, Oh Messenger of God." </seg>
<seg id="21"> And Abu Qahafa became a Moslem .. And our righteous Master Abu Bakr cried, </seg>
<seg id="22"> So they told him: "This is a day of joy, your father has become a Moslem and escaped the fire, so why do you cry?" </seg>
<seg id="23"> Imagine .. What did Abu Bakr say..? </seg>
<seg id="24"> He said: "Because I would have liked that the one who pledged allegiance to the prophet now was not my father, but Abu Taleb, because that would make the Prophet more happy, Glory to God." His happiness for the Prophet's happiness is greater than his happiness for his father. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Where do we stand with respect to this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Omar, May God be pleased with Him, says: "I was walking with the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, and some of His companions were with us, and the Prophet took my hand and walked." </seg>
<seg id="27"> Omar says: "I found myself saying, 'By God, oh Messenger of God, I love you'." </seg>
<seg id="28"> So the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said to him: "More than your son, Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="29"> I said: "Yes." </seg>
<seg id="30"> He said: "More than your folks, Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="31"> I said: "yes." </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said: "More than your money, Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="33"> I said: "yes." </seg>
<seg id="34"> He said: "More than yourself, Omar?" </seg>
<seg id="35"> I said: "No," [And see how truthful he is with himself and with the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him] </seg>
<seg id="36"> So the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said: "No, Omar. Your faith is not complete until I am loved by you more than you love yourself." </seg>
<seg id="37"> Omar says: "So I went out and I reflected, then I came back proclaiming it: By God, oh Messenger of God, you are indeed loved by me more than I love myself." </seg>
<seg id="38"> So the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said: "Now, Omar, now." </seg>
<seg id="39"> Then Abdullah Bin Omar said: "What did you did you do, father, to come back with that?" </seg>
<seg id="40"> Omar said: "Son, I went out and I asked myself, who do I need more on Judgment Day, myself or the Messenger of God? </seg>
<seg id="41"> So I found that I need Him more than I need myself, </seg>
<seg id="42"> and I remembered how I was in the dark and God saved me through Him." </seg>
<seg id="43"> And Abdullah Bin Omar said: "If you were to forget everything about the Messenger of God, which is the one thing that you will never forget?" </seg>
<seg id="44"> Omar said: "If I forget what I forgot, I will not forget the day I went to Him, saying: "Permit me to go out to the Minor Pilgrimage, oh Messenger of God." </seg>
<seg id="45"> So he said to me: "Do not forget us, oh brother, from your good prayers." </seg>
<seg id="46"> He said a word that made me happy and meant the world to me! </seg>
<seg id="47"> Those who only read those words will not feel them .. </seg>
<seg id="48"> They are, by God, feelings that need a heart who loves the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, to receive them as they are ..fresh and tender. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thawban, May God be pleased with Him </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, was absent all day from our Master Thawban, his Servant. When he came, Thawban said to Him: "I missed you, oh Messenger of God," and he cried. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said to him: "And this makes you cry?" </seg>
<seg id="52"> Thawban said: "No, oh Messenger of God. But I remembered your place in Heaven and my place, and I remembered the loneliness." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And the Word of God was revealed, {All who obey God and the Messenger are in the company of those on whom the grace of God - from among the prophets, the righteous, the martyrs and the virtuous - The fellowship of those is a good thing} Al-Nisa Sura[69] </seg>
<seg id="54"> Sawad, May God be pleased with Him </seg>
<seg id="55"> Sawad Bin Aziyah, on the day of an attack, was someone standing in the middle of the army. The Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said to the army: "Stand ..Straight." </seg>
<seg id="56"> The Prophet looks and sees that Sawad did not straighten himself. </seg>
<seg id="57"> So the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said: "Straighten up, Sawad." </seg>
<seg id="58"> Sawad then said: "Yes, Messenger of God. He stood there but did not straighten up." </seg>
<seg id="59"> Then we heard the tree trunk moan at the separation from the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, came to him with his baton and pricked him in the belly. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Then Sawad said: "You hurt me, oh messenger of God. God has sent you with the truth, so lead me!" </seg>
<seg id="62"> Then when they built a podium for him, he left the tree trunk and went to the podium. </seg>
<seg id="63"> So we find the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, stepping down from the podium and going back to the tree trunk, and wiping it. </seg>
<seg id="64"> He said: "Straighten up, Sawad." </seg>
<seg id="65"> The Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, was preaching at his mosque before the podium was erected next to the tree trunk so that the companions could see him ... And the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, stood holding the trunk. </seg>
<seg id="66"> What do you think of that love? </seg>
<seg id="67"> And finally, do not be less than the tree trunk ... </seg>
<seg id="68"> And it said: "Oh Messenger of God, I think that today is a day of pledging, so I wanted for the last pledge to you that my skin touches yours." </seg>
<seg id="69"> And the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, says to it: "Wouldn't you be pleased to be buried right here and be with me in Heaven?" </seg>
<seg id="70"> And the tree trunk went silent.. </seg>
<seg id="71"> And Sawad rushed to the Prophet's belly, kissing it. He said: "This is what I wanted." </seg>
<seg id="72"> And the Prophet uncovered his noble belly and said: "Take your revenge, oh Sawad." </seg>

<seg id="4"> The Title: Why is Most of the Qur'an Addressed to Males?! </seg>
<seg id="5"> The responder is Dr. Hussein Al-Jizani, member of the teaching staff at the Islamic University in the Prophet's city Medina. </seg>
<seg id="6"> New classification, date 01/12/1427, A.H. [February 11, 2006, A.D.] </seg>
<seg id="7"> The question is that in the Qur'an we see - most of the time - that God addresses men, and a similar situation is seen in the Prophetic Hadith. Why? </seg>
<seg id="8"> The answer is, Praise to God and Prayers and Peace upon the Messenger of God, then </seg>
<seg id="9"> this question was actually brought up by the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salma - may she pleases God - when she said: "I said to the Prophet - Prayers and Peace Upon Him -: 'Why is it that we are not mentioned in the Qur'an as men are mentioned?'" </seg>
<seg id="10"> God Almighty's word was then revealed: "Moslem men and women, believing men and women...."([Al-Ahzab:35] the verse. Supported by Ahmad (26575), and interpreted by Al-Tabari (10/22). </seg>
<seg id="11"> And whereas the Holy Qu'ran was revealed in the language of the Arabs, it came according to their manner of speech where women are subsumed under the language of men, because in Arabic the masculine overrides the feminine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> When the man says: "Enter, and exit," he means by that to address all those present, male and females. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is not proper in the language of the Arabs for him to say: "Enter men and enter women, and exit men and exit women." </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is known as well by the Sharia's evidence and interpretations that the mandate of Sharia's judgments is addressed to men and women, for they are all mandated, addressed, held accountable, repented and punished. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is the uniform foundation and the general rule, which is the association of men and women in all provisions, side by side. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, there are provisions that are special for men but not women, such as the proscription of gold and silk and the duty of Friday and Jihad. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Just as there are provisions especially for women but not men, such as the veil, caring for the children and such others as required by the nature of each of the two genders. And God is All-Knowing. </seg>

<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; mohamed khawas &lt;mmakhawas@... </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> http://www.dorar.net/book_view.asp?book_id=7435 The Sunna of God is that Moslems cannot seek revenge from he who blasphemes or insults the Messenger </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sheikh Ul-Islam Ibn Tamima, May God have mercy on Him said: ((In God's Sunna is that if the faithful cannot punish the one among those who harm God and His Messenger, then God Almighty will avenge His Messenger and that is enough for Him)). </seg>
<seg id="5"> The story of God annihilating one by one those mockers is known. It was mentioned by the biographers and interpreters, and according to what was said they are a group of people from Quraysh: Among them, Al_Walid Bin Al-Maghira, Al-Aahss Bin Wa'el, Al-Aswadan Bin Al-Mutleb, Ibn Abed Yaghuth and Al-Hareth Bin Qayss. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, wrote to Xerxes and Caesar and both of them did not embrace Islam, but Caesar honored the letter of the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, and he honored his messenger. So his reign endured. It is said: "Reign lasts in his posterity till today (1), </seg>
<seg id="7"> And Xerxes tore the letter of the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, and he mocked the Messenger of God, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, so God killed him a short while later and completely destroyed his reign, and the family of Xerxes no longer has a kingdom, and this is so - God is All Knowing - </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is commonly said: "The flesh of scholars is poisoned," so what about the flesh of prophets, God's prayer and peace be upon them. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the Sahih Hadith, the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said: "God Almighty says: He who has made an enemy of me while supporting me, had dueled me in combat." So what of those who make enemies of the prophets? </seg>
<seg id="10"> And he who wages war on the Prophet, war shall be waged on him. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And if you were to read the stories of the prophets that are mentioned in the Qur'an, you will find that their nations perished when they harmed the prophets and met them with ugly words and actions, and so were the children of Israel for they were stricken with lowliness and brought on themselves the wrath of God. They had no supporters in killing the prophets unjustly, in addition to being infidels, as God mentioned in His Book. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And perhaps you won't find anyone that harmed one of the prophets that did not then repent, otherwise it was inevitable that God struck him with some calamity. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We mentioned what the Moslems were experienced in bringing revenge swiftly against infidels if they engaged in blasphemies against the Messenger of God, God's prayer and peace be upon Him. Similar situations reached us in several instances, and this is a vast area that cannot be covered completely, and it is not our purpose here, but we intended to demonstrate the wisdom of the Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is similar to the statements of many Moslem legal scholars regarding their numerous experiences in surrounding fortresses and cities in the northern shores. When the Moslems besieged the tribe of Al-Asfar in our time, they said: "We were besieging the fortress or the city for a month or more, and it was resisting us until we almost despaired. Then its people engaged in blaspheming the Messenger of God, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, and besmirching His honor, which made us redouble our efforts in conquest, which took no more than a day or two. The place would be conquered by force and a great butchery would be made there. They said: "Even if we would have started to accelerate the conquest, if we heard them besmirching Him, our hearts would be filled with wrath for what they said about Him." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Thus some our trusted friends told me that the Moslems of the people of Morocco had experienced with the Christians as well, and the Sunna of God that His enemies be made to suffer punishment once from Him, and once at the hands of his faithful worshippers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Almighty used to protect Him and spare him the harm and insult of people by all means, even in pronunciation; </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the "Al-Sahihin" by Abu-Harira, he said: "The Messenger of God, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, said: 'Don't you see how God keeps away from me the blasphemies of Quraysh and their curses. They blaspheme with vilification and they curse with vilification, and I am Mohammad,' so God made his name virtuous and raised it above harm, and He deflected this to those who are slanderers, even if the harmful aimed at Him." </seg>
<seg id="18"> And what proves that blaspheming is a crime, in addition to its being infidel and hostile - and if it included that - The Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, used to forgive the deceitful ones who harmed Him as shown earlier, when he could have killed them as stated earlier in the discussion about Abu Bakr and others. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if blaspheming was simply a response, he ought to be killed like the apostate must be killed, for even as he would be vanquished by blaspheming against the Prophet, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, since He is allowed to pardon him. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And the evidence that blaspheming is a deliberate crime, if the Dhimmi blasphemes one of the Moslems or the allies and he violates the covenant, the blaspheming by this man would a be a crime held against him, for which he deserves to be punished more than just for violating the covenant. So can blaspheming of the Messenger of God, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, be less than blaspheming one human being? </seg>
<seg id="21"> He, may God have mercy on Him, said: "To purify the earth from the phenomenon of blaspheming the Messenger of God, God's prayer and peace be upon Him, is a duty when possible, because coming from the complete manifestation of the religion of God and the rise of the word of God, and with religion in its entirety belonging to God, whenever blaspheming him appeared and there was no revenge on he who did that, the religion would not be pure and the word of God would not be high. It must also be purified from the fornicators, the polytheists and the bandits whenever possible. Contrary to this purification, cleansing it from infidels is not a duty and we can allow the People of the Two Books to settle on their religion as Dhimmis because their acceptance of the Dhimmi status makes them committed to the process of the rule of God and His Messenger over them. This does not contradict the prevalence of religion and raising the word. However, it is permissible to make a truce with the infidel and exempt him from punishment when it is not possible or when it is in our interest. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The earth must be purified from every crime according to one's capacity. Its perpetrator must be punished according to the Sharia. If there is no designated penalty, it is obligatory to have the person killed; because there is no designated penalty for this crime, because the right of God, His Messenger and all the faithful are on the line. This way, the difference between the blasphemer and the infidel will be apparent, which allows the latter to recognize his disbelief, to conceal it and abide by the rule of God and His Messenger, unlike the one who expresses the blasphemy. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Is it permissible for a Moslem to recite the Qur'an or praise God (in thought) in his heart, and without saying it, while he is in the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="4"> The answer: </seg>
<seg id="5"> Praise be to God </seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. Praising God is two-fold: Praising with one's tongue such as reciting the Qur'an, invocations and prayers which the Sharia encourages, and praising in one's heart by thinking about God Almighty's glory and ability, and thinking about His creatures, all glory and majesty to Him, or to elicit the Qur'an in one's heart, which does not have the reward of reciting the Qur'an because the reward is dependent on recitation, which can only be done with the tongue. Similarly with the prayers, and they are conditioned on being with the tongue and it is not enough to elicit them in one's heart. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The scholars have distinguished between the two forms of praising, and they said: "It is undesirable to praise God Almighty in the bathroom with one's tongue in glorification of God by mentioning Him in that place," but about praising God in one's heart they said: "It is not undesirable and it is good." </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in indication of the difference between the two forms of praising is that the scholars agreed that the ritually impure may elicit the Qur'an in his heart, but if he were to recite it with his tongue and utter it, that would be forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Al-Nawawi said: "They agreed that if the ritually impure were to handle the Qur'an in his heart without moving his tongue, he would not be a reader committing the forbidden impure recitation." (Al-Nawawi's explanation for the upright Moslem, 103/04.) </seg>
<seg id="10"> Ibn Al-Munther in Al-Awsat said: "Akramah said he does not invoke God with his tongue while in the toilet, but in his heart." (Al-Awsat, 341/1.) </seg>
<seg id="11"> The Permanent Committee said: "Of the proprieties of Islam is for human beings to praise their Lord when they want to enter the toilet or the bathroom by saying before entering: 'God, I seek your protection from wickedness and wicked acts,' and not invoke God after they enter and cease invoking Him upon entering." (Fatwas of the Permanent Committee, 93/5.) </seg>
<seg id="12"> Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz said: "Praising God in one's heart is permissible in any time and place, in the bathroom or elsewhere. But it is undesirable in the bathroom and similar places to invoke God with one's tongue in glorification of Almighty God, except naming Him when performing the ablutions is allowed only if ablutions cannot be performed outside the bathroom; for it is an obligation with some of the scholars, and a certain rule with the public." (Fatwas of Sheikh Ibn Baz, 408/5.) And God is All Knowing. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Oslo 2/06 (A.F.P) - The former U.N. envoy to the Middle East, Terje Roed Larsen, believes that the situation in this region has never been as dangerous as it is now, comparing the region to "a barrel of gunpowder with a burning wick." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In an interview with Norwegian State Broadcasting (NRK), Roed Larsen said, "The region now can be compared, in many aspects, to a barrel of gunpowder with a burning wick". </seg>

<seg id="4"> He added, "I believe the situation is more difficult, complex, and dangerous than it has been in many decades." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Among the current and latent crises in the Middle East, Roed Larsen mentioned the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Iranian nuclear issue, and the crisis between Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He said that "All this brings us back to questions of fundamental values and opinions that put the situation at risk of getting out of control at any moment more than it has been in recent days." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Roed Larsen did not explicitly mention the violence that pervaded the demonstrations in the Islamic World in protest against the publication of cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad in the European newspapers. He just stressed the necessity of "dialogue" instead of "throwing stones and setting fires." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Demonstrators set the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Damascus on fire Saturday, and a building containing an office of the Danish Embassy in Beirut was also set on fire in response to the publication of the drawings in September in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, and their subsequent republication in a number of European media, foremost among them the Norwegian magazine Magazinet. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Brussels 2-7 (AFP) - In a statement to the French Press Agency, the mayor of the western Belgian town of Middelkerke, Michel Landuyt, announced that he had decided to ban the display of a controversial artwork by the avant-garde Czech artist David Cerny, depicting the toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein shackled, deeming it as "shocking." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem 2-7 (AFP)- During a meeting with young settlers on the West Bank, aired by the Israeli channel 2 television Monday night, the head of Israel's domestic security agency (Shin Bet), Yuval Diskin, warned against the danger of "Jewish terrorism"ز </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Diskin told students at a religious institute for quasi military training "I will be perfectly honest with you, if a Jew carries out a terrorist attack he would ultimately be considered a cancer to the nation, and would constitute a much greater danger than Hamas," referring to the Islamic Resistance Movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Diskin made these comments about a month ago, but his speech, which was recorded, was not broadcast by Israeli channel 10 until Monday evening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I assure you that we will prosecute a Jewish terrorist who kills an Arab as vigorously as we would an Arab who kills a Jew," he added. But he acknowledged that that an Arab receives "severer treatment than a Jew accused of committing the same offenses." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He expressed his great apprehension about the "hard-line tendency" among young settlers who are using violence to express their opposition to the dismantling of the settlements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand Diskin considered that the fall of the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was, in the long run, "harmful for Israel" because of the "chaos that has spread in Iraq." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Tens of thousands of settlers and right-wing extremists rallied Sunday night in West Jerusalem. The theme of the rally was "Olmert is bad for the Jews," referring to the acting Prime Minister. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas Rejects What Certain Parties in Fatah Consider Dangerous for Palestinian National Project </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Tahir Al-Majdhub </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A reprint with a clarification in the fourth paragraph </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ramallah (the West Bank) 2/08 (AFP)- Some circles in the Fatah movement expressed their fear that the Palestinian national project may be jeopardized by the coming to power of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the Palestinian Authority. But the Islamic Movement has strongly rejected this suggestion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Adnan al-Dumayry, a Fatah leader in the West Bank, emphasized to Agence France-Presse that "Hamas, as part of the global Muslim Brothers movement, is not concerned with the regional issue of the Palestinian state as much as it is concerned with the issue of Islam as an international movement." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He said that "The other side is that Hamas is a resistance movement that can be compared to the Taliban movement and the Chechen movement, and this feature distinguishes it from other Islamic movements in the Arab and Islamic world. But Hamas has not carried out operations outside Palestine." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Al-Dumayri, who was nominated by the Fatah movement in the last elections but did not win, believes that the difference between Hamas and Fatah is that "Fatah has a program which calls for trying through negotiations to establish a Palestinian State in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital on basis of the 1967 borders, and that Fatah regards this as a strategic solution, while Hamas considers it a phase." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the same context, a Palestinian official who refused to reveal his identity emphasized that "Hamas belongs to the Islamic movement that is not interested in establishing a regional state as much as it is interested in establishing the Islamic Caliphate. Accordingly, its interests may intersect with those of Tehran and Damascus, and it is a potential ally of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran, and the Muslim Brothers in any country." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He added, "even Syria may make use of it within the framework of its continuing its policy aiming at trying to manipulate the Palestinian and Lebanese issues in order to put pressure on Israel, especially since the Baath Party also itself regards the regional issue as secondary with respect to Arab nationalism. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, if Hamas accepts a truce with Israel for 10 or 15 years, it may give up the issue of liberation and concentrate on imposing the Islamic project on the society, as he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> More than one official in Hamas has stressed that the Islamic movement which is now preparing to form the new Palestinian government is ready to enter into long-term truce with Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In an interview with France-Presse, Hamas representative Mahmoud al-Rumhi, strenuously denied that Hamas is jeopardizing the Palestinian national project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He said, "There is no basis of truth to this claim. The unilateral Israeli policy began before the victory of Hamas. It happened while the Fatah movement was still in power because the 1994 Oslo Agreements did not set a date for ending settlement activity, and it did not define the borders of the Palestinian state." So the movement bears no responsibility for jeopardizing the Palestinian project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He also added that within the context of the same unilateral policy, Israel decided "to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and build the separation wall before the victory of Hamas, and even before a date was set for the legislative elections, and before Hamas's decision to participate in them." He emphasized that "Israel does not respect any of the agreements that have been made, and the negotiations have not ended that. The only solution is continued resistance." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The head of the Hamas Political Bureau, Khaled Meshal, declared today, Wednesday, that the movement might observe "a long-term truce" with Israel if it withdrew to the 1967 borders and "recognized Palestinian rights." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Al-Rumhi said, "Such a truce is contingent on the establishment of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, including East Jerusalem, and the release of the prisoners." He emphasized, "If these conditions can not be met, and if Israel does not release any prisoners and does not withdraw from the West Bank, Hamas will no longer be bound by the cease-fire to which it agreed in the Cairo Agreement." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Ahmad Saadat, Secretary General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told France-Presse from his prison in Jericho, "We have no fears that any Palestinian party might give up the Palestinian project because the battle is basically with the Israeli occupation. We have not heardd from the Hamas Movement that it will give up any of the principles of the Palestinian issue under any banner or program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He stressed that "Adhering to these principles and resisting the occupation are common denominators," and "The resistance is linked to the occupation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saadat added "We are waiting for what Hamas has to offer. What is required from all forces within the Palestinian society is a democratic vision and an internal consensus with regard to the election of members of the legislative council as the first step. The second step must be the participation of our expatriate citizens through direct election." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Noteworthy is the fact that both the Popular Front and Hamas reject the Oslo Agreements and the roadmap. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Bassam al-Salhi, Deputy for the alternative parliamentary bloc (People's Party-leftist), believes that "It is still premature to jump to general or hasty conclusions for a number of reasons, among which is the fact that the victory of Hamas does not necessarily mean a definite political imbalance." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Rather, he called for "A reexamination of the results because Hamas support in the Palestinian street is no more than half the electorate, at 40%." He added, "I believe that the program of the PLO -- independence, international legitimacy, and the Arab peace initiative -- has the support of the majority in the Palestinian street." </seg>

<seg id="23"> Al-Salhi said, "It is very difficult for any political movement to reach agreements with less than this program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Al-Salhi also noted that his bloc "is considering proposing a draft resolution in the Legislative Council or in the Central Council of the PLO to declare the 1967 borders as the borders of the Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital, and demanding the world's recognition of this because the issue of borders is not an issue for negotiations but an issue of conflict." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Al-Salhi also stressed, "We now believe that the first and foremost task is to rebuild the Palestinian democratic movement on a more open basis for its political and social domains based on a declaration of independence, because that would define a social vision for the political system based on a secular system." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Suzuki to Declare Its Future in World Championship Rallies Soon </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tokyo, 2/8 (AFP) - The Suzuki Corporation of Japan declared that it will soon reveal its plans for participating in world championship rallies or not, without giving details about this matter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> David Farquhar, Media Officer and Head of the Public Relations Department at the Japanese corporation, declared that an announcement will be made in the sidelines during the Geneva Automobile Show at the end of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many parties in the World Rally Competition believe that Suzuki may join the family of official manufacturers starting next year, since it now participates in the Junior W.R.C. category with the Swift S1600. It won the title in the Sweden Rally, the first phase of the championship for this group, and the second phase of the W.R.C. Championship with its Swedish driver Per-Gunnar Andersen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Suzuki participated in many rallies outside these two categories, constituting preparation for the possibility of officially joining the senior category in the world championship. These expectations were supported by today's announcement that it will make a decision concerning this matter on the 28th of this month at two o'clock Geneva local time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If it decides to participate, this would constitute a great support for the championship, especially after the withdrawal of the two French companies -- Citroen, the world champion for the past three years, and Peugeot -- as well as the Japanese Mitsubishi, the Czech Skoda, and the Korean Hyundai from official participation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Citroen will return to the championship next year with its new vehicle, the C4, instead of the Xara. The company gives quasi-official support to the Belgian company Kronos Racing (Citroen Xara), and to its two drivers the French Sebastien Loeb, the world champion for the past two years, and his Spanish colleague Xavier Pons. It also supports his compatriot Daniel Sordo, last year's Junior W.R.C. champion, who is following in the steps of Loeb himself, who was crowned champion of this category before moving to the senior category. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the event of Suzuki's participation and the return of Citroen next year the number of official manufacturers in the championship will rise to four, with Subaru and Ford, which won the first two phases of this year's championship with its new driver, the Finnish Markus Groenholm. Other participation in the "special category" is limited, as is the case with the Finn Tony Gardmeister (Astra Racing -- Peugeot307), who did not participate in Sweden's rally after coming in third in Monaco, the French Gil Panizzi (Red pole - Skoda), and the Italian Gigi Galli who is participating at his own expense (2005 Mitsubishi Lancer W). </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem 2/10 (AFP)- Israeli Minister of Education Meir Sheetrit, today, Friday, characterized Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to Hamas leaders to visit Moscow as "a real stab in the back" of Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a statement to the Israeli public broadcasting service the minister said that "This initiative is a real stab in the back because its goal is to give international legitimacy to a terrorist group. We have to oppose it by all means." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The minister continued, "What would Moscow say if we invited representatives of Chechnya to visit Jerusalem?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Sheetrit added, "Russia, which prevents the holding of free elections in Chechnya, cannot give us ethical lectures about the legitimacy of Hamas after the elections." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For his part, Housing Minister Zeev Boim said in a press release that "Putin is playing with fire" and characterized the Russian position as "very troubling." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On Thursday evening, a high-ranking Israeli official expressed Israel's great displeasure with the latest Russian position. He said that "When the Chechens carry out an attack in Moscow, Russia considers it an act of terrorism, but that is not what it is when it takes place in Jerusalem," in reference to dozens of suicide operations carried out by Hamas over 10 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On Thursday, Putin declared in Madrid that he would "soon" invite Hamas officials to Moscow to hold discussions about the future of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Nasib Azar </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Damascus 2/11 (AFP) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad issued three presidential decrees today, Saturday, making cabinet changes that bring 14 new ministers into the government. In particular, changes have been introduced to the posts concerned with Foreign Affairs. This coincides with the external pressure campaign that has preoccupied Syria for more than a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> By virtue of the first decree, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara was appointed as "vice president in charge of implementing foreign affairs and media policies." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second decree introduced changes to the government of Muhammad Naji al-Utri, bringing 14 new ministers into the government in sensitive posts such as Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Information. Walid Mualem was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs after serving as a deputy to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Farouk al-Shara. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The third decree appointed Syria's representative to the United Nations, Faysal al-Miqdad, as a deputy to the foreign minister, as a successor to Mualem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The cabinet reshuffle did not include the office of prime minister which remains occupied by Muhammad Naji al-Utri, while General Bassam Abd al-Majid was appointed Minister of Interior, replacing Ghazi Kanaan, who committed suicide last October 12th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> General Abd al-Majid was the Head of the Military Police in Syria since 2002. Before that he was an official in the intelligence service of the Southern region of Syria. He was born in Quneitra in 1950. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the Ministry of Information, Mahdi Dakhlallah was dismissed and replaced by Muhsin Bilal, who was Syria's Ambassador to Spain for many years. He is also a teacher at Damascus University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Sufyan Allaw was appointed Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources to succeed Ibrahim Haddad Ghiyath Barakat was appointed Minister of Higher Education to succeed Hani Murtada. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Minister of Defense Hassan Turkomany remained in his post, as did Buthayna Sha'ban, Minister of Expatriates, Muhammad al-Husayn, Minister of Finance, and Amir Husni Lutfi, Minister of Economy and Trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Joseph Suwayd was appointed as Minister of State. He is the first member in the Syrian National Social Party to be appointed as minister since the party has joined the National Front in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Baath Party got the lion's share in the government, given 19 ministries, including the office of prime minister. Seven ministers from seven parties represented in the National Progressive Front were appointed, in addition to seven independent ministers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The National Progressive Front includes an assembly of 10 parties headed by the Baath party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Usually all nine parties in the National Front other than the Baath Party were represented by one minister in the government. But the current cabinet reshuffle left two parties unrepresented: the Arab Socialist Union Party, headed by Safwan Qudsi, and the Movement of Socialist Unionists, headed by Ghassan Abd al-Aziz Uthman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The other parties of the Front are represented by six ministers of state, while the Communist Party was given the Ministry of Irrigation, represented by Yusuf al-Faysal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This cabinet reshuffle was not a surprise since there has been talk about it since the suicide of Minister of Interior Ghazi Kanaan whose post has been vacant since his death last October 12th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> These ministerial changes coincide with an international pressure campaign that Syria was confronted with a result of the investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, since two reports by the International Investigation Committee pointed out to the involvement of Lebanese and Syrian security personnel in the assassination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The United States also accuses Syria of facilitating the infiltration of Arab fighters into Iraq across Syrian territory. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> By Hammoud Mansar </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Sanaa 2/11 (AFP)- Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih today, Saturday, made a change in his cabinet, as reported by the Yemeni Saba News Agency, after the escape of 23 supposed members of Al-Qaeda from a Yemeni prison last week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Yemeni President decided to keep Prime Minister Abd al-Qadar Ba Jamal as the Head of Government, and dismissed Minister of Defense Abdallah Ali Ulaywa and 15 other ministers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Yemeni president dismissed Deputy Prime Ministers 'Ulwi al-Salami and Ahmad Sufan who respectively held the posts of Minister of Finance and Minister of Planning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Minister of the Interior Rashad al-Ulaymi kept his post and he also became the only Deputy Prime Minister. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Brigadier General Muhammad Nasir Ahmad Ali was appointed Minister of Defense. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The outgoing cabinet was formed in May 2003 after the victory of the ruling General People's Congress Party in the legislative elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The cabinet change comes in the wake of criticism directed at the Yemeni government, particularly by the United States, after the escape of 23 alleged Al-Qaeda members from a prison run by the Yemini intelligence service in Sanaa last Saturday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Among the fugitives are 13 men convicted of the bombing of the American destroyer Cole and the French oil tanker Limburg. The most prominent among them is Jamal al-Badawi who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the case of the bombing of the US destroyer in 2000 in which 17 American soldiers were killed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Yemeni authorities carried out a campaign to track the fugitives and arrested around 95 of their relatives in an attempt to force them to turn themselves in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The prisoners escaped through a 44 meter long tunnel that connected their prison cell to a nearby mosque. The diameter of the tunnel did not exceed 70 centimeters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Warships of the U.S.-led coalition forces that cruise the waters facing Yemen participated in the search for the 23 fugitives, and Interpol issued an international notification of their escape. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Yemen is the country from which the family of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda who claimed responsibility for the attack, originates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Yemen has worked with Washington to suppress those suspected of supporting Al-Qaeda in Yemen. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Baghdad 2/13 (AFP)- The former President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, and his seven assistants caused chaos today, Monday, in the 11th session of their trial, by insulting and interrupting the judge whom they accused of bringing them to the courtroom against their will, without their defense team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Saddam Hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue dishdasha and a black jacket. As he entered, he chanted "Down with traitors! Down with traitors! Down with Bush! Long live the nation! Long live the nation! Long live the nation!" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The former president told the judge that he was forced to enter the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This was followed by a state of chaos as the defendants objected to being forced to enter the courtroom. Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's half-brother, shouted at Judge Ra'uf Rashid Abd al-Rahman, "You are devoid of "mercy" and you have none of the qualities suggested by your names. You are neither "praised" nor "compassionate." You are a military ruler. You are not a judge. We do not want to sit here in this place." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He added, "I cannot remain in this session in the absence of my lawyer." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He continued, saying that he suffers from "an incurable disease. I was medically examined by the Americans in the American camp, so you must release me to receive treatment. The law stipulates that any defendant who suffers from an incurable disease must be released. I am dying gradually. You are killing me." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> When the judge told him that the court agreed that he be examined by a medical committee, he said "If you fear God, release me so I can receive treatment while with my family. I will sign any pledge to attend the sessions. I have a case of honor here. I want to defend my honor." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> He continued, "If you think that the Baath Party needs me, you should know the Baath Party is functioning well and does not need me or anyone else. Here is its Secretary General (pointing to Saddam Hussein). He has been in prison for two years. So release me to receive treatment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The judge replied, "You have talked too much, and have consumed too much of the court's time." Barzan interrupted him saying, "I have the right to talk till tomorrow." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> After that, Barzan al-Tikriti noticed that the judge was ignoring his demand to be released, so he left his seat and sat on the floor, turning his back to the judge and ignoring the proceedings of the court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Saddam, who appeared furious and carried a Koran in his hand, insulted the judge for forcing him to attend the session. He said, "This is what agents do. God is great! Away with the disgraceful ones! I curse your mustache!" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> He added, "This is not a court, this is a game." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Saddam also told the judge, "You have no right to appoint lawyers for us in place of our own lawyers, with all due respect to them for agreeing to defend us and with all due respect to every Iraqi." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The judge explained that "The court has appointed lawyers in place of the defense team in accordance with Iraqi law after the defense lawyers boycotted the sessions." Saddam retorted, "They did not boycott the sessions, you threw them out. Some of them were even beaten in front of you." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Judge Abd al-Rahman replied, "I do not permit you to speak about political matters." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saddam interrupted him saying, "You are ignorant. What politics? You act selectively and contrary to the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The prosecution then began to recount the statements of a number of witnesses about what they had suffered at the hands of the security apparatus after being arrested in 1982. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Saddam Hussein then protested, telling the Chief Judge, "When witnesses talk about politics, it's allowed, but when Saddam Hussein and his companions talk about politics, it is forbidden." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Saddam Hussein, his former assistants, and the defense team boycotted the tenth session of the trial which was held this February 8th, after agreeing with each other after the previous session following an argument with the new judge, Ra'uf Rashid Abd al-Rahman, who took over as chief judge on the special tribunal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In a telephone call on Sunday lawyer Khalil al-Dulaymi, head of Saddam Hussein's defense team, told Agence France-Presse, "As head of the defense team, I can assure you that none of the defense team and none of the defendants will attend today's session of the trial." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Ja'far al-Musawi, the public prosecutor at the trial, stated that "The court will hold a meeting shortly before the court session to consider the possibility of forcing the defendants to attend or leaving them alone if they insist on not attending." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> He believes that "If the court makes any decision it must be implemented, regardless of what the decision may be." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Saddam and his assistants have been on trial since last October in the case of the killing of 148 villagers in the Shiite village of al-Dujail in response to an attack on the former Iraqi president's convoy during his visit to the village in 1982. </seg>

<seg id="4"> After the meeting, Solana said, "As far as the European Union is concerned, we have deep respect for the Muslims, and we never wanted to hurt their feelings." He stressed, "That never was and never will be our intention." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He explained that he had conveyed this message to Ihsanoglu by phone, but he insisted on delivering it in person as well. </seg>

<seg id="6"> For his part, Ihsanoglu stressed the need for the Europeans to adopt legislation in the European Parliament, to combat "anti-Islamism." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Moussa said, "This is not the era of conflict between the East and the West. We Muslims who desire positive relations should join hands with our brothers in Europe and America who share this view -- and they are many -- to extinguish this evil spark. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Iran Stresses that it Will Resume Uranium Enrichment Process) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Siyafush Ghazi </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tehran, 2/14 (AFP) - Tehran stressed today, Tuesday, that it had resumed uranium enrichment in the Natanz plant, refusing to suspend its "research" in this field, while the western nations made the resumption of negotiations with Tehran about its nuclear program contingent upon stopping this activity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Jawad Waidi, a member of the Supreme National Security Council, and the head of the nuclear program, declared that "work has begun" in the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz (in the middle of). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Monday Tehran announced that the seals and the monitoring cameras belonging to the International Atomic Energy Agency in the Natanz plant had been removed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Diplomatic sources in Vienna, the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency, today announced that Iran had resumed enrichment activities at this site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But Waidi refused to comment on the statements which claimed that the Iranians had begun the enrichment process on their own by pumping uranium hexafluoride gas into the centrifuges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He told journalists after a speech he made before the Students' Islamic Society of Tehran, "I cannot reply concerning these technical matters." He stressed that it is "unacceptable for us to stop our research" since "the essence of the nuclear program is enrichment" of uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The resumption of the enrichment process is what resulted in the breakdown in discussions with the Europeans last August, and then again in January after they had been resumed in December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> On February 4th these countries adopted the decision in the International Atomic Energy Agency demanding that Iran suspend all its sensitive activities. It brought the Iranian file to the attention of the UN Security Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But instead of complying, Tehran responded by declaring an end to the enhanced monitoring system installed by the International Atomic Energy Agency over its nuclear program and the resumption of all activities that had been suspended, particularly those related to the enrichment process on a broad scale. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Natanz plant includes two enrichment units, one for a project focusing on research, the other for an industrial facility that is still under construction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Concerning this unit, Waidi said that Iran "needs time to complete its industrial capabilities with about 60,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, but we have started our activities." He stated that his country does not see "any reason currently to re-suspend" its activities at this site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Waidi justified the series of unilateral initiatives undertaken by his country saying that "After showing good intentions over the past three years, the Europeans have demanded the total abandonment of the nuclear fuel cycle." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Europeans particularly refuse to allow Iran to  enrich uranium on its territory because they believe that this country has not proved that its nuclear program is purely civilian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The enrichment process is considered basic for obtaining fuel for nuclear power plants, but it can also be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The International Agency is expected to hold another meeting on March 6th to decide whether Iran has complied with its demands, and in all probability it will decide to refer the Iranian file to the UN Security Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the meantime, an Iranian delegation will visit Moscow on February 20th, according to Waidi, to discuss the Russian proposal for enriching Iranian uranium on its territory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> But this proposal is contingent on the position of the Iranians who are carrying out the enrichment on their territory, which is unacceptable to the western countries. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="2"> By Nasser Abu Bakr </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Ramallah (West Bank) 2/15 (AFP) -- Today, Wednesday, the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization expressed the opinion that Israeli settlement expansion is undermining opportunities for achieving peace in the region, and emphasized its full commitment to all agreements signed with the Israeli government under international auspices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A statement by the Executive Committee at the end of today's meeting at the presidential headquarters in Ramallah, chaired by the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, a copy of which was obtained by Agence France-Presse, stated that "The Executive Committee spent time discussing the settlement attack that targeted the al-Aghwar area in an Israeli attempt to isolate this area from the rest of the Palestinian territory in the West Bank under well-known security and expansionist pretexts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It stressed "its absolute rejection of the settlement plans that tear apart our Palestinian land into isolated cantons to prevent our people from establishing their independent state." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The statement added "The Executive Committee headed for the Quartet committee that issued the roadmap to declare its position regarding this creeping settlement activity on our land and the necessity of performing the role it has taken upon itself with regard to the peace process and establishing a two-state solution." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It went on to say that "The continuing settlement in noble Jerusalem, the racist separation wall, the isolation of the al-Aghwar area in an attempt to Judaize it, the crimes of assassinations, incursions, and arrests destroy any opportunity for achieving a just and permanent peace in the Middle East." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added "A decision has been made to hold the meeting of the Supreme Commission chaired by Salim al-Zanoun (Abu al-Adib), Head of the National Council, in the city of Ramallah this week to discuss the current preparations for holding a meeting of the Palestine Central Council, and to ratify plans and decisions being prepared by the Supreme Commission to make the organization, the Executive Committee, and the relevant agencies effective." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the statement, the Committee "discussed the next meeting of the Palestinian Legislative Council scheduled to be held on Saturday" stressing "full adherence to the national principles confirmed by successive Palestinian National Councils, as well as compliance with the political program of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the declaration of independence of 1988." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> It stressed "total commitment to all political agreements which have been signed with the government of Israel under international auspices, as well as its adherence to international resolutions of legitimacy related to the Palestinian issue, particularly Resolution 194 concerning the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the resolutions of the Arab Summit in Beirut." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The statement noted that "All Palestinian institutions must play their political and national role, with the legislative and executive institutions in the lead, in our desire for national gains, international recognition of the Organization and the Authority, and the higher interests of our people." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In a statement to Agence France Presse, Saleh Ra'fat, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said that "The Committee has decided to launch a broad diplomatic campaign in the Arab World and internationally, including the Security Council, the Quartet committee, and the countries that are signatories of the Geneva agreements, in order to confront the Israeli policy aiming to annex the settlement blocs and the al-Aghwar area and to draw the borders unilaterally." </seg>

<seg id="13"> He added "The Executive Committee emphasized that members of the new Legislative Council are members of the National Council. Therefore, the Hamas movement joins the Palestine National Council, which is considered the parliament of the Liberation Organization, which also qualifies it to participate in all the organization's institutions, which the Hamas movement had reservations about joining." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Strange Laws Add Novelty to England </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Jalal Malti </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London 2/17 (AFP) - England has a group of old laws and traditions, some of which are strange, and some funny, that are still effective, even if not enforced. In any case, they interest law students for their oddity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Among these laws is a law that goes back to 1279 and stipulates that "Members of Parliament are not allowed to wear armor" inside the Parliament. The purpose of this law was to avert fights and duals that would lead to killings between lords in a country of ancient democratic traditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Also among these strange laws is one prohibiting deputies from dying in Westminster Palace. If that should happen, the body must be taken out of Parliament before a death certificate is issued. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Nigel Cawthorne, the author of a book entitled, "The Strange Laws of Old England" that discusses these amazing obsolete provisions, explains that this law stemmed from the fact that Westminster Palace is a royal palace, and anyone who dies in a royal palace is entitled to an official funeral. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Members of Parliament have the right to gamble and drink alcohol freely in Westminster, the library included, while their fellow citizens are fined for such behavior by virtue of the transgressions in libraries law of 1898. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In England there are more than 4,000 national laws, 11,000 local laws, and 13,000 special laws that go back to before 1801, and they are still in effect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Cawthorne told Agence France Presse that "the tradition of law is very important" in England, explaining that "things change, but very slowly, and laws are added one after another." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> As a matter of fact, MPs have enacted legislation related to many aspects of everyday life, including the very ordinary aspects. In the 19th century, during the height of the industrial revolution, they enacted a number of laws aimed at regulating life in the suburbs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This desire led, for instance, to prohibiting hanging laundry in the streets, singing obscene songs, firing a weapon for no reason, lighting a fire in the garden, playing with kites, skating on ice, disturbing residents by knocking on their doors for no reason, turning on public lights "willfully and illegally," and other laws that have become funny today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some of these laws have not been enforced for a long time, because of the progress that has been made since they were enacted. One of the oddest is a law prohibiting riding a horse, a cow, or a motorcar when drunk (1872). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A law going back to 1867 prohibits "anyone living less than a mile from a weapons or explosives warehouse" from owning a paper toy. A law enacted in 1839 provides for punishing anyone who fires a cannon near a house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Kevin Martin, President of the law society in charge of suggesting laws that should be abolished, said that "These unusual examples portray the old history of the tradition of law in this country, and they prove the perpetual need for updating the law, and adapting it to reality." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> More than 2,000 legal provisions have been abolished since 1965 in a huge process to modernize the laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, British MPs insist on continuing to enact strange laws, such as "The Outer Space Law" of 1986 that prohibits any British citizen from "throwing an object into space" without an official permit, and defines space as including "the moon and all other heavenly bodies." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In their wisdom they authorized judges to issue orders "with the use of a reasonable amount of force" to respond to a possible attack by aliens. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Baghdad -  2/17 (AFP) -- Three days after Valentine's day, in a Friday sermon a Sunni imam attacked Valentine's day and those who celebrate it in Iraq, expressing his belief that it "lures youth away from virtue to vice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In their sermons today, Friday, most imams of mosques in Iraq focused on the photos of the abuse of detainees that go back to 2004, while others focused on the bad services and the difficult security situation in the country. However, Sheikh Mahmoud al-Sumaydii, imam of the Umm al-Qura Mosque, focused on Valentine's day which is celebrated worldwide on the 14th of this month. He expressed the belief that it has nothing to do with Islam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He said, "The international Valentine's day was two or three days ago and, unfortunately, a large number of our young men and women behaved on this day in a way that satisfied the enemy; they exchanged gifts, words, and even kisses. This is how our enemies want us to live, away from virtue." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Valentine's day is a very popular day in Iraq, as it is in the other countries around the world. Young men exchange sweets, flowers, perfume, and other gifts with their girlfriends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Al-Sumaydii added that "Every invasion has its goals. The goal of the invasion of our country is to seize our youth and lure them away from virtue to vice." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Rome, 2/17 (AFP) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi today, Friday, seven weeks before the legislative elections, signed a political agreement with the neo-fascist movement, the Social Alternative, headed by Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With Mussolini present, Berlusconi announced, "We have reached an agreement concerning the program between the House of Freedoms (the ruling coalition) and the Social Alternative," thereby expanding his electoral alliance to the extreme right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The alliance with the Social Alternative in preparation for the election scheduled for April 9th and 10th angered the rest of Berlusconi's allies because of the presence of controversial figures belonging to the neo-fascist extreme right in this formation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Berlusconi said emphatically, "our family photo album is ideal. It is  pure white." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A solution was reached when Mussolini and her two troublesome allies, Roberto Fiore, the leader of Forza Nuova (New Force), and Adriano Tilgher, the leader of the National Social Front, decided on Thursday that they would not personally be candidates on the House of Freedom Coalition lists, and proposed other nominations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Massimo D'Alema, President of the Democrats of the Left (the largest opposition party), expressed the opinion, today, Friday, that "It is a very serious matter that Berlusconi has signed agreements with the neo-fascist extreme right." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Ignazio Larussa, the Leader of the National Alliance deputies (right wing conservative, springing from the movement that is the heir to fascism), the second party in Berlusconi's coalition, emphasized that despite the withdrawal from candidacy of the Social Alternative leaders, "the fundamental problem is still in sharing basic values and the political program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Mussolini's party calls for rejecting Turkey's inclusion in the European Union and rejection of the European arrest memorandum and abortion laws. It calls for deporting immigrants and signing a new agreement with the Catholic Church, and it criticizes American Imperialism. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Muslims Most Prominent Victims of Terrorism Committed in Name of Islam (Belgian Study) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Brussels 2/17 (AFP) - A new study conducted by Belgian researchers entitled "The Development of Terrorism in 2005" reports that Muslims are the most prominent victims of terrorism committed in the name of Islam, and that international terrorism hits the Middle East more than the West. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Additionally, the study showed that 90% of the victims of international terrorism in 2005 fell in Iraq and Jordan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This study was conducted under the supervision of Rick Kulsat, Professor of International Relations at Ghent University, in western Belgium, and was published on the internet on the government website "Economy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to the study, the number of international terrorism operations was considerably less in 2005 compared to 2004. There were 266 attacks with 433 victims in 2004, compared to 393 attacks with 733 victims in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The study expressed the opinion that terrorism is not a danger of a universal nature because it is mainly concentrated in one area, the Middle East. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand, "local" terrorism committed by citizens of a state against targets in their own country witnessed a big increase between 2004 and 2005, as the number of attacks increased by 90% while the number of victims increased by 60%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The study expressed the opinion that this increase resulted almost entirely from the situation in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It also expressed the belief that "The conflict in Iraq, which has been presented as an element in the war against terrorism, has contributed to making Iraq today a center for terrorism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Relying on these figures, Rick Kulsat said in a telephone conversation, "Imagine how the Islamic world views these numbers with the West's insistence on saying that it is the one that is being threatened with terrorism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study revealed that "The notion that international terrorism represents a fundamental foreign threat is not supported by the facts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In the same context, Kulsat said, "Jihadi terrorism does not constitute the existential threat that we believe it is, even if it represents a challenge to our societies." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> This study, the second of its kind, relied on data that it obtained from the renowned institution the Rand Corporation and the National Memorial for Protection Against Terrorism and its terrorism database. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Berlusconi Faces Difficulty Dismissing Minister Accused of Insulting Islam </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Christian Spillman </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rome 2/18 (AFP) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi today, Saturday, plunged into a struggle with his allies in the Northern League to make it possible to dismiss one of their leaders, Minister of Reform Roberto Calderoli, in order to calm the tension caused in the Islamic world by his statements insulting to Islam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Prime Minister asked Calderoli to resign, emphasizing, at the same time, today, Saturday, that "he has no authority to force him" to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The minister concerned replied that he is ready to resign "if I am asked to by Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, and if the Islamic World makes an initiative to calm things down." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Italian Minister is accused of insulting Islam by wearing a cotton shirt bearing the cartoons insulting the prophet Muhammad, which caused a serious international crisis. He was wearing the cotton shirt on Thursday, and appeared with it on the evening news broadcast on Italian channel one, RAI. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This initiative of his, as well as other accusations against Islam which he made in press statements on Friday, led to violent demonstrations against Italy in Libya in which ten people were killed on Friday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Roberto Calderoli does not intend to apologize. The newspaper Corrieri della Sera  quoted him today, Saturday, saying, "I do not feel responsible for these deaths." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In a statement to the newspaper La Repubblica he emphasized "Western civilization is being intimidated." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Silvio Berlusconi shocked the Islamic world two weeks after the attacks on the United States when, on September 26, 2001, he spoke emphatically about the "superiority of Western Civilization." He has had great difficulty in correcting the ramifications of these statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Calderoli, 49 years old, a former physician who specialized in face and jaw surgery, is considered to be among the hardliners in the Northern League, a movement hostile to foreigners that is allied with Berlusconi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He joined the government in July, 2004 to replace Bossi, the Leader of the League, who was forced to resign after suffering a heart attack. The League holds three ministries: Justice, Labor, and Reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Roberto Calderoli asserted emphatically that he enjoys the support of Umberto Bossi and his party, in addition to "the support of many Italians who think like me." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He boastingly told the newspaper La Repubblica "Silvio Berlusconi has asked me to resign, but I have not resigned yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Italian authorities fear that today, Saturday, new anti-Italy demonstrations will take place in the Islamic world, not to mention reactions in Italy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Berlusconi announced that he had asked, Minister of Interior Giuseppe Pisanu to ensure that the Northern League offices are monitored. He stressed that "All protective measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Italian missions abroad." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Minister of Foreign Affairs Gianfranco Fini declared his intention to visit the mosque of Rome today, Saturday, in an attempt to calm the tension caused by Calderoli's statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> This is not the first time the Prime Minister has faced the Northern League to demand the resignation of one of its ministers from the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In July 2003, he was forced to negotiate with Umberto Bossi to dismiss Deputy Minister of Tourism Stefano Stefani, who made offensive statements about German tourists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The confrontation lasted for a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with Germany, which was primarily offended by insults made by Silvio Berlusconi personally to a German lawmaker whom he compared to a guard in a Nazi camp. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> This new crisis comes at a critical stage for the Prime Minister who is immersed in a difficult campaign within the framework of the legislative elections scheduled for April 9th and 10th. Maurizio Gasparri, one of the leaders of the National Alliance (right) said that the crisis "occurred at a time when we have begun to improve our position according to opinion polls." </seg>

<seg id="1"> With Events: Solana Between his Mind and his Heart. By Nur al-Din Ashur </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The question brought about by the current tour of the European Union's Foreign Policy Coordinator, Javier Solana, is not about its odds of success so much as it is about whether Solana was ruled by his mind or his heart to volunteer to attempt to calm the Islamic public opinion after the publication by many European newspapers of the offensive cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Now that Solana is in the Middle East, he seems to have listened to his heart after being upset by the publication of the drawings, and he felt what the Muslims felt about the insult they suffered in the name of freedom of expression, since he did not hesitate to declare that "As far as the European Union is concerned, we have deep respect for the Muslims .. </seg>
<seg id="4"> .. and we would never want to hurt their feelings." </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is part of what the European official said after his recent meeting with the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If the coordinator of European foreign policy had opted to listen to his mind (and this is purely hypothetical), he would have spared himself the trouble of going to the Middle East, whether to apologize or to "convince," and the crisis would have been settled within a European framework since Denmark is a member in the European Union, and its economic interests are being threatened .. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Does it make sense for a certain party to rush to the offended party to calm him down and make it easier for him before condemning the offender, and making him understand that what he had done is unacceptable? </seg>
<seg id="8"> During World War II, was Hitler left free to implement his aggressive plans and racist ideas while the allied countries were content to console the European nations, including the Jews? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The most dangerous aspect of the matter is that there are attempts to convince the Muslims of the correctness of the European attitude which still has not discarded the pretext of freedom of expression in the context of publishing the drawings. So that does not solve the crisis. Instead there are people who pay with their lives the price for objecting to the drawings. As a result, Europe succeeded in achieving two things. First, it diluted the question, keeping it within the context of freedom of publication. Second, it exported the crisis to the Islamic countries where it was simplified into acts of chaos and violence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, Solana's mere transformation into a man of good intentions towards the Islamic world indicates that the European Union has not yet grasped the feelings of the Muslims, who do not reject freedom of expression, but do not want it to be a means of spreading hate and violation of religious feelings. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When we will hear about the enactment of a European law, then an international law, criminalizing opposition to religions and the violation of things that are sacred, Solana's endeavors will really be worthy of praise. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Lakhdar Ibrahimi and Iraq's Mandela by Asiya al-'Atrus </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Because recognition of failure and admitting defeat have never been easy terms to find their way in the lexicon of international diplomacy in general, and Arab diplomacy in particular, especially when it comes to the war in Iraq, and its events, accompanying circumstances, and clandestine actions that may not be revealed until a long period of time has elapsed, what was stated by the veteran Algerian politician Lakhdar Ibrahimi regarding his impossible mission in Iraq cannot pass without notice or without calling for contemplation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Because Lakhdar Ibrahimi is also virtually the only Arab Maghrebi diplomat who consented to venture so closely and undertake a mission that is not free of risks both to himself and to his career, by moving to an Arab country that suffers occupation and destruction, it was very natural, under the most serious recent circumstances witnessed by the Iraqi arena in the past two and a half years, that his mission will give rise to a great deal of controversy about the reasons and motives that might impel a man with Ibrahimi's weight and experience to accept a role under the administration of the American occupation, which has been evident in his positions from the beginning, as he did not hesitate to admit that the decision of war was made outside the framework of international legitimacy. Lakhdar Ibrahimi linked the success of his mission in South Africa during the apartheid era to the presence of a leader like Mandela who was capable of establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and uniting his people around him to realize a dream that had seemed impossible a few years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> There is no doubt that when Ibrahimi, the former advisor to the United Nations Secretary General, who has had a considerable career in various areas of diplomatic activity, and has made efforts in many crises in the developing countries, acknowledges the failure of his mission and specifies the reasons and the types of mistakes he made, without any twitching or dying delusions, he sheds the image of the stubborn and obstinate diplomat who is aware of being wrong but refuses to admit it and insists on continuing the way of making mistakes because his pride and arrogance prevent him from doing that despite his conviction of the repercussions and dangers that can result as a consequence. </seg>
<seg id="5"> . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In an interview with an Arabic newspaper, Ibrahimi admitted his failure in his mission in Iraq, which he described as impossible under the various kinds of vetoes that he faced while carrying out his mission. Ibrahimi, who was, and still is, known as Mission Impossible Man, did not deny the embarrassment he feels for having agreed to work with the occupation authorities in Iraq, and under such thorny circumstances, claiming at the same time that what impelled him to accept this task was the American Administration's assurances that it was trying to end the occupation in the shortest time possible, which turned out not to be true, after it became clear that all the American Administration is interested in is not finding a solution to the current situation in Iraq as much as finding a  solution to the problem that it had created for itself in Iraq, especially before the American public opinion which has come to realize that the reasons which the administration in the White House used to justify the war were illusory and based on false reports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Perhaps the reasons that made Ibrahimi admit his failure are not limited to a single reason but rather they are connected to a series of reasons, the most important of which is his realization that occupation, wherever it is, produces resistance, and resistance produces oppression, torture, and secret prisons, and that in any case the military option can not be the solution that is required in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Ibrahimi's admissions reflect a reality of Iraq for many months, not only in the amount of material losses, and the effects of demolition and destruction, but more importantly in the amount of human losses, the psychological trauma, destruction, and homelessness, while the absence of an influential national figure capable of rallying the Iraqis and uniting them is still a very important matter in helping to emerge from the current situation and to overcome the challenges of the coming phase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> So is it possible after such long suffering of the Iraqis to reconsider the wrong policy in Iraq, to save whatever can be saved, and give the Iraqis a chance to regain their sovereignty, far from any sort of guardianship and imported solutions in cans of democracy? </seg>

<seg id="2"> By Kamal ibn Yunis </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tunisia - Morning - After the Hamas Movement won a majority in the Palestinian parliamentary elections pressure increased on the American Administration to convince it to give up its projects which call for political and economic reform in the vast Middle East -- that is, in the Arab and Islamic world extending from Morocco to Indonesia -- so that the "radical movement" hostile to Washington and the West will not benefit from these elections .. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Especially since all American and European opinion polls </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> indicate a likely increase in feelings of opposition to the policies of the United States and the Atlantic capitals among Arab and Islamic public opinion because of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the bias of the U.S. administration and the majority of Western governments towards Sharon's government during its campaign of repression against the Palestinian people and their leaders over the past five years .. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the British newspaper Financial Times, the administration of American President George Bush is currently reconsidering its declared plans to spread democracy in the Middle East region after the overwhelming victory of the Islamic Hamas movement in the latest Palestinian legislative elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The newspaper reported that the "neo-conservatives" close to the American President have started to reconsider their plans for spreading democracy in the Middle East after the overwhelming victory of the Hamas movement." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added that since the results of these elections became known the Bush administration has been bombarded with "a flood of reports and studies advising it to deliberate and slow down the matter of spreading democracy in the Middle East." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Discontinuation of Pressuring Regimes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Many recommendations have also been issued by the conservative research centers and think tanks that support the Republican administration in the White House, calling upon it "not to exert pressure on the Arab regimes" and to stop supporting the "approach of imposing the model of spreading democracy in Eastern Europe on countries of the Islamic region." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Advocates of the position opposed to the democratization of the Arab Islamic region link the Hamas victory with the electoral gains made by the extremist movement in the Iranian elections, and the winning of five seats in the parliament by Muslim Brotherhood candidates for the first time in Egypt .. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Security and Military Alliance </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the Financial Times and numerous European and American sources, "despite the criticisms directed by the administration towards the Egyptian regime because of its violations of law during the last legislative elections," the U.S. budget for 2007 is expected to see an increase in the amount of military and security aid given by Washington to Cairo as "an important ally in the war against terrorism."  .. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In other words, the priority of Washington and its European allies will be security related rather than political. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Hamas's Alliance with Washington's Adversaries </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> This controversy that is continuing in the European and American media is aggravated by numerous issues, among them the following: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> * The support of the Hamas movement (and its upcoming government) by some countries considered as major adversaries by Washington and some European capitals, particularly Syria, Iran, Sudan, Russia, Venezuela, and the list may go on to include other countries like Cuba, Korea, China, and a number of Arab and Islamic countries .. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> * The objective alliance between Tehran, Moscow, Beijing, and many European and Asian countries against the option of imposing sanctions on Iran because of the Iranian nuclear issue .. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Tehran's foreign policy after the victory of Ahmedinejad and the weakening of the moderate reformist movement headed by Mohammad Khatami and his former Minister of Culture Mohajerani .. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> * The loss by most of Washington's liberal and secular allies in the Iraqi elections .. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The focus of the struggle on the elections, the political game, and the Iraqi security battles between Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish movements, parties, and groups who have many incompatibilities but the great majority of which have a religious nature .. </seg>
<seg id="22"> and do not differentiate between religion and politics .. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> * The continuing security disturbances and continuous suicide attacks against the American and the allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan (thousands of Americans dead and wounded in 2005 alone), and against Israeli targets in occupied Palestine .. </seg>
<seg id="24"> despite the projects supporting reform and democracy adopted by President Bush's administration for years .. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This means that these projects have so far not helped in improving the point of view of popular public opinion and that of the radical movements in the "vast Middle East" towards Washington and its policies in the region .. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Decisions of Georgia and Istanbul Summits </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It might still be premature to expect Washington to finally relinquish its great project -- adopted as well by the Group of Eight at the Georgia Summit and the Atlantic Alliance Summit in Istanbul in 2004 -- which aims at repeating the Eastern Europe scenario in the Arab Islamic World .. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But many indications reveal the reluctance of many American and European decision makers to keep on supporting the "democratic reform" project .. </seg>
<seg id="29"> if such democracy will produce forces hostile to the strategic interests of Washington and its allies in the region .. </seg>
<seg id="30"> and in the whole world .. </seg>
<seg id="31"> starting with Israel's interests .. </seg>
<seg id="32"> If this reluctance continues, Washington's priority, and that of its allies will again be security and military, and not political .. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Despite the frequent declarations made by President Bush junior and his former Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and his current Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, which express the belief that among the reasons for the prominence of terrorist movements antagonistic to America and the West is its support over the past 60 years for the security option at the expense of freedom and democracy .. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Tunis - Morning - Mr. Othman Ben Arfa, CEO of the Societe Tunisienne d' Electricite et de Gaz, said that for the mid-term and the long-term -- that is, within the next two decades -- our country needs to generate and produce electricity through investment in nuclear energy, which is considered to be among the best alternative energy solutions, is not </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> expensive, and is currently available, in light of the increased cost of fuel all over the world. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At a presentation about the company's strategy for ensuring the country's energy needs before members of the Parliamentary Economic and Financial Committee, with representatives from the National Agency for Energy Control in attendance, the CEO of STEG declared yesterday at the corporate headquarters in the capital, that soon, and at the highest level, a study will be made of the possible solutions for dealing with the problem of the recurring external attacks on the company's electricity and gas network that cost millions of dinars in annual losses, and are the cause of 50% of electrical failures in Greater Tunis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At this meeting which was attended by Mr. Ezzeddin Khalafallah, General Manager of the National Energy Agency, Mr. Othman Ben Arfa highlighted STEG's future programs in the field of electric and gas energy production, and also discussed numerous issues related to services offered to customers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In his speech about available future possibilities in the field of alternative energy, he said that in addition to more work to exploit solar power and wind power, nuclear energy is considered the most important alternative energy that can be used to produce electricity, particularly since the Tunisian electricity network is capable of absorbing and transferring the huge electrical power that can be produced by nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He explained that with regard to this Tunisia had submitted its application on the subject of nuclear energy utilization for peaceful uses to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency during his earlier visit to our country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the presentation devoted to the company's future programs, it was mentioned that during 2005 STEG was able to achieve a total energy savings equivalent to about 156,600 tons of petroleum, worth 29 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="9"> During the next phase, work will be done to extend the natural gas network to new areas and connect 50,000 new subscribers to the network. This will be done within the framework of a program that will be implemented from 2005 to 2009 to raise the number of subscribers to the network to more than 400,000, which will make it possible to save government subsidies of about 92 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The company will also work in the future to reduce the import of gas packaged in cylinders by expanding the Gabes gas production and transfer plant, which will provide an annual profit of about 15 million dinars. It will improve quality and billing services based on the latest technologies such as the internet and monthly deductions to pay for consumption, in which 70,000 subscribers are currently enrolled, or by means of pre-paid cards on which reliance may increase in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Saving 1.25 Million Petroleum-Equivalent Tons </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The most prominent aspect in the presentation submitted by the General Manager of the National Agency for Energy Control was the content of the three- part program for energy control during the 2005-2008 period through which a total energy savings of about 1.25 million petroleum-equivalent tons will be achieved, and state subsidies of 220 million dinars will be avoided in exchange for a 70 million dinars account balance. </seg>
<seg id="13"> With regard to heating water with solar energy, in 2005 22,000 square meters were installed, and five suppliers and 237 installation companies in the field were authorized. This will make it possible to attain total savings of 1600 PET annually, and avoid government subsidies of about 516,000 dinars annually. </seg>
<seg id="14"> During the same period, 84 natural gas companies were connected, which will make it possible to replace a total of 100,000 PET annually of subsidized petroleum products, and avoid government subsidies of about 7.6 million dinars annually. </seg>
<seg id="15"> By 2008, 220,000 homes are scheduled to be connected to the natural gas network, and the use of energy-saving equipment will be universally available with the installation of about 8,000 voltage regulators in the old lighting networks, which will make it possible to save 30% of the total annual cost of consumption for municipalities, or about 7 million dinars annually. </seg>
<seg id="16"> An energy control program will be made universally available for all electrical household appliances, starting with refrigerators, and the sale of the types that consume the most energy -- categories 8, 7, 6, and 5 -- will gradually be prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="17"> With regard to the utilization of wind energy, 160 megawatts will be installed by STEG through the phase one expansion of the wind station at Sidi Daoud. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In the field of scientific research, eight research projects have been developed in the field of energy control with the participation of 20 laboratories, 12 organizations, and 200 researchers from various scientific research institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Energy-Saving Lamps Month </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Through the same program, three million energy-saving lamps will be installed from 2005 to 2008, which will make it possible to save 136 PET of energy and avoid subsidies of 12 million dinars. So far one international request for proposal for the acquisition of two million lamps has been sent out, with the possibility of supplying the market through the local industry with about 400,000 lamps each month for a price of not more than 4,500 millimes per lamp. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> With regard to recent developments in awareness and sensitivity, the energy-saving lamps month has been organized to run from the 10th to the 10th of next March. It will have a multimedia advertising campaign promoting locally manufactured energy-saving lamps, and setting a uniform price to the public in all areas ranging from 2,860 millimes to 4,445 millimes, depending on the brand. It is expected that 400,000 lamps will be provided during the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="22"> During the current year, television, radio, newspaper, and field campaigns will be continued, along with organizing six sector-related seminars in cooperation with the concerned ministries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It is noteworthy that the meeting included a thorough discussion between the committee members, STEG officials, and the National Agency for Energy Control. There was an opportunity for the delegates to make some inquiries and suggestions, and a number of them expressed their admiration for the important data presented by the two giants on the future programs in the field of energy control. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In particular, the development which STEG is witnessing on all levels has made it a shining pioneer both locally and internationally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> It is also noteworthy in the same context that 43 of STEG's branches all over the republic will soon get international certification for quality. </seg>

<seg id="1"> This Year's Food Trade Balance: Towards Achieving 197 Million Dinars Surplus </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunisia -- Morning -- Preliminary expectations for this year's food trade balance indicate that exports will increase by 15.6% to reach 1,187 million dinars compared to 1,027 million dinars for 2005, according to the economic balance sheet for farming and sea fishing for 2006, thereby achieving a surplus of 197 million dinars of exports over imports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This improvement is mainly due to the expected increase in exports of olive oil that are expected to reach about 600 million dinars this year compared to 476 million dinars last year, an increase of 26%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As far as all other products are concerned, compared with last year their revenues are expected to increase from 13% for prunes, since the French market absorbs the bulk of the exported quantities, or 99.8%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the same context 241 tons of prunes were exported last year for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is in addition to the positive development which the date sector is expected to witness this year, 4.4%, taking into account that last year's date exports amounted to 45,000 tons with a value of 114 million dinars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Exports of seafood products are also expected to witness this year an increase of 2.9% to reach 18,500 tons. It should be noted that 18,000 tons of seafood products with a value of 175 million dinars were exported in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> With regard to imports, this year is expected to see stability in their total value of about 990 million dinars, which is almost the same as in 2005 at around 992 million dinars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The value of grain imports is expected to record an increase of 13% to 439 million dinars, compared to 338 million dinars last year. This is due to reduction in production in this area to 1.8 million tons after registering 2.1 million tons last year, according to the economic balance sheet, while imports of other products will register a reduction according to the same source. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The talk about the presence of Al Qaeda groups in Lebanon is linked to the arrest by Lebanese Security Forces of a number of people who believe in this movement and established groups in the country. Investigations have revealed that some of them were preparing military actions. </seg>
<seg id="2"> But the most important part of this is the information that continues to circulate linking a group arrested in Beirut to the assassination of the martyred President Rafik Hariri. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Investigations of members of two Salafist groups presumably affiliated with Al Qaeda are continuing ((%pw)). They are currently under arrest by the security forces and the Lebanese judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The first group consists of five people, four Lebanese and a Syrian known as Abu Qatada. They were arrested in the northern town of ((Brayeh)). Information indicates that they were in Iraq and were detained for about six months by the American Forces. One of them had both his legs amputated after a mine explosion. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The second group was arrested in Beirut and consists of 13 people of various Arab nationalities. They had in their possession weapons and forged citizenship documents and they address each other using pseudonyms. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to security sources they are: </seg>
<seg id="7"> 1. The leader of the group, Hasan Muhammad Nabaa, who participated in the events of ((al-Dinniyah)) in 2000 and fled to Syria. He joined his brother in Sunday's demonstration. </seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. Amir Abdallah Hallaq, a Palestinian mechanical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="9"> 3. Hani Hashim al-Shanti, a naturalized computer engineer of Palestinian origin. </seg>
<seg id="10"> 4. Hamad Turki ((al-Rabei)), a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="11"> 5. Muhammad Abd al-Razzaq Wafai, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="12"> 6. Faysal Asaad Akbar, a Saudi citizen. He entered Lebanon with a forged passport under the name Fahd Muhammad al-Khadim al-Yamani. He fought side by side with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and then moved to Syria. </seg>
<seg id="13"> 7. Muhammad Ahmad Kujah, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="14"> 8. Tariq al-Nasir, a Syrian neurosurgeon. He accompanied some of these elements to Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 9. Ali Jihad Sharaf al-Din, a Lebanese minor. He was responsible for transporting explosives. </seg>
<seg id="16"> 10. Khidr Muhammad Naba, a Lebanese. </seg>
<seg id="17"> 11. Malik Muhammad Nabaa. He was responsible for collecting explosive bags and devices. </seg>
<seg id="18"> 12. Bara' Muhammad Fuad, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 13. Muadh Abd al-Ghani Shushah, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Information indicates that all of them are in contact with a Syrian from Homs known as Jamil, who is an expert in electrical engineering, explosives, and booby traps. He provided money and weapons to fighters heading for Iraq. This information also revealed that the two most dangerous members of this group, Khalid Taha and Bilal Zaarura, entered Lebanon from Syria last December and are presumed to be in the Ayn al-Hilwah camp. They were never arrested. </seg>
<seg id="21"> From the interrogation of the members of this group much information has been weaved together about its involvement in the assassination of President Rafik Hariri. The International Investigations Committee and the Americans have asked to see this information which might have been seen by a high level judicial authority. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The members of this group are still being held by the Information Branch of the Internal Security Forces who accompany them to the military investigating magistrate to continue interrogating them about the charge of attempting to carry out terrorist operations. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, the way this issue is being handled suggests that there is internal information related to the assassination. But the judicial sources do not confirm this information because they don't have any material evidence and refer to it as political talk aimed at moving the accusations from one place to another. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Hezbollah, which %pw refrained from participating in Sunday's demonstration, benefited from the spectacle of riot and disorder by presenting today a contrary image through an organized and disciplined rally of hundreds of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition to the point of organization and discipline, the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, supported by the impetus of a meeting with General Aoun in Mar Mikhail, rushed to politically attack those whom he called the current authority caretakers, calling upon them to turn over the facts produced by the recent developments, accusing some of those managing the country of contributing to the intensification of political and sectarian tensions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nasrallah, who is feeling renewed political comfort, is ready with a prioritized agenda for the next phase. The most important thing is a call to those who want to go to war with Syria or against Syria to take advantage of their party, group, or community. But, according to Nasrallah, they should not drag the government, the state, or its institutions into a war of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, hours after Hezbollah's political and public protest, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora attempted to monitor the disastrous consequences of last Sunday by hosting a spiritual summit conference that is being held right now in the Grand Palace. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For more details we have this live report from our colleague Denise Rahmy Fakhry. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Good evening Denise. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Good evening George. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Yes, at this time the summit has not yet begun, but it will begin, I mean, in a few moments. We are waiting for the arrival of all the personalities and sectarian leaders who are participating in this summit conference at the Grand Palace hosted by the Prime Minister %pw, excuse me, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So, uh, some of, uh, the sectarian leaders participating are: Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir; the Mufti of the Republic of Lebanon, Muhammad Rashid Qabbani; the Vice President of the Higher Shiite Islamic Council Sheikh Abd all-Majid Qablan; Patriarch Gregorius III Lahham, Roman Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and the rest of the East, including Alexandria and Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also participating were Armenian Catholic Patriarch Nerses Bedros XIX and Dr. Salim Sahyouni, President of the Supreme Council of the Evangelical Community in Syria and Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also participating were Archbishop Elias Awdeh, Archbishop Boulos Mattar, Archbishop Kegham Khatcherian, as well as Archbishop Roland Abu Jawdeh. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Representing the Druze sect Judge Nihad Hreiz is participating. Also participating are: Archbishop Narsai Baz, Archbishop %pw Mar Athanasius Afram Barsoum -- I apologize if I am mispronouncing the name; Archbishop Michel Qasarji, Archbishop Boulos Tehdah, Monsieur George al-Masri, Archbishop Andre Haddad, and Pastor uh Bishawi, the leader of the holy sect in Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So these are the names of those participating in this spiritual meeting or as George described it, the spiritual summit. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We also learned that during this summit conference %pw Prime Minister Fouad Siniora will deliver an important speech. He refused to reveal its contents prior to reading it to the attendees. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We have also learned that following the meeting Prime Minister Siniora will host an evening banquet in honor of all the sectarian leaders participating today in this meeting at the Grand Palace. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Mar Maroun Church in Gemayzeh, which was subject to riots last Sunday, today celebrated Saint Maroun's Day in an official mass celebration which brought together Lebanese factions, foremost among them President Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, and a representative of President Berri. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This year's Mar Maroun Day celebration comes at a time when Lebanon is going through difficult circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The holiday brought together all the spiritual families of Lebanon at Mar Maroun Church in Gemayzeh. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Among the attendees was President General Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, and member of parliament Abd al-Latif al-Zayn, representing the Speaker of the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A large number of ministers, members of parliament, political, trade union, social, media, and spiritual figures also participated in the divine sacrifice, as well as ambassadors of major foreign countries. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The sacrifice was led by Archbishop Boulos Matar who stressed that the tradition of gathering in the Mar Maroun Church in Beirut for prayers goes back three quarters of a century, and that its continuance is only an indication of the love that binds the Lebanese despite their differences. </seg>
<seg id="7"> What is needed today is love and not mistrust and hostility that do not build anything. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The security we lacked in our capital for hours, and the sense people got that they were without a roof to protect them, their livelihood, and their sacred things makes us strongly question what we have been trying to prove for the past 30 years during which we almost lost everything and we shed a huge amount of blood and tears in the hope that we as well as our generations would witness a bright tomorrow in a secure, stable, and completely sovereign homeland, and a just and strong state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Is it reasonable for us to wait longer? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Archbishop Matar stressed the need for ongoing dialogue through consultation with people and multiple opinions to find the best solutions for the majority of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But the majority should not gather people on the basis of their religious or other affiliations, but rather on the basis of their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It should move with the transfer of power from one side to another without embarrassment to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The game of free minds, hearts, and wills increases in value when the group's enlightenment, rationality, and practice of its freedoms increase. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is without doubt the soundest basis for determining what is good for the group because everyone participates in the search and the decision making. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It also ordains that the majority -- any majority -- must take into consideration the opinion of the minority and unification rather than antagonism. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On this occasion prayers were held for establishing love and peace all over Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In ((Bkirki)) Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Sfeir stressed in his holiday sermon how much solidarity is needed during these cruel times in Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We celebrate today the holiday of Saint Maroun, the father of our Maronite Church. The best way to celebrate saints is to emulate the way they lived their lives. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The words of the Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Sfeir. </seg>
<seg id="20"> While leading the celebratory mass at the church of the patriarchal palace on the occasion of the celebration of the holiday of Mar Maroun, there was an opportunity to call attention to Saint Maroun's life, which was marked by giving, prayer, asceticism, and fighting the temptations and vanities of the world. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Cardinal Sfeir called upon the Lebanese to unite in these cruel times. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We express our deepest sorrow over the vandalism, destruction, and violations during last Sunday's events in the capital Beirut which were intended to ignite discord. Thank God the citizens knew how to protect themselves from greed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We congratulate our Maronite brothers and sons on this holiday, here and in the nearby and distant diaspora, and we call upon all of them to emulate the virtues of this saint, especially his traits of fear of God, renunciation of earthly vanities, and love of people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> He seemed to say that in the presence of God we are worthless slaves, Amen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> After the celebratory mass on the holiday of Mar Maroun, the congregation and well-wishers moved to the patriarchal palace, where Cardinal Sfeir received the representative of the French ambassador, Francois Abi Saad </seg>
<seg id="26"> The secretary of a delegation of Maronite clerical graduates in Ghadir spoke as well. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The circumstances are extremely difficult. What this nation needs is obvious, but there are some who don't want its citizens to have comfort. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But we have to close ranks with each other and realize that in unity there is strength while in division there is weakness. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The international attempts to cordon off Hamas after its victory in the Palestinian legislative elections, were violated by Russia in an attention grabbing position.

<seg id="3"> Dr. Samir Geagea stressed that the consultation and search for a candidate acceptable to all would continue, to avoid an electoral battle in Baabda Aley. </seg>
<seg id="4"> ((The words)) of the chairman of the Lebanese Forces executive committee was during a meeting with Forces cadres in the Aley area within the framework of regular preparatory meetings for restructuring the Lebanese Forces Party. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At present we are pursuing a very serious attempt to find a candidate to avoid an electoral battle, despite the fact that it is a democratic battle, and to find a candidate agreeable to all parties. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Now, a candidate satisfactory to all concerned parties ((has reached you)). Of course we respect all concerned parties, particularly the Free Patriotic Movement. A candidate acceptable to all requires us to discuss behind closed doors all of the names, proposed and not proposed. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Proposed and not proposed until we both find a name acceptable to both sides. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This for us will constitute agreement. We will sit down together and suggest one or two names, or three, or five, or ten. We might possibly reach ((as many as)) 15 or 20 names until we find a name among them that is satisfactory to us as well as the rest of the parties concerned with the battle. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This is what we are trying to do right now putting all our weight into it and decisively focusing on it. We are trying to find him. </seg>

<seg id="11"> Dr. Geagea also touched on two key issues currently debated on the political front. They are the issue of the economic situation and the need to find a real solution that can be implemented. The second issue is the policy of patience and the self restraint that the Lebanese Forces is calling for in the wake of the recent events. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Today we have courageously entered the war. And we want to tackle peace with same courage that we entered the war. Peace requires much greater courage than war. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is not a matter of manhood the way we know it. At times self restraint and calm require much more courage than pulling the trigger and shooting. </seg>
<seg id="14"> ((Anyone can shoot)), but not everyone can restrain himself ((from shooting)). Some are criticizing us for ignoring the social and economic conditions and pursuing politics. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The answer to that is, it is impossible to think about any serious economic or social solutions outside the realm of the establishment of an actual strong state. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You can't just think of a solution. You can gather all the world's experts to give all imaginable solutions, but these solutions need someone to implement them. Who is going to implement them? They need an actual state to implement them. We still do not have this actual state. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be noted that the chairman of the Lebanese Forces executive committee met at his headquarters in al-Arz with British Ambassador James Watt for an hour. The British Ambassador did not make any statement. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Uh, before we continue bringing you the news I want to apologize for an error at the beginning of the report concerning the position of Dr. Samir Geagea, who stressed that the Forces will tackle peace with same courage that it entered the war.

<seg id="14"> The extension for President Lahoud was coerced in the sense that the intelligence service ((picked up the representatives)), threatened them, and told them, "you have to sign the extension law." While the electoral law of 2000 was proposed in the parliament another law, the law of 60, was proposed, and after negotiations they reached a political settlement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Once again I repeat the intelligence service did not pick up representatives and tell them "You must sign the 2000 law." No. There was a political settlement based on everybody's ((need)) to hold the elections on time. Okay. ((The country will have a constitutional void)). </seg>
<seg id="16"> Based on uh President Berri using his post to pass the 2000 law because it was ((how))? It was the most appropriate law so the parties were compelled to reach a political settlement. Of course the political settlement is one thing, and coerced extension -- in other words %pw -- because force and compulsion are something completely different. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So the 2000 law that we of course do not agree to was passed based on a %pw political settlement reached at the time based on the prevailing circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Representative Boutros Harb expressed the opinion that Resolution 1559 put the president in an illegal position, and he found the call by General Michel Aoun for early elections odd. </seg>
<seg id="19"> &gt; Representative Boutros Harb says that the Christmas message he sent (()) to the President of the Republic, General Emile Lahoud, was interpreted by President Lahoud as support for him. When he did not take a decision to step down the March 14th Forces had to look seriously into the issue of the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Uh, of course we hope that the president realizes the seriousness of the situation and its very negative consequences on the Lebanese front if he stays where he is. %pw He is inflicting great harm to the presidency, to say nothing of the harm he is suffering personally. I mean, the president, because any debate, any debate we watch on the television is %pw, is %pw, is in fact using offensive and insulting language. Furthermore, the position of the presidency has become absent %pw, absent, I mean, it does not exist in the political life except for statements that respond to someone or someone else. Of course this is further hurting the presidency uh, as well as his negative positions in rejecting laws passed by the parliament regardless of whether he has the right to do so or not. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Harb pointed out several means to address the issue of the presidency. There are both constitutional and legal aspects, and there is political and public action. </seg>
<seg id="22"> ((Sheikh)), can you tell us which constitutional and legal mechanism you are relying on? Will you rely on the text of 1559, the ((Larsen)) and ((Mehlis)) reports? What will you rely on, I mean, to remove the president? </seg>
<seg id="23"> 1556 provided for the necessity of holding free presidential elections respecting the constitutional provisions. </seg>
<seg id="24"> What happened during the elections is that the next day a decision was issued that totally contradicted %pw %pw, one of the articles of this resolution. This means that internationally the presence of the president of the republic is in violation of 1556, and contradicts the international trend and international legitimacy. This of course is a very big opening that can be dealt with politically in a way that would result in placing the president of the republic in an illegitimate position in relation to the international community. Therefore, it will be dealt with on this basis. But this has so far not happened. In fact, we don't want that to happen because we think that we will reach this attempt. Therefore, we want the president of the republic to take the initiative, because the fact is that he is not begrudged, I mean. </seg>
<seg id="25"> ((Sheikh)) But %pw General Aoun, I mean the one who opposed the extension and opposed the president of the republic is now opposed to removing the president, and instead of calling for presidential elections is calling for early parliamentary elections. How do you respond to this statement? </seg>
<seg id="26"> %pw What is the goal of the elections? </seg>
<seg id="27"> That we restore %pw </seg>
<seg id="28"> I mean the outcome might be different than the current political structure. %pw So-and-so might gain more while someone else might lose. This is not what we need. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We need to benefit from the international support for ((Lebanon)) and the existing national circumstances that became clear yesterday, February 14th. This, this national intermarriage is happening for the first time in Lebanon's history ((for females who were born)) in Lebanon first ((for females who were born)) in Lebanon, one free independent sovereign, I mean, the history of Lebanon is witnessing a new way of operating and it would be a shame to let it pass by (()). </seg>
<seg id="30"> The country is not short of men. </seg>
<seg id="31"> None of us can claim that he is the only suitable person and all the others are not suitable. </seg>
<seg id="32"> There are many good people in Lebanon and there are people who consent to us negotiating on their behalf. </seg>
<seg id="33"> What we are concerned with are Lebanon's interests, that no one of us should negotiate Lebanon's security. We all have to forgo our personal demands and forgo our affiliations. On the contrary, let us make every effort to agree on someone who supports our common project for building a modern state and establishing sovereignty and independence, and reasserting the authority of the state over all of Lebanon. This is the project that we must pursue. Let us not pursue individual projects. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Regarding the presidency, Harb believes that the individual is not important, but rather the project and the history of the individual, as well as his aspirations and his ability to interact positively with all the forces. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Today, Monday, he urged calm in the midst of the increasing controversy over the drawings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Interfax News Agency mentioned that Konstantín Kosachiov, Head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Russian Parliament, the Duma, said, "We are concerned about the European actions, not just in their initial stage when a news organization in one of those countries published the cartoons, but also about the actions that followed -- the republication of these drawings in several other European countries." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> 12 of the cartoons that denigrate the prophet Muhammad which were published by a Danish newspaper last September and republished in other European countries caused disturbances in the Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is because any depiction of the Prophet, whether negatively or positively, is considered blasphemy by most Muslims. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The value of individual financial deposits amounted to 14 trillion Yuan and corporate financial deposits reached 10 trillion Yuan, causing general concern in the local banking sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of The People's Bank of China (The Central Bank) said recently that the increase in the savings rate of citizens is connected with several factors such as the traditional culture, the social structure, and the concept of family in China. But the incomplete social security system is an important reason for the reluctance of citizens to spend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Zhou pointed out that the incompleteness of the social security system is a temporary phenomenon and that the government must accelerate its reform of the old-age insurance system, the medical insurance system, and education in order to reduce "precautionary savings" among citizens and to reduce the percentage between savings deposits and the amount of the Gross Domestic Product to its natural level. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Riyadh, February 13th, Xinhua -- The Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Prof. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, held talks today with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Policy and Security, Javier Solana, in the OIC headquarters in Jeddah. They discussed the ramifications of the publication by the Danish newspaper of caricatures insulting the prophet Muhammad. The talks aim at reaching a satisfactory settlement of this issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Oglu, the OIC Secretary General, first welcomed his European guest and expressed his appreciation for his visit to Jeddah in view of the current situation, when the feelings of indignation and anger have intensified all over the Islamic world in reaction to the attempts by some Western newspapers to insult Islamic things that are sacrosanct under the pretext of freedom of expression as reported by the Saudi News Agency this evening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Secretary General stated during the talks that he looked forward to cooperating with the European Union in order to overcome this crisis and to ensure that its causes are not repeated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> For his part, Solana stated that through his first visit to the headquarters of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, he wanted to send out a signal to the Islamic public opinion by expressing Europe's deep respect for Islam, to emphasize Europe's respect for the feelings of Muslims, and to demonstrate his sorrow and regret at the ramifications of the issue of the caricatures, whose publishers misjudged Muslims' feelings toward them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Solana said that "The whole issue was not justified. We understand the reactions of Muslims, who felt injustice and hurt because of them." He emphasized his sincere willingness to cooperate with the Organization of the Islamic Conference and with the Islamic states to avoid an incident such as this in the future. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He added that "today's world is full of complicated crises and that the last thing we want is a confrontation because of these drawings. We are keen to cooperate in order to make the world a safer place, and to discuss in order to arrive at the adoption of measures that can calm the situation first, and then we can consider the steps that would guarantee that such incidents will not happen again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Solana noted the spirit of cooperation he had shown. Oglu gave him a number of legal and political proposals that could guarantee that this crisis is not repeated. These proposals include: adoption by the European Union of legislative measures against Islamophobia through the European Parliament, making Islamic-European joint efforts for the adoption of a resolution by General Assembly of the United Nations similar to the recently issued resolution 60/15 regarding "Combating defamation of religions" which should prohibit defamation of all prophets and religions; adopting a code of conduct for the western media which would take into account the sensitivities of Muslims and would prohibit the defamation of all the forms, revelations, and core beliefs of religions, including mocking prophets -- all of which should be considered an ethical offence in the western media code; adopting a system of international media regulations by the United Nations which includes a definition of the extent of freedom of speech with regard to religious symbols within the framework of UNESCO; and inclusion of a provision prohibiting irreverence towards religions in the text of the resolution on establishing the new Human Rights Council. Solana welcomed these ideas and promised to cooperate with the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the European Union, and the United Nations to implement them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He also expressed his desire to hold a joint meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the European Union in continuation of the meeting that was held between the two organizations in 2002 in Istanbul which yielded positive results in facilitating mutual understanding and dialogue between the Islamic world and the West. </seg>

<seg id="7"> The source asserted that the proposal for the two-year postponement conforms with an important practical consideration which is as follows: If the local public council elections were postponed for only one year, they would coincide with the mid-term Shura Council elections, for which procedures start in April 2007. Practical considerations require that it be avoided. Based on the foregoing, the draft law was prepared so that the existing local public councils will continue for two consecutive years beyond their current term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Egyptian Shura Council also approved the postponement of local elections two days ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It should be noted that the terms of office of the currently existing local councils in Egypt would have ended next April 15th. According to the law, the elections of the local councils should have been held during the 60 days preceding the end of their term of office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The opposition parties and political powers in Egypt reject the decision of the Shura Council approving the law on postponement of the elections, accusing the governing National Democratic Party of  trying to prevent them from running for elections and marginalizes their role in the local arena. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The sources further said that Rice's talks in the region will focus on the developments of the peace process in the Middle East after the victory of the Hamas movement in the Palestinian elections, especially since Hamas so far does not have a clear position regarding the continuation of the peace process with Israel. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Baghdad, February 15th, Xinhua -- Kamran Qaradaghi, the Official Spokesman for the Iraqi President, announced that President Talabani is continuing his sponsorship of the meetings and talks which are growing more frequent day by day in order to reach a satisfactory ending to the political process in the post-election stage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At a press conference held today, Wednesday, Qaradaghi said that "President Talabani is meeting with all the major political factions, listens to their points of view, and is seeking to move their positions closer together in his capacity as the President of the Republic and the sponsor of the political process in the country, in addition to being the president of the Kurdistan Coalition Bloc." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Qaradaghi pointed out that all parliamentary blocs are talking about national agreement and are stressing that there are no red lines against any list that has won in the elections. He described this position as "a good step" and said that President Talabani was pleased with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He further stated "The president made it absolutely clear that he did not accept the matter of red lines. Even if someone is mentioning them, that does not mean that all the members of the bloc to which he belongs have the same opinion. Furthermore, al-Sayyid al-Hakim denied the existence of any red lines against the participation of any bloc in the next government." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Regarding the form of the new government, Qaradaghi said that "The political situation in the country is unique. Iraq is still in a state of war against terrorism, not to mention the poor economic situation and regional and international changes. This necessitates relying on a formula of agreement in running the country, taking into consideration the outcome of the elections." He further emphasized that Talabani is calling for putting the principle of agreement above the narrow interests of the parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He reported that the leaders of the political blocs have not yet reached the point of discussing the details of the formation of the coming government, which must be a true national unity government that includes every one, and there must be no red lines against any bloc. In the meantime, it is important to reach an agreement on a clear political program that the next government will adhere to. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gaza, February 16th, Xinhua -- Saeb Erekat, the Palestine Liberation Organization's Chief of Negotiations, today, Thursday, sent urgent letters to a number of countries requesting immediate intervention to stop Israeli plans to isolate the al-Aghwar territory and divide the West Bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A statement issued by the department to Xinhua said that the letters were sent to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State David Welch, the Representative of the UN Secretary General, Alvaro de Soto, the European Representative for the Peace Process, Marc Otte, the Russian Representative for the Peace Process, Alexander Kalugin, and several ambassadors, consuls, and representatives of the European Union, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Canada, Australia, and Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The statement noted that the letters stressed that "The continuation of attacks means dropping the choice of peace and making impossible the establishment of a Palestinian state with the June 4, 1967 borders. Furthermore, they are part of the policy of imposing facts and dictates on the ground instead of negotiations." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The statement stressed that "Isolating the al-Aghwar area means paving the way for its annexation to Israel. Such a decision constitutes a real human catastrophe because it will prevent two million Palestinians from entering the region which comprises one third of the total area of the West Bank." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The statement added that "The completion of the expansion wall and the annexation have created a racist system in the West Bank. The annexation of East Jerusalem, the isolation of al-Aghwar, the increasing settlement activities, and the continued confiscation of water reservoirs mean that the Israeli government is implementing the long term interim phase plan or the state with temporary borders in return for a long term truce." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The statement warned that "The implementation of these plans means a human, agricultural, educational, and health catastrophe for all inhabitants of the al-Aghwar area. The Israeli settlers, who number 8,000, have taken control of all the water in the al-Aghwar area as well as most of the agricultural land. They have also established industrial colonial housing complexes related to livestock." </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Why Do We Moslems Speak in High Sounding Terms When Demanding Implementation of Human Rights for Moslem Minorities In the West While We Refuse to Implement them for Christians in the Countries Where We Form the Majority? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; by Dr. Yusra Mustafa, a Moslem writer, but who is against terrorism </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If our Islamic governments, which take the religion of Islam as the source of their legislation, do not like human rights and especially the rights of minorities to perform their religious rituals, then this is something understandable. But human rights are viewed with suspicion by elites and some populist figures outside the sphere of government, this is something that requires consideration and explanation. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We have noticed during the last few years that one of the great challenges facing women's and human rights groups is integrating human rights in a culture that still does not want to acknowledge the principles of human rights and their universality. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As we know, the main basis for rejecting human rights is represented in the cultural privacy discourse, which argues that our societies have different values from the values of human rights since human rights values are of a foreign source and character. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Anyway, the dilemma of disseminating the culture of human rights exists not just because of restrictions imposed by the state. In addition to that, there is a general culture that is nourished by the cultural privacy discourse with the aim of removing legitimacy from the universal values of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, this cultural rejection is a reality that cannot be ignored, and non-government political and ideological powers are contributing to stirring it up. Better than ignoring it, we must look for its causes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I believe that the principles of human rights do not find an echo in our societies, not because these principles are western, but perhaps because they are foreign to legal and political systems which deal with human rights selectively and with double standards. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is not hidden from anyone who follows the news that human rights are not rejected in their totality, but only some of them are rejected. For example, collective rights are accepted. Although political rights annoy the government, they nevertheless find listening ears with the opposition forces, including those which promote cultural privacy. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But personal rights are the real dilemma and are the ones which stir up the cultural privacy discourse, not only with governments but also with political and ideological forces which collaborate with the authority to create a public opinion antagonistic to the universality of human rights in the name of privacy. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When we talk about the right to development, we have a collective comfortable feeling and accuse the other foreign person of exploiting us. And when we talk about the right to form parties, the opposition responds, but the government gets angry. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But when it is a matter of freedom of thought and belief or personal rights for women, the cultural privacy discourse emerges to remove legitimacy from human rights because these are considered western concepts. Consequently, the issue of cultural privacy is not used to oppose human rights in general, but in a partial, selective way, specifically when the issue is basically about personal rights and freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Thus, if we want to look for the reason which makes the principles of human rights lack cultural legitimacy in our societies, we have to start from our cultural and political position toward personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is, we have to hold the thread at the beginning by asking the preliminary question about the extent of the legitimacy of personal rights themselves before we talk about the legitimacy of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is a valuable article by the German philosopher Habermas entitled, "Towards Bestowing Legitimacy by Means of Human Rights," in which he says: New laws emerge essentially from personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These rights let a legal person to behave according to his own priorities. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus, in a very just way these rights release the person with a right from any other kind of instructions or ethical or moral commandments. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Anyway, no one is compelled legally, within what is permitted legally, to reveal his work openly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Habermas refers to the incorporation of personal freedoms into the structure of the new law. Thus, it became different from traditional legal systems. This confirms Hobbes's principle which says: everything is permitted unless it is explicitly forbidden. In this way, law is separated from ethics. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The separation of law from ethics in the new law is an important issue, not because we love law and hate ethics but because this is the modern historical logic of the principle of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This separation historically allowed basically legal individuals to be formed based on the concept of personal rights. This was in comparison with traditional systems which include basically moral individuals. These individuals are formed and controlled according to the dictates of ethical systems based on religion or on customs and traditions or even on modern political ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If the modern law is based on the concept of personal rights, then the moral discourse is based on a collective comprehensive concept of truth and duty. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, when it is a matter of the individual in our societies, we find ourselves living in a three-dimensional manner: first, we are legal persons according to historical evolution which we do not ignore. There is a law that governs us even though that law derogates public and personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Second, in terms of the civil law, religious, moral, and terrorist elements overlap: for example, personal status laws, freedom of thought and belief, or the practice of religious rights for minorities. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Third, we are persons governed, in large areas of our lives, by purely moral rules which have more power than laws, especially when related to personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Even that amount of freedom which is not restricted by law is restricted by morals, contrary to the law. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As an example, the collective religious discourse, or whatever is determined by customs and traditions, intervenes to impose on an individual lifestyles in the framework of a system of rules and moral, illegal restrictions by which the life of individuals as moral beings is regulated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some may imagine that legal rules are in constant competition with moral rules. But this is not true to a large extent. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Law and morals may meet in a positive way when both law and morals consider as criminal offenses, such as homicide and theft. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But they both meet in a negative way to restrict freedoms and personal rights. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In our societies particularly, law retreats, except in its suppressive forms, leaving its arena to moral rules, not because they compete with it but because these rules play a functional role that is in the interest of the authority, namely, the role of societal control, especially in the area of rights and personal freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Within this disciplinary formula, an alliance takes place between three powers: the political power, the religious power, and the power of customs and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Therefore, what cannot be controlled by law, can be controlled by morals; the individual will be punished even if he does not violate the law. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It must be noted that this process of control depends on moral punishments which may develop into violence. In this case individuals will be categorized not according to their commitment or non-commitment to the law, but according to a moral division following the separation between what is pure and what is impure in the elementary meaning. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The religious discourse directed to women uses moral classification. It may say that the veil is chastity and purity. Consequently, a woman who does not wear a veil will be punished culturally and socially because she is considered to have lost her legitimacy with regard to purity and chastity. </seg>
<seg id="36"> This kind of classification can also be found in political ideologies. Thus, we hear those who say, "honorable citizens," referring to the fact that anyone who does not follow this political approach is only a citizen, and if he opposes it, he may judge himself as a non-honorable citizen. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The language of chastity, purity, and honor implies a kind of illegal punishment to moral beings. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Hereby the crisis of the legitimacy of human rights emerges. The language of human rights is basically legal and humane; that is, it is designed to address legal beings that live within a political and legal system based on citizenship which acknowledges the personal rights of individuals and protects them. </seg>
<seg id="39"> But the problem, as mentioned above, is that the legal being does not have cultural legitimacy, and it is substituted by basically moral beings. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Accordingly, the human rights discourse enters a sphere foreign to its legal language and vocabulary; thus, it is treated in a selective manner whereby it accepts whatever is collective and rejects whatever is personal. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The legitimacy of human rights cannot be established unless there is collective acknowledgement that they are legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="42"> This acknowledgement will not take place if there are forces which are afraid of human rights and individuals who are not aware of the language of the law, which is the language of human rights. They are only aware of the language of morals, which is the language of political and religious authority and the authority of customs and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Hereby the importance of defending the issue of citizenship emerges, not in its capacity as an issue of tolerance and coexistence, but basically in its capacity as a project for civil rights and reconsideration of the legal character based on personal rights and freedoms. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Even Cows... Make Mistakes! </seg>
<seg id="6"> Badriya al-Abd al-Rahman </seg>
<seg id="7"> I know that my topic is the hottest on the Islamic front these days... </seg>
<seg id="8"> It may seem repetitive to many of you to talk about the Danish stupidity that mobilized the emotions of Muslims all over the world... and how it enabled us to read and calm the situation that heralded things whose consequences are not praiseworthy... </seg>
<seg id="9"> What is the story? </seg>
<seg id="10"> How can we clearly explain this exceptional behavior? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Can we for example, read it as a rude awakening of religious fanaticism, in a century marked by tolerance and anti-fanaticism? </seg>
<seg id="12"> Or is it a ruder awakening of non-religious fanaticism against religion, religions, and religious symbols? </seg>
<seg id="13"> The most astonishing thing is that it happened in a peaceful, quiet country, notably remote from worldwide decision-making. ... Or maybe its political stagnation and non involvement, (not with prejudice) and its geographical distance from areas full of cultural and intellectual clashes against Muslims in particular ... and against other cultures in general were reasons that caused the controversy... </seg>
<seg id="14"> that a spontaneous action, even if exceptional, by some magazine resulted in provoking resentment among  followers of the Islamic religion, which is embraced by millions throughout the world... </seg>
<seg id="15"> What is worse is that this provocation did not happen by way of good will or to push for discussion with the other party... rather it was to create a badge of Islamic identity on which to hang accusation and predetermined clichés about our religion... </seg>
<seg id="16"> The whole scene was a considerable Danish stupidity. I don't think that it will easily be conveyed through history... and I don't believe the country of cows and butter, with its exaggerated image of goodness and innocence needed to flex its muscles when it decided to do so by provoking Islamists and Muslims of all walks of life... </seg>
<seg id="17"> Why just Islam...? </seg>
<seg id="18"> Using the most important symbol of this religion, His noble prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)... and an impudent, perfectly stereotypical image of Islam were marketed, by describing it as a religion of bombs and death ... unconditionally ... highly unconditional ... because the function of a newspaper cartoon is to depict a real image ... that is true and undisputed, except by fools...! </seg>
<seg id="19"> Quite simply, we were sold short, and the long history of a great religion was summed up in a cartoon which insults just us, none of all the religions and intellectual trends in the world, in the name of many of which atrocities and crimes were committed against the whole world... singling out Islam on the death list... </seg>
<seg id="20"> Just like that sanctity is violated and fanaticism crosses the red line, going hundreds of meters beyond the line, without the least shame or rationale ... as if religions had become stale goods and products with no regard for what they symbolize, what they accomplish, and how they affect the souls of their adherents... </seg>
<seg id="21"> In short ... it is impoliteness and impudence according to the standard of intellectual protocol ... according to the standard of political protocol ... according to all protocols. Nothing is taken into consideration by this stupidity except that it is impolite. Afterwards, Denmark does not expect against itself any stupider behavior because of it ... because it was, in short, (more disrespectful and viler). </seg>
<seg id="22"> Misery and wretchedness from this image, not only because it is ugly and false ... but also because it awakens issues firmly set in the Western mentality for centuries against the Muslim... the Muslim associated with death, the sword, horses, and beheading for the sake of God ... and nothing more.. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Sediments that found someone to roil them to disturb the relative harmony Muslims are enjoying in the West, particularly in Denmark, because of fanatics of any intellectual background who don't realize the danger of their actions... </seg>
<seg id="24"> What did Denmark actually get itself into, by God? </seg>
<seg id="25"> How does it expect to gain our respect after all that happened? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can it secure its citizens in the Islamic countries and everywhere else after the wave of anger that swept the Muslims? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Just questions, I don't know if it dawned on the Danish mentality, public opinion, and decision makers ... or is this mentality still busy milking its cows and spreading its butter, oblivious of the serious predicament which some magazine editors dragged it into, a magazine that in the mind of every Muslim represents every Danish person...! </seg>
<seg id="28"> Let's boycott ... in order to be...! </seg>
<seg id="29"> The unified messages through cell phones and emails to boycott Danish products and smear its reputation, is a good healthy phenomenon that I support without any reservations... </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the days of boycotting American and Israeli products, the Arab Islamic mentality has been vigilant, producing its numerous and sometimes distressing "Nos," but in a beautiful, impressive way ... even if we disagree with it... </seg>
<seg id="31"> The world must comprehend that a Muslim is no longer a member of a group of nations, the majority of which are third World countries, that decided for him (without consulting him) ... Rather he became a cultured person, aware of his cultural background, which is the Islamic religion, regardless of his sect or the difference in commitment to the religious regulations... </seg>
<seg id="32"> What is important is that he knows now how to say "no" ... in a loud but civilized voice, and in a way that expresses his weariness of the arrogance of Westerners against the Arabs who need them, seek refuge in them, and line up in order to obtain visas to enter and work there... </seg>
<seg id="33"> The Western arrogance which had gone on for too long, continued and recently overflowed to violate that which is sacred ... the sacred which in all cultures is considered an important red line and entitles everyone to protest its violation in a belittling and mocking manner... </seg>
<seg id="34"> When I say this I know that all the boycotting, mine and yours, will not hurt or lessen the value of Danish butter or its worldwide reputation ... or its stupid cows. ... But we will do it for ourselves ... so that we don't lose the one and only simple "No" that we now have, and which is filling our mouths... </seg>
<seg id="35"> Let us say that we exist and live on this planet with all our problems and crises ... that we are able to coexist, that we deserve respect ... that we have the right to express ourselves, to reject ... and if need be, even hate... </seg>
<seg id="36"> In order to avoid creating discord and pumping additional hatred into the sea of resentment engulfing this miserable planet..., I hope that Denmark would initiate a sincere apology to the Muslims and muffle the crisis... </seg>
<seg id="37"> It shouldn't expect that one apology would clear the united Islamic heart on the spot ... because the shock was overwhelming, and erasing it will not be easy... </seg>
<seg id="38"> Because if that apology doesn't happen, we will keep singing this tune for the rest of our lives... nursing the pain of hatred.... We will teach our children, and our children will teach their children that Denmark and Satan are brothers and require the same treatment... </seg>
<seg id="39"> If that apology doesn't happen, resentment will continue to rage ... maybe Denmark will be stunned by what initially provoked the  emotions of Muslims.... Maybe it will find a good application of the heartless terrorist model, wearing the turban (equipped with a bomb) on its land among its beautiful citadels and dull cows... </seg>
<seg id="40"> Maybe Denmark will lose all its beauty and innocence (because of its insolence)... </seg>
<seg id="41"> Maybe this time, its cows chattered much more stupidly than necessary... </seg>
<seg id="42"> Maybe it doesn't take more than a few days for us to witness something we never hoped would happen in Denmark... </seg>
<seg id="43"> Maybe everything will happen (here or there)... </seg>
<seg id="44"> Oh how much I hate "maybe" in these contexts! God protect us from the evil of the word "maybe"...!!! </seg>

</hl>

<seg id="5"> Negative and Positive Self Programming </seg>
<seg id="6"> Most people are programmed at a young age to behave, talk or believe in a certain negative way, and it grows with them until they become prisoners of what is called "negative programming" which limits their access to many things in life. </seg>
<seg id="7"> We find that a large number of them say, "I have a weak personality," "I can't quit smoking," "I am weak in spelling," "I..." </seg>
<seg id="8"> We find that they acquire this negativity from either family or school or friends, or all of them. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But can this negativity be transformed into positive programming? The answer is a definite yes. But why do we need to do that? </seg>
<seg id="10"> In order to be happy, successful and lead a good life, we need to positively program ourselves. We especially as Muslims have a mission and a goal that we have to accomplish in order to worship God Almighty and serve as His vicegerents on earth. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Before we begin transforming the negative programming, we have to agree on the following: </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is important that you yourself make the decision that you want to change. Your decision will serve as your guide leading you to change from negativity to positive programming. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Repeating words and behaviors that you will identify and make them part of your life. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now the first step to positive programming is: </seg>
<seg id="15"> Speaking to yourself </seg>
<seg id="16"> Have you ever watched someone talking loudly to himself while walking, moving his arms, mumbling, and maybe even cursing? Excuse me, but we don't want to act like him. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Or have you ever had a heated argument with someone, and once he left you replayed the argument in your mind and you started thinking of the argument once again, changing words around and telling yourself,  "Why didn't I say this or that?" </seg>
<seg id="18"> Did it ever happen that while attending a lecture or listening to a speech you said to yourself, "I couldn't give a speech like that," or "how could I face all those people?" Or "It would be impossible for me to give a speech or give a lecture in front of people." </seg>
<seg id="19"> All of this inner conversation leads to negative human programming, which ultimately could lead to disastrous effects. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fortunately you, I, and anyone can deal with self talk, and we are able to transform any negative programming into a new one that empowers us. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A psychology engineering specialist says:  "We have the ability to change our past and our future at any moment through reprogramming our present." </seg>
<seg id="22"> Therefore as of this moment we have to watch and pay attention to these inner voices that speak to you. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was said: </seg>
<seg id="24"> Pay attention to your thoughts because they will become deeds. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Pay attention to your actions because they will become habits. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Pay attention to your habits because they will become your character. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Pay attention to your character because it will determine your future. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I would like to explain some scientific facts about the human mind. We will focus particularly on the subconscious. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The subconscious does not reason the same way the conscious mind does. It simply stores information and afterwards repeats it every time it is retrieved from storage. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If a message is programmed over a long period of time and constantly repeated, like for example, if every time you face a situation you say, "I am a shy person," "I am a shy person," "I am bad tempered," or "I can't play sports," "I can't quit smoking," and so on, these kinds of messages will be deeply embedded in the subconscious and can not be changed. But they can be replaced through healthy positive programming. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Another fact is that the subconscious mind has strange behavior which we must become aware of. For example, if I tell you: "Don't think of a black horse" can you actually do that and prevent your mind from thinking? Of course not. You probably already thought of a black horse. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Your mind canceled the word "no" and stored the rest of the sentence: "Think of a black horse." </seg>
<seg id="34"> So can we take advantage of such strange behavior of the mind? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Let us now present the essence of the matter by quoting what Dr. Ibrahim al-Fiqi wrote in his book "The Power of Self Control: Principles and a Practical Program for Positive Self Programming. " </seg>
<seg id="36"> He says: </seg>
<seg id="37"> The five rules for programming your subconscious mind are: </seg>
<seg id="38"> 1- Your message should be clear and specific. </seg>
<seg id="39"> 2- Your message should be positive. For example, "I am strong," "I am well." I can quit." </seg>
<seg id="40"> 3- Your message should address the present. For example, don't say, "I will be strong." Rather say, "I am strong." </seg>
<seg id="41"> 4- Your message must be accompanied by a strong awareness of its contents in order for the subconscious to accept it and program it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> 5- You should repeat the message several times to be completely programmed. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now here is a plan to follow for a positive conversation with yourself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Write down at least five negative internal messages that had an impact on you, such as the following: </seg>
<seg id="45"> I am a shy person, I can't quit smoking, I have a bad memory, I can't speak in front of an audience, I am bad tempered,  now, tear the paper that you wrote these negative messages on and throw it away. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Write down five positive messages that empower you and always start with "I." For example: </seg>
<seg id="47"> "I can quit smoking," "I like talking to people." " I have a good memory." </seg>
<seg id="48"> "I am a special person,"  "I am active and energetic." </seg>
<seg id="49"> Write down your positive message in a small notebook and always keep it with you. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Now take a deep breath and read the messages one after the other until you totally comprehend them. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Once again start with the first message. Take a deep breath and get rid of any tension in your body. Read the first message ten times with strong feeling. Close your eyes and imagine the new you. Open your eyes. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Starting today pay attention to what you say to yourself, what you say to others, and what others say to you. If you notice any negative message, cancel it by saying, "cancel" and replace it with another positive message. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Believe that you have the power, that you can be, that you have control, and that you can do whatever you want to do by simply defining precisely what you want and moving in that direction with all your strength. Jim Rohn, author of "Eternal Happiness," said, "Repetition is the mother of skills." </seg>
<seg id="54"> That is why you have to believe in what you say, and always repeat to yourself the positive messages. You are your own master and the captain of your ship. You control your life and you can transform your life into a positive experience of happiness, health, and success without limits. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Always remember: </seg>
<seg id="56"> Live each moment as though it were the last moment of your life. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Live by faith. Live by hope </seg>
<seg id="58"> Live by love. Live by struggle. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Value life. </seg>
<seg id="60"> (Quoted from " The Power of Self Control" by Dr. Ibrahim al-Fiqi.) </seg>
<seg id="61"> Finally, I pray for guidance, forgiveness, and mercy. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Amen. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Your brother in God. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Dandruff: Causes and Cure </seg>
<seg id="6"> I think it is a very widespread problem. Nearly everyone has suffered from it at one time or another in their life. </seg>
<seg id="7"> They used to believe that dandruff is caused by the rapid growth of the scalp cells, but this belief was proven wrong. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Recently they discovered that dandruff is caused by a kind of yeast known as Pityrosporum Ovale, </seg>
<seg id="9"> The problem begins when the blood circulation in the scalp weakens, </seg>
<seg id="10"> Stress </seg>
<seg id="11"> The use of hot water to wash hair, </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also the nature of oily hair plays an important role. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Sometimes dandruff doesn't constitute a significant problem. But when it falls on clothes, causes itching, or when it causes hair to smell bad the problem starts to appear. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Elegance and prestige evaporate. Dandruff then becomes an issue that needs an answer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The question is: how do we cure it? </seg>
<seg id="16"> There are general tips that we should consider: </seg>
<seg id="17"> 1. Not to use other people's tools for grooming hair. </seg>
<seg id="18"> 2. Make sure to keep our personal tools clean. In other words, wash the brush and comb at least once a week. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 3. Wash hair with certain kinds of treatment shampoos that are available in stores. </seg>
<seg id="20"> My advice is to use Nazirol shampoo. I am not trying to advertise the product or anything, but this shampoo contains Ketoconazole, which is an effective ingredient for getting rid of the yeasts that cause dandruff. </seg>
<seg id="21"> 4. After using the shampoo, rinse your hair with vinegar diluted with water while massaging the scalp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Meanwhile, there are some effective prescriptions: </seg>
<seg id="23"> *Wash your hair. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Rub your hair with apple vinegar </seg>
<seg id="25"> Leave it on for 15 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Rinse it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> *Wash your hair. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Mix half a cup of apple vinegar with half a cup of a lemon juice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Use the mixture to massage your scalp. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Leave the mixture on your hair for half an hour. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Rub your hair with olive oil. Leave it on for another 15 minutes and then shampoo your hair. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Repeat the process once a week until the dandruff disappears. You might only need to use it once. </seg>
<seg id="33"> *Olive oil, almond oil, and cactus oil help to restore balance to the scalp and provide nutrients. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Greetings and stay well. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Grief at the Red Sea </seg>
<seg id="6"> When my father saw the ferry capsizing and about to sink he put the life jacket on me. </seg>
<seg id="7"> After that I watched my father and then my mother drown. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I was left alone for 30 hours struggling against the waves. One of the survivors was helping me until the rescue team arrived and pulled me out of the water. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everything was lost. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For three difficult years I lived in Saudi Arabia, away from my homeland. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I came back with my life "savings" in order to get married and settle down. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But suddenly everything was lost .. everything. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was a fire in the lower decks of the ferry. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the crew prevented some of the passengers who saw the fire from wearing the life jackets, claiming that it would only cause unnecessary panic among the rest of the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This was the outcome, as you see. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ferry sank, and more than a thousand passengers drowned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> When we saw smoke coming out of the engine room on the lower deck, the ferry crew told us, "don't worry, we will put it out." </seg>
<seg id="18"> When things dramatically worsened, we could not find the life boats. Some of the ferry workers had taken them and left us on the ship to face death alone. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 30 hours I was in the water struggling against death. </seg>
<seg id="20"> 30 hours without food or water. </seg>
<seg id="21"> My skin was about to melt. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Is there no respect for us as human beings? </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the ferry passengers were Israelis, would they have been treated with this same neglect or this same lateness? </seg>
<seg id="24"> God blessed me with three children -- two girls and a boy. We all lived together in Saudi Arabia, </seg>
<seg id="25"> We decided to come back and settle in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I shipped my house furniture, my children's books and all of our belongings. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A little while after we took off at sea we became terrified when we saw the smoke coming out of the ferry. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Then it capsized and sank. </seg>
<seg id="29"> I saw my three children and my wife screaming and swallowing water. I was screaming trying to rescue them but fate was stronger. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I watched all of them drown. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Their books and some of their toys were floating on the surface. </seg>
<seg id="32"> God gives and God takes. </seg>
<seg id="33"> There is no power and no strength except in God. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When the fire grew we heard sounds of explosions coming from the ferry's kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We thought it was the gas tanks exploding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We yelled at the captain to go back to the port of Dubah which is closer than Safaga, but he refused. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We were terrified. The captain ordered us to knock on doors to get the passengers out of their cabins and gather them on the right side to balance the ferry, but within five minutes everybody drowned. </seg>
<seg id="38"> There was screaming and crying everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Men were appealing to God, "God save us! God have mercy on us!" </seg>
<seg id="40"> " </seg>
<seg id="41"> Others were reciting the Muslim creed. </seg>
<seg id="42"> ***** </seg>
<seg id="43"> God have mercy on the victims of the accident, and grant their families patience and consolation! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Because it is a sacred month, and because it is valued by God Almighty as a great month, the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) connected it to God Almighty, and said that it was the month of God. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is the month of Muharram. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Voluntary fasting during this month is one of the best ways to please God. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is better than any other voluntary fast through the whole year. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So make sure to fast as much as possible during this month. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Men's Chastity </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; Abu Suleiman </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Why does men's chastity have no value and get no respect? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Why has the chaste man, who controls his desires, become a topic of astonishment and suspicion? </seg>
<seg id="5"> Why is the man who doesn't practice illegal premarital sex, viewed by some as an idiot? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Why has the man who doesn't cheat on his wife become a coward, scared that his wife might find out, or find his manhood questioned? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Our society is highly concerned with women's virginity. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But why doesn't anyone address men's virginity? </seg>
<seg id="9"> In an era of openness and modernization, all means that facilitate committing what is forbidden are available. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Temptations surround us and are easily </seg>
<seg id="11"> obtained. There is nothing easier than the way of error which leads to depravity. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But we cannot use this as an excuse to commit sins, </seg>
<seg id="13"> If both men and women are affected by these temptations, then they are equal in accountability and punishment, </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to the divine rule in God's word: "Tell the believing men to lower their gaze, and guard their chastity. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Since the best, right way is to measure our behavior in accordance with the divine legislation and rule, we find that the revelation is absolutely clear in extending the concept to include men and women. </seg>
<seg id="16"> God says: "for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah's praise, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward." (The Confederates: 35) </seg>
<seg id="17"> So a man's chastity is no less important than a woman's, and it does not belittle his manhood. Therefore, just as chastity is expected from a woman, it is also expected from a man. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We have to extend the concept of virginity to include both men and women in order for the equation to be right. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But in our Eastern societies concepts are imbalanced. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Chastity is only required from a woman. It is her capital and the basis for her family's honor. </seg>
<seg id="21"> As for a man's chastity, feel free to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Nothing shames him, following the principle that any sin is permissible as long as it is discreet. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is an invitation to everyone to pursue chastity and abstain from committing what is forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Let us get rid of the common notion that a man's chastity is something he should be ashamed of, and he should avoid it in order not be labeled as an idiot uncultured, and inexperienced. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man's chastity represents his modesty. It is a virtue for the man who has it. It strengthens his faith, and helps him walk the straight and narrow and abstain from committing sins, avoid the wrath of God, and stay healthy and disease-free. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chastity begins in the heart, and extends to the whole body. For a man it is a clear indication of his strong character, his superiority, his ability to abstain from committing vice, his ability to control his desires, and his ability to control himself from being lured into temptations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A chaste person is an adult who has self control over all his desires and instincts, and who abides by God's rules in satisfying them. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He is a patient person who is eager to avoid committing sins and controls his desires. </seg>
<seg id="29"> His is a rare character achievable only by those who have strong faith. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The revelation includes all single men. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "Those who are not able to get married, let them abstain." </seg>
<seg id="32"> Tha'lab interpreted it as follows: </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let him have self control just like for fasting since it is honorable. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Chastity is expected from married and unmarried men alike. </seg>
<seg id="35"> How many men cheat on their wives and brag about their adventures to others so that they don't appear in front of others to have less status, or be less manly, and so they do not become the object of derision. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Dear brother, I ask you not to be weak. Maintain your purity and chastity. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Don't give in to temptations. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Try to strengthen your faith in God. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If you weaken remember that God is watching you and you will be questioned. We will all be questioned about our deeds. Your manhood will not intercede for you so that God can forgive you. The divine words are clear. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Chastity is not just a requirement for women. It is the duty of every person. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Don't make society a measure of your actions. </seg>
<seg id="42"> If you were not held accountable during your lifetime you won't escape punishment on Judgment Day. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Remember that death does not announce itself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> When it comes for you, it will not wait till you repent. </seg>
<seg id="45"> When their time come they can not delay it or advance it by an hour. </seg>
<seg id="46"> If you accept evil deeds, don't expect and don't request favorable reward. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Remember that reward is a measure of your deeds. </seg>
<seg id="48"> If you have been plagued with evil don't expect that God will grant you a good wife. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In the Sura "Light" God Almighty says "Impure women are for impure men, and impure men are for impure women; And women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity: these are not affected by what people say: for them there is forgiveness and an honorable provision." </seg>
<seg id="50"> " </seg>
<seg id="51"> God I ask you to grant me chastity and wealth. </seg>
<seg id="52"> " </seg>
<seg id="53"> We ask God to protect Muslim youth from all harm and evil. </seg>
<seg id="54"> God is the best protector and He is the most merciful. </seg>

<seg id="3"> They tied her up. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And took away her senses. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By the movement and elevation, she felt like she had been put on a howdah. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She heard the voice of her love among them. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Why isn't he reprimanding them? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Why isn't he stopping them from taking her? </seg>
<seg id="9"> The sound of rhythmic steps on rough dirt. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cold dawn breeze touch her white clothes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Although she is unable to see, she imagined a foggy atmosphere surrounding her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> She pictured the ground that she is in now as empty and desolate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> .. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Finally, all at once the steps stopped, and she felt like she had been placed on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Nearby she heard the sound of stones being picked up and laid down. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She was carried again. It was quiet all around. She felt the darkness eating away at her bones. </seg>
<seg id="17"> From above she could hear sobbing. It was her son. Yes, it was him. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Maybe he is coming to rescue her? </seg>
<seg id="19"> But what is this she's hearing? </seg>
<seg id="20"> He is calling her in a low voice: "Mother." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Through the tears her husband is talking to him, saying: "Pull yourself together." </seg>
<seg id="22"> Patience is at the first stroke of a calamity. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Pray for her, son. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Let's go.. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He felt a lump in his throat. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He took a final look at the shrouded body. He lost control and painfully said: "There is no deity except God." </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is no deity except God... </seg>
<seg id="28"> Surely we belong to Allah and to Him we return... </seg>
<seg id="29"> This was the last thing she heard him say... </seg>
<seg id="30"> Then there was the noise of a marble stone falling from above to cover the only opening that was the source of light, sound, and life. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The sound of steps leaving... </seg>
<seg id="32"> Where? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Where are you leaving me? </seg>
<seg id="34"> How could you abandon me alone in this darkness? </seg>
<seg id="35"> She looked around her and was able to see. </seg>
<seg id="36"> See? </seg>
<seg id="37"> What could she see in this black cellar? </seg>
<seg id="38"> The darkness is nothing like the darkness of the night she was used to which came with the moonlight, and the light of stars that reflected on things and people. Here, she could barely see her hands. In fact, she feels like her eyes are completely closed. </seg>
<seg id="39"> She remembered her loved ones. </seg>
<seg id="40"> She heard the steps grow distant and disappear. She trembled. </seg>
<seg id="41"> She got up wanting to follow them. </seg>
<seg id="42"> How could they leave her knowing that she was scared of the darkness and of being alone? </seg>
<seg id="43"> But a heavy hand violently sat her down. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Terrified, she looked behind her and she saw something she had never seen before. </seg>
<seg id="45"> She saw terror materialize as a creature. </seg>
<seg id="46"> But how could she see it in this intense darkness? </seg>
<seg id="47"> She asked in a trembling voice, "Who are you?" </seg>
<seg id="48"> She heard a voice ring out on her right: "We came to ask you." </seg>
<seg id="49"> She turned around.. </seg>
<seg id="50"> There was another creature like the first one.. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Helplessly she kept silent... </seg>
<seg id="52"> She wished the earth would swallow her so she wouldn't see these people. </seg>
<seg id="53"> But then she remembered that the earth had already swallowed her.. </seg>
<seg id="54"> She wanted to die to get away from this inescapable reality. </seg>
<seg id="55"> She was confused... Her wishes were invalid. She was already dead.. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Who is your God? </seg>
<seg id="57"> Hey. Who is your God? </seg>
<seg id="58"> My God? </seg>
<seg id="59"> All my life I worshipped only Allah. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What is your religion? </seg>
<seg id="61"> My religion is Islam. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Who is your prophet? </seg>
<seg id="63"> My prophet? </seg>
<seg id="64"> She pressed her memory. </seg>
<seg id="65"> How could she forget his name? </seg>
<seg id="66"> Wasn't she frequently saying it? </seg>
<seg id="67"> When she recited the Muslim profession of faith five times a day didn't she ask God to bless him? </seg>
<seg id="68"> The voice repeated angrily: "Who is your prophet?" </seg>
<seg id="69"> One moment, please... </seg>
<seg id="70"> I can't remember.. </seg>
<seg id="71"> The creature raised a thick stick and swiftly struck her on the head. </seg>
<seg id="72"> She screamed. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Her organs convulsed... </seg>
<seg id="74"> Suddenly his name lit up in her mind: </seg>
<seg id="75"> She screamed at the top of her lungs: "My Prophet is Muhammad." </seg>
<seg id="76"> Muhammad. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Then she forcefully closed her eyes but nothing happened.. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Deadly silence.. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Astonished, she opened her eyes. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The creature, whose name was Nakir, told her: You were saved by an invocation you frequently repeated: "Oh God, Changer of hearts, fasten my heart on Your religion." </seg>
<seg id="81"> She shivered.. </seg>
<seg id="82"> ... She wanted to smile happily but she couldn't... </seg>
<seg id="83"> This is not the time for smiling. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Dear God, when will these horrible moments be over? </seg>
<seg id="85"> After a while Munkar told her: You used to delay the dawn prayers. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Her eyes were wide open... </seg>
<seg id="87"> She knew that she had no way out this time... </seg>
<seg id="88"> Because he did not skirt the truth... </seg>
<seg id="89"> He pushed her in front of him... </seg>
<seg id="90"> She wanted to cry but she couldn't find the tears... </seg>
<seg id="91"> She walked in front of Munkar and Nakir through a long cellar until she arrived a place that looked like a prison. </seg>
<seg id="92"> ... </seg>
<seg id="93"> She felt nausea... </seg>
<seg id="94"> She wished she would pass out ... but it didn't happen... </seg>
<seg id="95"> She continued seeing the terrible place... </seg>
<seg id="96"> In every corner there was screaming and blood... </seg>
<seg id="97"> lamenting and wailing... </seg>
<seg id="98"> and bones were breaking... </seg>
<seg id="99"> and bodies were burning... </seg>
<seg id="100"> Stern merciless faces that would not respond to all these pleadings.. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The two angels pushed her from behind. She walked feeling her legs weakening... </seg>
<seg id="102"> She found herself getting closer to a man lying on his back.. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Right at the top of his head one of the stern, cold faces was standing... </seg>
<seg id="104"> Carrying a heavy boulder... </seg>
<seg id="105"> Right before her eyes the angel dropped the boulder on the man's head... It broke and rolled down away from his body... </seg>
<seg id="106"> She screamed. </seg>
<seg id="107"> .. She cried.. </seg>
<seg id="108"> She was completely shocked that she couldn't utter a word.. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Soon the head was back on the body.. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The angel dropped the boulder on it again... </seg>
<seg id="111"> Here .. she was told: c'mon .. Lie down beside this man. what? </seg>
<seg id="112"> C'mon .. </seg>
<seg id="113"> She was pushed violently .. </seg>
<seg id="114"> She began resisting.. </seg>
<seg id="115"> and resisting.. </seg>
<seg id="116"> and resisting.. </seg>
<seg id="117"> To no avail. </seg>
<seg id="118"> A dark fate lies ahead.. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Truly dark.. </seg>
<seg id="120"> She lay down terrified, sick to her stomach.. </seg>
<seg id="121"> She appealed to God. </seg>
<seg id="122"> She saw all the doors of invocation closed.. </seg>
<seg id="123"> The time to appeal had long gone. </seg>
<seg id="124"> ... She wished she had prayed to God during the good times.. </seg>
<seg id="125"> She wished she had prayed to God during her life.. </seg>
<seg id="126"> She wished she could go back and perform two sets of prayers. </seg>
<seg id="127"> .. Just two sets to put a good word for her.. </seg>
<seg id="128"> She looked upwards. An angel was standing above her. </seg>
<seg id="129"> .. Raising a huge boulder. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Telling her: This would be your torture until the day of resurrection because you used to sleep ignoring the mandatory prayers... </seg>
<seg id="131"> When she was overcome by despair she saw the most handsome young man walking towards her.. </seg>
<seg id="132"> She was gripped by feelings of hope... </seg>
<seg id="133"> His face was joyous and his smile lit up everything around him.. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The young man arrived and he spread his arms, blocking the angel... </seg>
<seg id="135"> He said to him: What brought you? </seg>
<seg id="136"> I was sent to protect her and to stop you. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Did God Almighty order this? </seg>
<seg id="138"> Yes .. </seg>
<seg id="139"> She couldn't believe her eyes... </seg>
<seg id="140"> The angel left, disappeared, and the handsome young man stayed.. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Is she dreaming? </seg>
<seg id="142"> The young man extended his hand to her. </seg>
<seg id="143"> She got up.. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Gratefully she asked him: Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="145"> I am your good son's prayers for you and his charity on your behalf.. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Ever since you died, he has been constantly praying for you until God materialized his prayers in the most beautiful image and gave it permission to respond and come here. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Once again, she felt the presence of Munkar and Nakir. </seg>
<seg id="148"> She turned to them. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Explanation of How to Transfer a Cassette Tape to a CD </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt;  Mr. AbuEin </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> During the cassette tape era, it was almost impossible to find a home that did not have one. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Because the cassette tapes were easy to use and inexpensive, they showed up at home, in the car, at the office, and everywhere else. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Some of these cassettes were original, professionally recorded and more expensive. Others were recorded at home and may have sentimental value representing a memorable event, or they might be a copy of a song or something else. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Now we have entered the digital era. But that does not mean that we cancel our memories. </seg>
<seg id="7"> We can transfer these audio recordings -- whether they are on cassette tape, quarter inch tape, or LPs -- to a digital MP3 device on digital CDs. This would enable you to listen to them on the computer and digital CD players and send them anywhere by electronic mail. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Preparing the devices and equipment </seg>
<seg id="9"> In order for you to be able to convert recordings on tapes to a digital form on the CD, you must first install the necessary equipment and programs on the computer so it will be able to perform this job. You must also have a computer that is relatively new, and that has a sound card. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In order to begin, you have to connect your cassette player to the computer. That is usually done by using the common connector as shown in the picture here. This connector is available in any store that sells electrical accessories, and usually it's inexpensive. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Connect one end of the connector to the line-out port, and connect the other end to the line-in port of the computer's sound card. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The other thing is that you need a program able to record the sound that is coming through the line-in port of the sound card. </seg>
<seg id="13"> MusicMatch Jukebox is one of the best and easiest to use programs. This program has many useful features. Most important is that you can get it for free on the internet. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Download and install this program on your computer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You can visit the website for this program to download it to your system. The website address is http://www.musicmatch.com/ </seg>
<seg id="16"> or through this link. It is approximately nine megabytes. Click here to download the program. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In order to be able to use the recording anywhere, and also to free the large amount of space used by the audio recordings on your hard drive, you should have CD recording equipment. </seg>
<seg id="18"> CD burners are also able to read CDs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This equipment uses two kinds of CDs which are able to record audio and  computer program data. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first are CDs that can record once only, while the others can record several times. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The second are better, but they are several times more expensive than the first type. </seg>
<seg id="22"> To begin: </seg>
<seg id="23"> Step one: </seg>
<seg id="24"> After you have installed the MusicMatch software, and you have connected the stereo to the sound card by using the connectors mentioned above, you can now start recording by taking the following steps: </seg>
<seg id="25"> Start the MusicMatch program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> From the upper menu choose in succession: "Options," then "Recorder," then "Source," and then "Line-in," as shown in the following picture: </seg>
<seg id="27"> Now a new window will appear under the program's first window. If it does not appear click on the REC button. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In this window you will see the two words "Artist" and "Album." Click on them, then change the name to the name of the new recording that you are about to make. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Now press the record button "REC" in this window, and then start playing the cassette tape in the stereo. </seg>
<seg id="30"> When the recording is completed press the stop button, "Stop." </seg>
<seg id="31"> The recording must be completed and placed in the music library of the program. </seg>
<seg id="32"> You can repeat these steps for another recording. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Recordings are automatically stored at a speed of 128 kbps which is more than enough for most high quality cassette recordings. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When the first recording is completed you must listen to it, to check the sound quality. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the recording is muddled or too soft, you can reset the volume level from the stereo to the computer or by using the Windows program itself. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the bottom of the screen on the task bar you will find a volume icon that looks like a horn. Double click on it, and then adjust the volume by using "Play control" or "Volume control." </seg>
<seg id="37"> Select "Options," then "Properties," then "Recording," and finally "OK." A record control window will appear. Select the desired volume. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Of course you must make sure not to hit the "Mute" button, otherwise you will get nothing. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You can use the special recording features in this program to adjust the various elements to enhance the sound. To do this, choose "Options," then "Settings," then "Recorder," then "Advanced." </seg>
<seg id="40"> From this box choose the sound effect you want, such as fades and other effects, in order to produce MP3 recordings similar to professional recordings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> With more expertise in this program and continued recording you will become more knowledgeable. Converting your old recordings from analog to digital will become easier and faster. </seg>
<seg id="42"> After you have prepared 74 minutes at most of MP3 recordings, you can begin to make a digital audio compact disk. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Step two: </seg>
<seg id="44"> After you pick and collect enough MP3 recordings you can make your own play list for recording on a CD arranged as you like. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You will find the play list on the right hand side of the MusicMatch Jukebox program window. </seg>
<seg id="46"> In order to copy a song or a musical piece to this list, you can use the mouse to drag any file from the music library to this window. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Generally the recording CD can record 74 minutes of music. Currently MusicMatch does not work with the new 80 minute CDs. </seg>
<seg id="48"> As soon as you finish preparing the musical pieces that you wish to record on the CD click on the "CD" button. A window or a new dialogue box will appear with a number of options for recording a CD. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Make sure you select "Audio" (default) as the type of disk that you want to create. If you select the other choice you can store more than 600 megabytes on the empty disk. But this type does not work with ordinary music CD players. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The status bar at the bottom of the window informs us how much empty space is still available on the CD. </seg>
<seg id="51"> You can add or delete from the play list that you intend to put on the CD, in order to produce a more accurate CD, by using "Test then write CD." </seg>
<seg id="52"> You may also want to leave one second or more of silence between two pieces of music. </seg>
<seg id="53"> When you are ready to copy, put the empty CD in the CD recorder and then click the "Create CD" button. </seg>

<seg id="3"> 1000 new members daily </seg>
<seg id="4"> The new website Myspace steals the spotlight from Google </seg>
<seg id="5"> www.myspace.com </seg>
<seg id="6"> A promising new star has recently begun to shine in the world of the internet, especially after it succeeded in creating a name that has become widely known in technical circles. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In just two years this newcomer has attracted a large number of visitors and users, exceeding all expectations. The number of users and visitors is two and half times greater than that of the internet giant Google. </seg>
<seg id="8"> MySpace has proved itself as one of the most important communities on the internet. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The secret behind the success of this site lies in its learning from the mistakes of its predecessors, transforming them into strong points, which has made it very appealing to young people, particularly among students and musicians, after it allowed them to interact with their friends and provided them with most of the services offered by other websites, in one place. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some may wonder about the secret behind the success of the site despite the fact that it is not the only website of its kind. But quite simply, why would its users need to go to another website when all their friends are on MySpace, especially when users are encouraging and urging their friends to join the site? </seg>
<seg id="11"> It also surpassed its competitors in being more capable of personalization, allowing the user the opportunity to add a personal touch to his page by means of background colors, layout, images, video clips, and various other features. This distinction allowed it to beat its stubborn competitor Friendster when the total number of registered users exceeded 54 million (with an average of 180,000 new members each day) compared with more than 24 million users on Friendster. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new site introduces a new way to converse with your acquaintances and friends. The main page eliminates the need to download email or an instant messaging program. This is the page through which a user can hold discussions and exchange private messages. It also enables them to monitor their professors and their lectures. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the midst of all this success looms the danger of the internet for adolescents, casting its shadow over the website's success, particularly since the number of the site's members who are minors amounted to a quarter of its total users. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A large number of students from all over the United States have been arrested after they threatened their colleagues on the website. Furthermore, police in one state discovered illegal relationships between minors who met men on the website who claimed they were younger than they really were. This has forced parents and guardians to ban their children from using the website for fear of such dangers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But this has not prevented the owners of the website from going forward in developing it and providing it with international services to expand the spectrum of its users to include users from all over the world, standing by the slogan "We will do anything to keep our users." </seg>

<seg id="3"> This is Love </seg>
<seg id="4"> Ra'isiya: year: Wednesday, 9 Muharram 1427 A.H. - February 8, 2006. Islam's diary </seg>
<seg id="5"> In order for Moslems to know the position of their prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) and in order for Moslems to know how to show real love to this great prophet, there are the following attitudes: </seg>
<seg id="6"> Abu Bakr (may God be pleased with Him) </seg>
<seg id="7"> Here are the feelings which the heart of our master Abu Bakr formulates in words which are read. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Our master Abu Bakr says, "We were migrating and I was very thirsty. I brought some diluted yogurt and gave it to the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) and said to Him, 'Drink, Oh messenger of God.'" </seg>
<seg id="9"> Abu Bakr says, "The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) drank until my thirst was quenched." </seg>
<seg id="10"> Your eyes are not lying!! </seg>
<seg id="11"> The phrase is correct and was said on purpose. That is what Abu Bakr the righteous said.. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Have you tasted the beauty of this love? </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a special kind of love! </seg>
<seg id="14"> How do we measure in comparison to this love? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Consider this and do not be surprised. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is love, </seg>
<seg id="17"> love for the prophet more than love for self.. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The day Mecca was conquered, Abu Qahafa, the father of our master Abu Bakr, converted to Islam. He became a Moslem at a very old age and had become blind. Our master Abu Bakr took him to the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) to declare his conversion to Islam and to pledge allegiance to the prophet (God's bless Him and grant Him salvation). </seg>
<seg id="19"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said, "Oh Abu Bakr, why did you not leave the old man in his house? We could have gone to him." </seg>
<seg id="20"> Abu Bakr said, "You are more worthy for him to be brought to you, Oh messenger of God.".. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Abu Qahafa became a Moslem.. Our master Abu Bakr the righteous cried. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He was told, "This is a day of joy. Your father became a Moslem and was saved from Hell. So, what makes you cry?" </seg>
<seg id="23"> Can you imagine what Abu Bakr said? </seg>
<seg id="24"> He said, "Because I would have preferred to see Abu Talib pledging allegiance to the prophet, and not my father. This would have made the prophet happier, praise the Lord." He was happier when the prophet's happiness was greater than his father's. </seg>
<seg id="25"> How do we measure in comparison to this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Umar (may God be pleased with Him) says, "I was walking with the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) and some of his Companions. The prophet took my hand and walked. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Umar says, "I found myself saying, 'I really love you, Oh messenger of God.'" </seg>
<seg id="28"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said to him, "More than your son, Umar?" </seg>
<seg id="29"> I said, "Yes." </seg>
<seg id="30"> He said, "More than your household, Umar?" </seg>
<seg id="31"> I said, "Yes." </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said, "More than your property, Umar?" </seg>
<seg id="33"> I said, "Yes." </seg>
<seg id="34"> He said, "More than yourself, Umar?" </seg>
<seg id="35"> I said, "No." Look at how honest he is with himself and with the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation). </seg>
<seg id="36"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said, "No, Umar. Your faith will not be complete until you love me more than yourself." </seg>
<seg id="37"> Umar says, "I went out and thought. Then I returned shouting, 'Oh messenger of God, I really love you more than myself." </seg>
<seg id="38"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said, 'Now, Umar, now." </seg>
<seg id="39"> Abdallah the son of Umar said, "Father, what have you done to return with this idea?" </seg>
<seg id="40"> Umar said, "My son, I went out and asked myself who I will need more on the Day of Judgment: myself or the messenger of God?" </seg>
<seg id="41"> I found out that I need him more than I need myself. </seg>
<seg id="42"> I remembered how I went astray and how God saved me through him. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Abdallah the son of Umar said to him, "My father, if you forget everything about the messenger of God, what is the one thing you will never forget?" </seg>
<seg id="44"> Umar said, "If I forget everything, I will never forget the day I went to him and said, 'Oh messenger of God, allow me to go on the minor pilgrimage to Mecca." </seg>
<seg id="45"> He said to me, "Don't forget us in your righteous prayers, my brother." </seg>
<seg id="46"> He said something to me that made me happy and meant the world to me. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Anyone who only reads these words will not feel them. </seg>
<seg id="48"> They are really feelings which need a heart that loves the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) to receive them as they are: fresh and soft. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thawban (may God be pleased with Him) </seg>
<seg id="50"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) was away from our master Thawban, his servant the whole day. When he came back, Thawban said to him, "You made me miss you and feel lonely, Oh messenger of God," and he cried. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said, "Is this what makes you cry?" </seg>
<seg id="52"> Thawban said, "No, Oh messenger of God. But I remembered your place in paradise and my place and I remembered how lonely I would be." </seg>
<seg id="53"> The words of God Almighty were revealed: "Whoever obeys God, and the messenger -- they are with those whom God has blessed, prophets, just men, martyrs, the righteous; Good companions they are!" [69] (Sura "Women"). </seg>
<seg id="54"> Sawad )may God be pleased with Him( </seg>
<seg id="55"> Sawad ibn Azziya was standing in the midst of the army during the Uhud Raid. The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said to the army, "Straighten up. Stand upright." </seg>
<seg id="56"> The prophet looked and saw that Sawad did not do as he was told. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said, "Straighten up Sawad." </seg>
<seg id="58"> Sawad said, "Yes, messenger of God." He stood, but he did not do as he was told. </seg>
<seg id="59"> We heard the moaning of the tree trunk when the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) departed. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) came with his tooth cleaning stick and pricked Sawad in his abdomen. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Sawad said, "You hurt me, Oh messenger of God. God has sent you in truth, so lead me." </seg>
<seg id="62"> When they built the pulpit for Him, he left the tree trunk and went to the pulpit. </seg>
<seg id="63"> We saw the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) come down from the pulpit, go back to the tree trunk, and then wipe it. </seg>
<seg id="64"> He said, "Straighten up, Sawad." </seg>
<seg id="65"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) used to preach in his mosque before the pulpit was built next to the tree trunk so that the companions of the prophet would see him. The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) would stand and hold the tree trunk. </seg>
<seg id="66"> What do you think of such love? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Lastly, do not be less than the tree trunk. </seg>
<seg id="68"> He said, "Oh messenger of God, I think that today is a day of martyrdom. I wanted my last covenant with you to be touching my skin with your skin." </seg>
<seg id="69"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said to him, "Don't you want to be buried here and be with me in paradise?" </seg>
<seg id="70"> The tree trunk became quiet. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Sawad started to kiss the abdomen of the prophet. He said, "This is what I wanted." </seg>
<seg id="72"> The prophet uncovered his honorable abdomen and said, "Avenge yourself, Sawad." </seg>

<seg id="3"> http://www.islamtoday.net/questions/show_question_content.cfm?id=102303 </seg>
<seg id="4"> The title: Why is most of the Quran addressed to males? </seg>
<seg id="5"> The respondent: Dr. Muhammad Bin Hussein al-Jizani, a member of the faculty at the Islamic University in Medina. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The new classification; date: 12/01/1427 A.H. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The question: In the Quran we often see that God is addressing men. The same is also true in the Hadith. Why? </seg>
<seg id="8"> The answer: Praise be to God, and  blessings and peace be upon the messenger of God. Now to the subject: </seg>
<seg id="9"> This question was asked by the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salma (may God be pleased with her). She said, "I said to the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) why are we not mentioned in the Quran as men are mentioned?" </seg>
<seg id="10"> God's statement was revealed: "Male Moslems and female Moslems, male believers and female believers" (The Confederates: verse 35, Tradition of Ahmad 26575, Commentary of al-Tabari 22/10). </seg>
<seg id="11"> Because the Quran was revealed in the language of the Arabs and addressed them according to their own rules, women are included in the address to men because the Arabs give precedence to the grammatical masculine gender over the feminine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> A man may say, "Enter" or "go out," thereby addressing all those who are present, males and females. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is not correct in the language of the Arabs to say, "enter"[masculine plural form] and "enter" [feminine plural form], and "go out" [masculine plural form] and "go out" [feminine plural form]." </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is also known from the evidence of the Sharia and its intentions that the obligation to obey the rules of Sharia is directed to both men and women. All are obligated, addressed, accountable, rewarded, and punished. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is the regular principle and the general rule: men and women are included in all the rules on an equal basis. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, there are rules specifically for men, not for women, such as the prohibition of gold and silk, and the duty of observing Fridays and Jihad. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Likewise, there are rules specifically for women, not for men, such as the veil, child care, and other duties, as determined by the nature of both genders. God knows best. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Unsheathed Sword Against Those Who Insult the Prophet </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt;  Mohamed khawas &lt;mmakhawas@...&gt; </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> http://www.dorar.net/book_view.asp?book_id=7435. God's law regarding those on whom Moslems cannot take revenge when they insult the prophet or harm Him. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyya, said, "According to God's law, if believers cannot torture those who harm God and His messenger, then God Almighty will take revenge on him for His messenger and rescue His messenger from him." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The story about God destroying those scorners one by one is well-known and has been mentioned by biographers and commentators. They are, as was said, a group of the chiefs of Quraish, including: Al-Walid ibn al-Mughira, al-As ibn Wa'il, the two blacks Ibn Muttalib and Ibn Abd Yaghuth, and al-Harith ibn Qays. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) wrote to Khusrau and Caesar, neither of whom converted to Islam. But Caesar honored the letter of the messenger of God (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) and honored the prophet's messenger. His monarchy was established. It is said, "His kingship will continue in his offspring until today." </seg>
<seg id="7"> Khusrau tore the letter of the messenger of God (God bless him and grant him salvation) and scorned the messenger of God (God bless him and grant him salvation). God killed him a short time later and tore his kingdom into pieces. The dynasty of Khusrau had no kingdom. God knows best. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A common saying: "The flesh of scholars is poisoned meat." How much more is the flesh of the prophets (may God's peace be upon them). </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the "Al-Sahih" it is said about the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) that he said, "God Almighty says, 'Whoever is hostile to my companion has fought against me.'" How much more if someone is hostile to the prophets? </seg>
<seg id="10"> He who fights against God will be fought against. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If you study the stories of the prophets mentioned in the Quran, you will find that their nations were destroyed when they harmed the prophets and treated them with bad words or actions. Such was the case of the Israelites. They were forced into submissiveness and they faced God's anger. They did not have any supporter because they killed the prophets unjustly, in addition to being infidels, as God mentioned in His book. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Perhaps you will find that anyone who has harmed one of the prophets and has not repented will be stricken by a certain calamity from God. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We have mentioned what Moslems have tried in order to hasten revenge against infidels if they insult the messenger of God (God bless Him and grant Him salvation). We have heard about incidents like these in many events. This is a broad subject that cannot be covered. We did not mean to tackle it here. We only wanted to show the legal ruling. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Similar incidents have been reported by a number of honest Moslems,  Islamic legal scholars and people of experience, about how they tried many times to besiege fortresses and cities on the shores of Syria. When the Moslems besieged the tribe of Al-Asfar during our time, they said, "We used to besiege the fortress or city for one month or more, but the fortress was impossible for us, until we were almost in despair over it. But when its people insulted the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) and slandered his honor, we captured them quickly and easily; it barely took longer than one or two days or so. Then the place would be taken by force, and a massacre would take place." They said, "Even if we captured them quickly, when we heard them slandering Him, our hearts were filled with anger at them because of what they said about Him." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Likewise some of our reliable companions told me that Moslems in Morocco have the same situation with the Christians. It is in God's law that He tortures His enemies, sometimes by torturing them Himself and sometimes at the hands of His believers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> God Almighty used to protect him and keep him away from the harm and insults of people in every way, even in pronunciation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the "Sahihayn" it is told that Abu Huraira said, "The messenger of God (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) said, 'Can't you see how God removes from me the insults and curses of Quraish. They insult in their rebuke and they curse in their rebuke, and I am praised.'" God kept his name virtuous and described him with regard to the insult, and turned it against the slanderer himself even if he was the one who was doing harm, but his intention was the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What proves that insulting is a serious crime in addition to being infidel and an act of war - even if it implies that - is that the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) used to forgive hypocrites who harmed Him as mentioned above. He could have killed them as was mentioned in the Hadith by Abu Bakr and others. </seg>
<seg id="19"> If the vituperation was only apostasy, it was necessary to kill him, because the apostate must be killed. He knew that the rightness of the prophet (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) might be made to win in insulting, so he could forgive him. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This proves that insulting is a unique criminal offense. If a free non-Moslem living in a Moslem country insulted a Moslem or a covenanter and violated the covenant, then that man's insulting would be a serious crime for which he deserves a worse punishment than what he would deserve for merely violating the covenant. Therefore, insulting the messenger of God (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) is different from insulting an ordinary person. </seg>
<seg id="21"> He (may God have mercy on Him) said, "Cleansing the earth of any manifestation of insults to the messenger of God (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) is a duty as much as possible because it is part of the full manifestation of the religion of God and the exaltedness of God's word. Since the entire religion belongs to God, whenever it is insulted and there is no revenge against the person who did that, the religion would not be manifest and the word of God would not be exalted. The earth must also be cleansed of fornicators, thieves, and highwaymen as much as possible. This is different from cleansing it of infidels because this is not a duty. We can allow the people of the two books to practice their religion as protected non-Moslem subjects in Moslem countries who pay the poll tax because allowing them to be protected non-Moslem subjects who pay the poll tax obligates them to follow the rule of God and His messenger over them. This is not contrary to revealing the religion and exalting the word. Making a truce with the infidel and receiving his protection is allowed in times of weakness or for a desired interest. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The earth must be cleansed of every serious crime as much as possible. The punishment is imposed on the one who committed it according to the specific punishment specified in the Islamic religious law. If there is no particular person who has a claim for recompense, the perpetrator must be killed because this serious crime has no specific person with a claim to recompense, but it was against God, His messenger, and all the believers. In this way the difference between the one who insults and the infidel is revealed. It is permitted to allow the infidel who can be allowed to hide among his infidelity but is committed to the rule of God and His messenger. This is not true about the one who insults. </seg>
<seg id="23"> ----------------------- </seg>
<seg id="24"> (1) This was in his time (may God have mercy on Him). </seg>
<seg id="25"> If the descendants of Caesar mock the messenger of God (God bless Him and grant Him salvation) today, then this is good news that their rule and sovereignty will disappear with God's permission. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Mentioning God in the Bathroom </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt;  KG &lt;ghazyk@...&gt; </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Is it permissible for a Moslem to read the Quran or to think about God without saying it out loud, while he is in the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="4"> The answer: </seg>
<seg id="5"> Praise be to God </seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. There are two kinds of mention of the Lord's name: mention with the tongue, such as reading the Quran, reciting liturgical exercises, and reciting prayers which the Islamic law encourages, and mention the Lord's name in the heart, by thinking of God Almighty, His greatness, and His power, as well as thinking of His creations (glory to Him) or reciting the Quran in one's mind. Doing that does not provide the reward for reading the Quran because the reward is linked to reading, which is only done out loud, and, for example, praying, which must be done out loud. It is not enough to pray inwardly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Scholars differentiated between the two kinds of mention of the Lord's name. They said, "It is offensive to mention God Almighty out loud in the bathroom because God is too exalted to be mentioned in this place." As for mentioning God inwardly, they said, "It is not offensive, and there is no objection to it." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The difference between the two kinds of mention of the Lord's name is shown by  the fact that scholars agreed that a person in a state of ritual impurity may recite the Quran in his mind, but it is forbidden for him to read it out loud and pronounce it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Al-Nawawi said, "They agreed that if a ritually impure person meditated on the Quran inwardly without moving his tongue, he is not a reader committing the prohibited reading of the ritually impure." (Al-Nawawi's interpretation of Sahih Muslim). </seg>
<seg id="10"> Ibn al-Mundhir said in Al-Awsat, "Akrama said he does not mention God out loud while in the bathroom, but in his mind" (Al-Awsat). </seg>
<seg id="11"> The permanent committee said, "One of the rules of conduct of Islam is for a person to mention his Lord whenever he wants to enter the bathroom or the bath by saying before he enters, 'Oh God, I take refuge in you against malice and malicious acts.' He should not mention God after he enters, and he should refrain from mentioning Him the moment he enters." (Fatwas of the permanent committee, 5/93). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Sheikh Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz said, "Mentioning God in the mind is legitimate any time and any place, in the bathroom or anywhere else. But what is offensive in the bathroom and similar places is mentioning God out loud exalting Him, except for mentioning His name during ablution. This is done if it is not possible to perform the ablution outside the bathroom, because it is a duty according to some scholars and a confirmed custom among the public." (Fatwas of Sheikh Ibn Baz, 5/408). God knows best. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rod Larsen: The Middle East is "a barrel of gunpowder with a flaming wick." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Oslo 6-2 (FB) - Terry Rod Larsen, former United Nations envoy to the Middle East considers that the situation in the region has never before reached the perilous state it is currently at, likening the region to "a barrel of gunpowder with a flaming wick." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rod Larsen stated, while addressing the public Norwegian radio broadcast, NRK, that it is currently possible, in several ways, to liken the region to "a barrel of gunpowder with a flaming wick." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added: "I believe the situation is more difficult, complex and dangerous than it was several decades ago." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Among the current or underlying crises in the Middle East, Rod Larsen mentioned the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Iranian nuclear portfolio, as well as the crisis between Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He stated: "All this leads us back to crucial values and opinions, which render the situation prone at any moment to getting out of control, more so than it was in past days." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Rod Larsen omitted frank mention of the acts of violence interspersed with demonstrations in the Islamic world, in objection to the publication of caricatures of the prophet Mohammed in European newspapers, finding it sufficient to stress the necessity of "dialogue" instead of "casting stones and flaming fire." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Demonstrators burned the buildings of the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Damascus on Saturday, while a building housing the Danish embassy in Beirut was also set ablaze, in response to the publication of the drawings in September in the Jyllands Posten Danish newspaper, and their re-publication later in several modes of the European media, at the forefront of which was the Norwegian Magazinet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Rod Larsen is currently commissioned to oversee the implementation of International Security Council Resolution 1559, which dictates confiscating the weapons of militias and armed groups in Lebanon including, in the view of the Council, the Lebanese Shiite Hizballah and Palestinian groups. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Brussels 7-2 (FB) - Mayor of the west Belgian town of Middlekerke, Michel Landuyt, announced to France Press that he has decided to ban a controversial work of art depicting ousted president Saddam Hussein in cuffs, which bore the signature of visual Czech artist David Cerny, considering it emotionally shocking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Landuyt, mayor of the Belgian coastal resort, justified his decision on Monday by saying: "This work of art could upset people emotionally, not merely the locals, but also tourists and perhaps those of other faiths, particularly Muslims." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, he clarified that the work of art was completed a year ago and had no link to the caricatures of prophet Muhammed published in Europe, which during the past few days caused a wave of condemnation and violence in the Islamic world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The work of art bearing the title "The Shark" depicts Saddam Hussein in cuffs swimming in a bowl filled with liquid. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Michel Landuyt said: "I took into account that (the work) would be emotionally shocking", emphasizing that Saddam Hussein is currently on trial, the hearings being aired on television. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas Refuses what Members of Fatah Consider Endangering Palestinian National Plan </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By: Taher Al-Majthoub </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (Repetition with clarification in the fourth paragraph) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ramallah (West Bank) February 8 (AFP). Certain circles in the Fatah Movement have expressed their concern about the Palestinian National Plan being in danger, with the advent of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement into Palestinian government, yet the Islamic Movement strongly rejects this suggestion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Adnan Al-Damiri, one of Fatah's leaders in the West Bank, stressed to Agence France Press that "Hamas, as part of the Muslim Brotherhood all over the world, is not concerned with the regional issue of the Palestinian government as much as the national issue of Islam". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He also said "The other aspect is that Hamas is a resistance movement which can be compared with the Taliban and Chechnya movements and this is a quality distinguishing it from other Islamic Movements in the Arab and Muslim world, but Hamas has not performed operations outside the borders of Palestine." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Al-Damiri, who nominated himself on behalf of the Fatah Movement in the last elections but wasn't successful, considered that the difference between Hamas and Fatah is that "Fatah has a program for striving to negotiate for the establishment of the Palestinian government in the West Bank and Gaza strip with East Jerusalem as its capital in line with the borders of 1967. Fatah considers this a strategic solution while Hamas sees it as temporary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Similarly, a Palestinian official who refused to reveal his identity emphasized that Hamas "is a part of the Islamic Expansionism which doesn't care about establishing a regional government as much as it cares about establishing the Islamic Caliphate. Hence, its interests might interfere with those of Tehran and Damascus and it is nominated to ally with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood in any of the world's countries". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He added "Syria might also make use of it in the framework of continuing its policies which aspire to make use of the Palestinian and Lebanese issues as a means of pressuring Israel, especially since the Baath party considers the regional issue as dualism with respect to Arab Nationalism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Hence, if Hamas agrees to make peace with Israel for 10 or 15 years, it might go back on the idea of liberation and concentrate on imposing the Islamic Plan on society as he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> More than one official in Hamas has affirmed that the Islamic Movement, which is getting ready to establish the new Palestinian government, is willing to enter a long truce with Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In a talk with France Press, Hamas' deputy Mahmoud Al-Rumhi strongly denied that Hamas might be exposing the National Palestinian Plan to danger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He also said "These allegations have no basis in truth and the one-sided policy of Israel started before Hamas' success. That was when the Fatah Movement was in power because the Oslo Agreements (1994) did not determine when settlement ends nor did it specify the limits of the Palestinian government" and thus the Movement doesn't hold any responsibility in exposing the Palestinian Plan to danger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He also added that Israel, in its same-one sided policy, decided to "retreat from the Gaza strip and build the separating wall before the victory of Hamas, before the date of the elections was decided and before the decision of Hamas to participate in them" affirming that Israel does not respect any of the signed treaties and negotiating won't stop that, and the only solution is to continue to resist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Director of the Hamas Movement's Politburo announced on Wednesday that the Movement might adhere to a long truce with Israel if they retreat to the borders of 1967 and acknowledge Palestinian rights. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Al-Rumhi said "The truce with its conditions, which are establishment of a Palestinian government within the borders of 1967 along with East Jerusalem and setting prisoners free", emphasizing that "if we are unable to have these conditions met, Israel doesn't let out any prisoner and it doesn't retreat from the West Bank, then Hamas is going to back out of the settlement which it agreed upon in the Cairo Agreement". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> As for Ahmad Saadat, Secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, spoke to France Press from his prison in Ariha: "We do not fear any Palestinian party letting go of the Palestinian Plan because the battle, from the start, is with the occupying Israelis and we did not hear the Hamas Movement abandoning the Palestinian issue's invariables under any banner or program". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He emphasized that "Clinging onto these invariables and fighting occupation are common denominators" and "resistance is linked to the presence of occupation". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saadat added "We await that which Hamas is going to put forward, and what is required of all powers of the Palestinian society is a democratic view and internal agreement as the first part of electing the members of parliament and the second part must consist of the direct participation of our citizens abroad in the elections". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It indicates that both the Popular Front and Hamas reject the Oslo Agreements and the road map plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Bassam Al-Salihi, the member of parliament for the Alternative Parliamentary Cluster (The People's Party-leftist) also considered that "it is too early to come up with general or hasty conclusions for many reasons, one of them being that the victory of Hamas doesn't necessarily mean the loss of political balance in a definite way". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Yet he requested a "careful look at the results of the elections because the support of Hamas amongst the Palestinian public doesn't exceed half the voters, 40%", adding, "I believe The Liberation &amp; Independence Organization, International Rights and The Arab Peace Initiative make up the majority amongst the Palestinian public". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Al-Salihi said "It is very hard for any political party to reach any agreement short of this program". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Al-Salihi indicated that his front "is thinking of presenting a plan in parliament or the central council of the Liberation Organization to announce the 1967 border as those of the Palestinian government with Jerusalem as its capital and asking the world to accept this... (because the issue of the border isn't an issue of negotiation, but an issue of battle)". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Al-Salihi affirmed that "We now believe that the first mission is reconstructing the Palestinian Democratic Movement on a clearer basis in both its political and social aspects. The basis is the independence document because it outlines a social view for the political government built on a secular system". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tokyo, February 8 (AFP). The Japanese Company, Suzuki, assured that it will soon announce its plans in terms of whether it will participate in the World Rally Championship or not, without revealing any related details about this issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> David Farkohar, media and public relations department director in the Japanese company, revealed that the announcement will be made towards the end of the Geneva Car Exhibition at the end of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many in World Rally Championship circles are discussing that Suzuki might join the official manufacturing family starting from next year, keeping in mind that it currently participates in the Junior WRC, driving the Swift S1600 and earned the Swedish Rally Title, the first stage of this championship and the second stage from the WRC Championship with its Swedish driver Pierre Gonar Anderson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Suzuki participated in many Rallies, outside these two divisions, which constitutes its preparation for possible entry to the higher division in the championship. Its advertisement today about making the decision in regard to this matter on the 28th of this month (at 2 o'clock Geneva time) is what backs up these predictions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In case it does decide to participate, that will be a great promotion for the championship, especially after the withdrawal of the two French companies Citroen, the world champion for the past 3 years and Peugeot, as well as Japanese Mitsubishi, Czech Skoda and Korean Hyundai from official racing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Citroen will return to the championship next year with a new car "C4" instead of Casara, keeping in mind that it will be semi-officially promoting the Belgian Company Cronos Rising (Citroen Casara) and its drivers the French Sebastian Lob, world champion for the last two years, and his Spanish fellow Cazavieh Bonz as well as promoting its citizen Daniel Sordo, Junior WRC Champion last year who is following in the footsteps of Lob himself who was crowned with the championship for this division before moving to the higher division. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The number of official manufacturers in the championship will increase to 4, if Suzuki participates and Citroen returns next year, as well as Subaru and Ford who won first and second place in this year's championship with its new Finnish driver Marcos Grownholme. While other participations in the "Special Division" are limited, as is the case with the Finnish Tony Gardmyster (Astra Racing - Peugeot 307) who was absent from the Swedish Rally after reaching third place in Monaco, French Jill Banitzi (Red Bull - Skoda) and Italian Gigi Ghaly who participates at his own expense (Mitsubishi Lancer W the 2005 model). </seg>

<seg id="2"> Jerusalem February 10 (AFP). Today, Friday, Israeli Education Secretary Meir Sheetrit considered the invitation of the Russian President Vladimir Putin for Hamas to visit Moscow as an "actual stab in the back" of Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Secretary, in a statement to the public Israeli radio station, said that "this initiative is certainly a stab in the back (...) because the purpose behind it is granting international legitimacy to a terrorist group and we must oppose it with every means". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By: Nasib Azar </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Damascus, February 11 (AFP). Today, Saturday, Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad issued 3 decrees for a cabinet reshuffle, bringing in 14 new secretaries to government. Changes were also introduced specifically to the positions related to Foreign Affairs, coinciding with the external pressure campaign of which Syria has been suffering for more than a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the first decree, Foreign Secretary, Farouq Al-Shara, was appointed "vice president, overseeing the implementation of media and foreign policies". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second decree introduced changes in Mohammed Naji Al-Atri's cabinet and accordingly brought in 14 new secretaries to the government in sensitive positions like Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs and Media. In accordance with this, Walid Al-Muallim was appointed as Foreign secretary after being Deputy to Foreign Secretary Farouq Al-Shara. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As for the third decree, it dictated the appointment of Syria's representative at the United Nations, Faisal Al-Miqdad, as deputy Foreign Secretary replacing Al-Muallim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The cabinet reshuffle did not include the prime ministership which remained under the leadership of Secretary Mohammad Naji Al-Atri, while General Bassam Abdul Majid was appointed as Secretary of the Interior instead of Ghazi Canaan who committed suicide on the 12th of last October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> General Abdul Hamid was chief of military police in Syria since 2002, and before that an intelligence official for the southern Syrian region, and born in Al-Qunaitra in 1950. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the Media Department, Mahdi Dakhl Allah was dropped and replaced with Mohsen Belal who was the Syrian Ambassador in Spain for many years and a professor at Damascus University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Sufyan Alaw was appointed as the Oil &amp; Mineral Resources Secretary replacing Ibrahim Haddad, and Ghiyath Barakat as the Higher Education Secretary replacing Hani Murtada. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Defense Secretary Hassan Turkmani remained in his position, also Buthaina Shaaban remained as Immigration Secretary, Mohammed Al-Hussein as Treasury Secretary and Amir Husni Lutfi as Economy and Trade Secretary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Joseph Swede was appointed Secretary of State, and he is the first member of the National Social Syrian Party to be appointed as a secretary ever since the party joined the National Front in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Baath party obtained Al-Asad's share in the government, so they took over 19 departments including the Prime Ministership, while 7 secretaries were appointed from 7 different parties represented in the National Progressive Front, in addition to 7 retired secretaries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The National Progressive Front encompasses an assembly of 10 parties, on top of them is the Baath party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> All 9 parties are usually represented in the National Front except the Baath party, which is represented in the government, but the current cabinet reshuffle left two parties without representation and they are the Arab Socialist Union Party led by Safwan Qudsi and the Federal Socialist Movement led by Ghassan Abdul Aziz Othman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The parties of the other front were represented by 6 secretaries of state, while the Communist Party obtained the Irrigation Secretariat represented by Yousef Al-Faisal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This cabinet reshuffle wasn't surprising since it had been spoken of ever since the suicide of Ghazi Canaan, who freed the position with his death on the 12th of last October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> These cabinet reshuffles coincide with the International Pressure Campaign which Syria is experiencing on backdrop of the investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri when two reports from the International Investigation Panel indicated the involvement of Lebanese &amp; Syrian intelligence agents in the assassination. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Yemeni President Cabinet Reshuffle Following Escape of 23 Al-Qaeda Militants </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By: Hamoud Monser </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Sana, February 11 (AFP) - Yemen News Agency (Saba') has reported that Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh announced a cabinet reshuffle today, Saturday, following the escape of 23 supposed Al-Qaeda members from a Yemeni prison last week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Yemeni President decided to keep Prime Minister Abdel Qader as head of government and sack Defense Minister Abdullah Ali Eleiwa and 15 other ministers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Yemeni President also sacked the two deputy prime ministers Eleiwi Al-Salami and Ahmed Soufa who held the finance and planning portfolios respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Interior Minister Rashad Al-Aleemi has kept his portfolio and become the only deputy prime minister. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Brigadier general Mohammed Nasser Ahmed Ali has also been appointed as Defense Secretary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The outgoing government was formed in May 2003 following the victory of the General People's Congress ruling party in parliamentary elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The cabinet reshuffle follows criticism leveled at the Yemeni government, especially by the US, following the escape of 23 so-called Al-Qaeda militants from a prison run by Yemeni intelligence in Sana last Saturday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Among the militants that broke out of a jail in Sana, were 13 Al-Qaeda members, two of which were convicted for the bombings of the USS Cole and the French supertanker Limburg, including Jamal Al-Badawi, who was serving a 10 year sentence for the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American soldiers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Yemeni authorities carried out a campaign to hunt down the fugitives and arrested about 95 of their relatives in an attempt to force them to surrender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The prisoners managed to flee the prison by digging a 44-meter long tunnel connecting their cell with a nearby mosque. The diameter of the tunnel was no bigger than 70 centimeters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Marine ships of the coalition, led by the US, which roam the regional waters of Yemen, took part in the hunt for the 23 fugitives. At the same time the Interpol (International Police) released an international alert about their escape. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Yemen is the ancestral homeland of the family of Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda, which claimed responsibility for the attack. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the US, Yemen has worked closely with Washington to uproot those suspected of supporting Al-Qaeda in Yemen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> On the other hand, a Yemeni court rejected today, Saturday, the appeal filed by three jailed Al-Qaeda members, amongst them one of the prison-breakers who was convicted of carrying out attacks against Western targets in the Gulf states. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Baghdad, February 13 (AFP). Former Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, and his 7 assistants caused a state of disorder on Monday during their 11th trial hearing by swearing at and interrupting the judge whom they accused of bringing them by force to court while their defense team was absent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Saddam Hussein entered the courtroom wearing a blue gown and a black jacket. As he entered he was saying "Down with the traitors, down with the traitors, down with Bush, long live the nation, long live the nation, long live the nation". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The former president told the judge that he was forced to enter the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Then ensued a state of disorder when the accused objected about being brought to the courtroom by force. Birzan Ibrahim Al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's step-brother, yelled at the judge, Raouf Rashid Abdul Rahman, saying "You have nothing to do with Mercy and such names. You are not praised or compassionate, you are a military commander, not a judge, we don't want to sit here in this place". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He added "I can't continue this trial hearing while my personal lawyer is absent". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He continued to say that he is plagued with "a disease that has no cure. Medical examinations were carried out on me by the Americans in the American Camp, for that reason you must set me free so I can seek medication. The law dictates the importance of setting free any accused person who suffers from an incurable disease. I am dying slowly, you are killing me". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> When the judge informed him that the court has agreed to present him to a medical team, he said "If you fear Allah, set me free so I may seek medication amongst my family and I will sign any pledge to attend the trials. I have a matter of honor and I want to go and defend my honor". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> He continued "If you imagine that the Baath party needs me, then know that the Baath party is operating very well and doesn't need me or others. Here is its secretary-general (he pointed at Saddam Hussein), he's been in prison for two years, so set me free so I can seek medication". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The judge replied "You have spoken a lot and wasted much of the court's time", Barzan interrupted him saying "I have the right to speak from now till tomorrow". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> After that, Barzan Al-Tikriti noticed that the judge ignored his demands to be set free, so he left his seat, sat on the floor and turned his back at the judge ignoring the court hearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Saddam, who looked angry, swore at the judge, while holding the Qur'an in his hand, because of being compelled to attend the hearing. He said "This is the practice of traitors, Allah is great and may the lowlifes be driven away. Damn your whiskers!" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> He added "This is not a court hearing, this is a game" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Saddam told the judge "It is not your right to appoint lawyers for us instead of our lawyers with all due respect to them, because they agreed to defend us; my respect to every Iraqi". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The judge explained that "The court appointed alternative lawyers from the defense team according to Iraqi law after the defense lawyers boycotted the hearings". Saddam replied: "They didn't boycott the hearings, it was you who kicked them out and some of them were even being hit in front of you". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Judge Abdul Rahman replied "I do not permit you to speak of political matters". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saddam interrupted him "You are ignorant, what politics? You are working in a selective way against the law" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The legal proceedings then began with the reading of statements from a number of witnesses who mentioned what they experienced under the security system after being captured in 1982. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Saddam Hussein interfered, telling the court's president "when the witnesses speak of politics it is allowed, but when Saddam Hussein and his assistants speak about political matters it is not". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Saddam Hussein, his former assistants and defense team boycotted the tenth hearing which took place on February 8, when they left the hearing, which was preceded by an argument with the new judge who became the private court's president, Raouf Rashid Abdul Rahman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> On Sunday, the lawyer Khalil Al-Duleimi, director of Saddam Hussein's defense team, announced to Agence France Press in a telephone call "As director of the defense team, I can affirm that no one from the defense team or the accused will attend the court hearing today". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Jaafar Al-Mousawi, district attorney of the court, declared that "The court will convene a meeting before the court hearing to look into the possibility of bringing the accused by force or leaving them, if they insist on not attending". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> He found that "in case the court made a decision, it must be carried out regardless of its nature". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Saddam and his assistants have been on trial since last October in the matter of the killing of 148 villagers in the Shiite village of Al-Dejail, in retaliation for an attack targeting the former Iraqi president's escort during his visit to the village in 1982. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Mofaz told journalists, at the end of a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo, that "Hezbollah is using the Lebanese lands as terrorist activity bases against Israel". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added: "We know that Syria and Iran support Hezbollah and their goal is directing the attention of the international community away from Syria and towards the Lebanese Israeli borders". </seg>

<seg id="1"> Iran Confirms it Will Go Ahead with Uranium Enrichment (Conclusion) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Siafoush Ghazi: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tehran, February 14 (AFP) - Tehran has confirmed today, Tuesday, the resumption of uranium enrichment in the Natnaz facility, refusing to suspend "its research" in this area, while European countries have set the suspension of this activity as a condition to start negotiations with Tehran on its nuclear program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Jawad Waeedi, member of the Higher Council of National Security, who is in charge of the nuclear portfolio confirmed that "activities have started" in the Natnaz uranium enrichment facility (middle)." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Tehran announced on Monday the removal of seals and the surveillance cameras installed by the International Atomic Energy Agency at the Natnaz facility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Diplomatic sources at the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna announced that Iran resumed enrichment activities at that facility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But Waeedi refused to comment on the statements that Iranians have started the actual process of uranium enrichment by feeding uranium hexafluorure gas into centrifuges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He told journalists following an address to the students of a Tehran Islamic association "I can't provide you with answers for these technical issues." He also confirmed "It is not acceptable that we stop our research" stating that "uranium enrichment is the essence of the nuclear program." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The actual resumption of uranium enrichment resulted in a dead end in the dialogue with Europeans last August and later last January after it had been resumed last December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Those countries adopted a resolution on February 4th at the International Atomic Energy Agency demanding Iran to suspend all its sensitive activities and informed the UN Security Council of the Iranian portfolio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But instead of compliance, Iran responded by announcing the termination of the tight monitoring program implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency on its nuclear program and large-scale resumption of all activities that were put on hold, namely those relating to enrichment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Natnaz facility comprises two enrichment units; one of them is a project focusing on research and the other is an industrial plant under construction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As for this unit, Waeedi stated Iran "needs time to upgrade its industrial capabilities to 60 centrifuges to enrich uranium, but have started our activities." He added his country doesn't "find any need at present to suspend yet again" its activities in that facility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Waeedi justified the unilateral steps his country had taken on the basis that "after displaying good intentions for the last three years, Europeans have demanded the full abandonment of the nuclear fuel circle." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Europeans are particularly against the idea of Iran's enrichment on its soil because Iran has failed to prove that the nuclear program has purely civil aims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The enrichment process is necessary to get fuel for nuclear stations but can also be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It is expected the International Atomic Energy Agency will convene again on the 6th of March to determine whether Iran has complied with its demands and most probably make a decision to report Iran to the UN Security Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Meanwhile, an Iranian delegation will be visiting Russia on the 20th of February, as Waeedi said, to discuss Russia's suggestion for Iran to enrich uranium on Russian soil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> But this suggestion depends on the Iranians' stance who are enriching uranium in their country, something Western countries don't approve of. </seg>

<seg id="2"> By: Nasser Abu Bakr. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Ramallah, West Bank, February 15 (AFP): The executive committee of the PLO claimed on Wednesday, that the enlargement of the Israeli colonies is thwarting opportunities of realizing peace in the region, confirming its complete abidance with all the signed agreements with Israel, under international supervision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The executive committee issued a notice, at the end of their meeting today, at the premises of the presidency in Ramallah, presided over by the head of the Palestinian authority, Mahmoud Abbas. A copy of the notice reached Agence France Press: "The executive committee stood before the colonization attack, which targets the region of Al-Aghwar, in an Israeli attempt to isolate this region from the rest of the Palestinian lands, in the West Bank, under security pretexts, and overt expansionism, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> and confirmed its total disagreement to these colonization plans, which tear our Palestinian land into isolated "cantons", and forbid our people from establishing their independent state. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The notice added: "the executive committee turned towards the Committee of the Four, which issued the Road Map, to announce their stance about that colonial settlement of our lands, and the necessity to play their roles, in regards to the peace process and the solution for the establishment of two states". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It continued "The ongoing colonization in Holy Jerusalem, the Israeli barrier of racism, the isolation of the Aghwar region in an attempt to Judaize it, and the crimes of assassination, intrusion and arrests, destroying any opportunity to realize a just and lasting peace in the Middle East". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added: "It's been decided that a meeting will be organized between the High Committee, headed by Salim El Zaanoun (Abu Al-Adib), head of the national committee in the city of Ramallah, this week, to discuss preparations for the meeting of the Central Palestinian Congress, to confirm plans and decisions of the High Committee, for activation of the PLO, the executive Committee and the concerned divisions". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And it affirmed "its total compliance with all the political agreements signed with Israel under international supervision, and its devotion to international legal resolutions concerning the Palestinian problem, especially Resolution 194, relating to the rights of Palestinian refugees to return, and the resolutions of the Arab summit of Beirut." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The notice pointed out that "all Palestinian institutions must play their political and national roles, beginning with the legislative and executive institutions, protecting national interest, and international recognition of the PLO, the authority and high interests of our people". </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> Saleh Ra'fat, member of the executive committee of the PLO said in an interview to AFP: "The committee has decided to begin vast diplomatic action, on both Arab and international fronts, including the Security Council and the Council of the Four and countries bound by the Geneva agreements, for the confronting of Israeli policies aiming at the annexation of settlement clusters and the region of Al-Aghwar and the unilateral drawing of the border." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> And he added "the executive committee has confirmed that the members of the new legislative council are members of the National Committee.

<seg id="2"> Washington, February 16 (AFP). Today, Thursday, during a Congress hearing, the American Foreign Secretary, Condoleezza Rice, was forced to confess to some mistakes committed by the American Administration in the field of rebuilding Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> After Kent Conrad, democratic senator of North Dakota, showered her with questions about the results of the reconstruction program on which the United States spent more than 20 billion dollars, Rice was forced to confess two of the American Administration's mistakes. One of them concerned with training the Iraqi forces and the second with the infrastructure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Secretary, who was testifying in front of the Senate's budget committee, said the number of Iraqi Security Services now reached 227 thousand members". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> She clarified that "to be honest, we made a mistake at first when we relied on quantity, not quality. The members now available are qualified". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In her speech about the United States carrying out "the development of a big portion of infrastructure", especially at the level of drinking water and water filtering, Rice confessed, under the pressure of the Senate's questions, that the number of Iraqis who have access to drinking water and drainage systems is less than it was before the war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> She added "You are right, we concentrated our efforts on reinforcing capabilities to provide these services" and not on networks for drawing and purifying local water. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Strange Laws Adding Humor to England </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By: Jalal Malti. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London, February 17 (AFP): England has an old set of laws and customs, some are strange and others funny. They still apply, even if not imposed, but in any case their humor amazes law students. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Among these laws, one dating back to the year 1279 indicates that it is forbidden for parliament members to wear armor inside parliament. The aim of this law was to avoid fights and confrontations leading to killings, among the lords in a country with ancient democratic customs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Also, among these strange laws, is one which forbids members of parliament to die in Westminster castle, and if this happened it was a duty to carry the body out of parliament, before issuing a death certificate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Nigel Cawthorne, author of the book entitled "The Strange Laws of Old England " displayed these amazing texts, overridden with time, and clarified that this law's meaning was that "the castle of Westminster is a royal castle and whoever dies in a royal castle is entitled to an official funeral". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Members of Parliament have the right to gamble and drink alcohol in total freedom in Westminster, its library inclusive, while their citizens are fined for similar behavior, as per the law of violations in libraries (1898). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In total, more than four thousand national laws, eleven thousand local laws and thirteen thousand special laws, going back to before 1801, still apply in England. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Cawthorne said to France Press "that the tradition of the law is very important" in England, clarifying that "things are changing but at a very slow pace and laws are piled up one onto the other". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The fact is that members have enacted laws for many aspects of daily life, including its very ordinary aspects, and in the 19th century, at the height of the industrial revolution, they enacted a number of laws, aiming to organize life in the suburbs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> For instance, this caution led to the prohibition against hanging laundry in the streets, singing lascivious songs, firing guns without justification, lighting a fire in the garden, playing with paper airplanes, skating on ice, tapping on the doors of residents without justification, switching on public lights "willingly and in an illegal fashion", and other laws which became a laughing matter in our days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some of these laws are not enacted any more and haven't been since long ago, due to the progress which has taken place since their issuing, and the funniest of them is: a law forbidding you to ride a horse or a cow, or to ride in a steam car when drunk (1872). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A law dating back to the year 1867 forbids "all those living within a distance of one mile from an arms or explosives depot"- of owning a deck of playing cards. And a law issued in the year 1839, dictates punishment to whoever fires a cannon in the vicinity of a house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Kevin Martin, head of the legal assembly in charge of proposing laws which should be abolished, said: "these extraordinary examples represent the ancient history of traditional law in this country, as they prove the ongoing need to modify laws and adapt them to reality". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> More than two thousand legal clauses have been abolished since the year 1965, in a large-scale mission to modify laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> But British deputies still continue to enact strange laws, such as "the law of outer space" (1986), which cautions any British citizen against throwing any entity into space" without official authorization; space being limited to include the Moon and all other celestial bodies." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Wisdom has dictated that they empower judges to issue orders for "the use of a reasonable amount of force" to confront a possible alien invasion. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Baghdad, February 17 (AFP). Three days after Valentine's Day, a Sunni Imam, in his Friday sermon, waged an attack on Valentine's Day and those celebrating it in Iraq, saying that "it takes young people away from virtuousness to vice". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Today, Friday, most Imams of mosques in Iraq concentrated in their sermons on the photos of abuse of detainees which date back to 2004, while others concentrated on poor services and the difficulty of the security situation in the country. Except that Sheik Mahmoud Al-Sumeidaai, Imam of Um Al-Qura Mosque, concentrated on Valentine's day which the world celebrates on the 14th of this month, saying he considered it to have no relation with Islam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He said "Valentine's Day passed by, 2 or 3 days ago, and unfortunately a lot of our male and female youth do on this day what pleases the enemy, they exchange gifts and words, and it reaches the extent of exchanging kisses, this is how our enemies want us to live, away from virtue". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Valentine's Day is a very popular day in Iraq, like any other country in the world, where young men exchange candy, flowers, perfume and other gifts with their beloved ones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Al-Sumeidaai added that "Every invasion has a goal and the invasion of our country targets our youth, dragging them away from virtue to vice". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The history of celebrating this day in Iraq goes back to well before the American Invasion in 2003; a great celebration used to be held on this occasion during the rule of deposed president Saddam Hussein, and the national television channel used to broadcast special programs on this occasion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It is mentioned that the Iraqi President's son, Uday, was known for holding very big celebrations on Valentine's in the Hunting Club's halls in the high class Al-Mansour neighborhood, which used to last till the early hours of the morning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Al-Sumeidaai said that "Valentine's was not mentioned by Islam and Muslims are supposed to live according to their religion". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Berlusconi stated, in the presence of Alessandra Mussolini, "We've reached an agreement on the House House of Liberties Coalition between the (ruling coalition) and the Social Alternative" signaling the expansion of his electoral coalition with the radical right. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A solution was reached when Alessandra Mussolini and her annoying allies Roberto Fiore Forza Nuova(the New Force) and Adriano Tilgher, leader of the National Social Front, decided not to personally run in the list of "the House of Liberties" and recommended other candidates. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Brussels, February 17 (AFP). A new study carried out by Belgian researchers, entitled "Development of Terrorism in 2005" stated that Muslims are the greatest victims of terrorism committed in the name of Islam and that International Terrorism is striking the Middle East more than the West. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> From another angle, the study showed that 90% of international terrorism victims in 2005 fell in Iraq and Jordan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This study was carried out under the leadership of Rick Colsat, International Relations Professor at Ghan University in West Belgium, and was published online the "Economy" governmental website. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to the study, the number of international terrorist operations decreased significantly in 2005 compared with 2004, with 266 attacks carried out, leading to 443 casualties in 2004 while 393 attacks were carried out in 2005 which led to 733 victims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The study tells that terrorism isn't a danger having a comprehensive nature because it is mainly located in one region, which is the Middle East. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand, "local" terrorism, which is performed by citizens of a country against targets in their own country, witnessed a great increase between 2004 and 2005, where attacks increased by 90% while victims increased by 60%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The study indicated that this increase is mostly a result of the situation in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It also claimed that "the conflict in Iraq, which came about as a cause in the war on terror, led to making Iraq a center for terrorism today". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Rick Colsat, in reference to these statistics, said in a telephone call "imagine how the Islamic world looks at these statistics while the West insists that they are the ones under threat" by terrorism. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Berlusconi Finds Difficulty in Dismissing Secretary Accused of Insulting Islam </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By: Christian Spielman </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rome, February 18 (AFP). Today, Saturday, Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, got into a conflict with his allies in the Leftist Wing in order to be able to dismiss one of their leaders, the Reform Secretary Roberto Calderoli, aiming at calming the tensions which his anti-Islamic statements arouse in the Islamic World. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The prime minister asked Calderoli to resign, simultaneously emphasizing today, Saturday, that "He does not have any power to force him" to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The intended secretary replied by saying that he is willing to resign if (Umberto Bossi), (the Leftist Wing leader) asked him to and if the Islamic world carried out a peaceful initiative". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Italian Secretary is accused of insulting Islam by wearing a T-shirt, carrying the offensive cartoons of the character of Prophet Mohammed, which caused dangerous international conflict. He was wearing the T-shirt on Thursday and appeared in it during the evening news program on the Italian First Channel "Rai". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> These initiatives and more anti-Islamic accusations which he stated in a press conference on Friday, led to violent protests against Italy in Libya and the death of 10 people on Friday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Roberto Calderoli has no intention of apologizing. Today, Saturday, the Courier De La Sierra newspaper related that he said "I don't feel responsible for those who were killed". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He emphasized in a statement to a La Republica Newspaper that "The western culture is the threatened one". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Silvio Berlusconi aroused great shock in the Islamic world when he affirmed "the superiority of western culture" on the 26th of September 2001, two weeks after the attacks on the United States. He faced many difficulties in rectifying the consequences of these statements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Calderoli (49 years of age), who is a former specialist in jaw and face surgery, is considered to be one of the extremists in the Leftist Wing, the anti-foreigner movement and an ally of Berlusconi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He joined the government in July 2004, taking the place of Bossi, the Wing's leader who was forced to resign due to cardiovascular problems. The wing is in charge of 3 departments which are the Justice, Labor and Reform departments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Roberto Calderoli affirmed that he enjoys the support of Umberto Bossi and his party besides "the support of many Italians who think like me". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He boasted to La Republica Newspaper "Silvio Berlusconi asked for my resignation but I haven't resigned yet". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Italian government fears the uprising of new protests today, Saturday, against Italy in the Islamic world, let alone the reactions in Italy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Berlusconi stated that he asked the Interior Secretary, Giuseppe Pisanu, to provide surveillance on the Leftist Wing offices and emphasized that "all protection procedures have been taken to guarantee the security of Italian delegations abroad". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> As for the Italian Foreign Secretary, Gianfranco Fini, he announced his determination on visiting the Mosque of Rome today, in an attempt to calm tensions which Calderoli's statements instigated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> This is not the first time in which the prime minister has an encounter with the Leftist Wing, asking for the resignation of one of its secretaries from government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In July, 2003, he had to negotiate with Umberto Bossi about dismissing the Travel Secretary's representative, Stefano Stefani, who made offensive statements about German tourists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The encounter lasted for a week and caused a crisis in diplomatic relations with Germany, which was from the start offended by insults Silvio Berlusconi had personally directed to a German member of parliament, describing him as a Nazi Camp Guard. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> With Events, Solana Caught Between Intellect and Emotions. By: Nour El-Deen Ashour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The current tour of the Foreign Policy Envoy of the European Union, Khafyer Solana, doesn't pose any question about the possibilities of its success, as much as it turns to the question of whether he resorted to his intellect or emotions when he volunteered to attempt to calm the Islamic public's reaction after many European newspapers published cartoons insulting the Prophet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Since Solana is now in the Middle East, it seems he resorted to his emotions, after being hurt by the publishing of the cartoons and felt what Muslims feel due to the insults that reached them in the name of freedom of speech, while he didn't hesitate to announce that "as the European Union, we have a great deal of respect for Muslims... </seg>
<seg id="4"> ... and we don't want to hurt their feelings". </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is part of what the European official said after recently meeting the Secretary General of the Islamic Conference Organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "If the Foreign Policy Envoy was given the option (and this is only an assumption) to resort to his intellect, he wouldn't have troubled himself by coming to the Middle East, whether to apologize or to convince. The crisis would have been rectified in a European context since Denmark is a member of the European Union and its economical interests are under threat... </seg>
<seg id="7"> Is it reasonable that anyone would rush to the oppressed, in order to calm down and relieve, before condemning the oppressor and making them understand that what they did was unacceptable? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Was Hitler given full freedom, during War World II, to execute his aggressive plans and racist ideologies just so the Allies would be content with consoling the European peoples including the Jews? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The gravest danger posed by this matter is there being attempts to convince Muslims of the appropriateness of European conformity, which hasn't yet abolished the medium of free speech in connection to publishing the cartoons. This does not solve the crisis; in fact there are those who pay with their lives in protest against the cartoons and so Europe would have succeeded in accomplishing two things. First, dissolving the issue and keeping it in the framework of freedom of speech. Second, exporting the crisis to Islamic countries causing chaos and violence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For that reason, Solana's transformation into a man of good aspirations towards the Islamic world shows that the European Union hasn't understood the feelings of Muslims who don't deny freedom of speech, but don't want it to be a method of arousing hatred and violating religious sentiments... </seg>
<seg id="11"> When we hear of the issuing of a European, followed by an International, law which makes it a crime to attack other religions and insult sanctified entities, only then will the efforts of Solana be praised indeed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Al-Akhdar Al-Ibrahimi and Iraq's Mandela: by Asia Al-Atrous. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Because acknowledgement of failure and admission of defeat have never found their way to the dictionary of international diplomacy in general, and Arab diplomacy in particular, especially where the war on Iraq is concerned, or in terms of the incidents, events and secrets which revolved around it and still do, and which will probably not be discovered for a long period of time, what was declared by experienced Algerian diplomat, Al-Akhdar Al-Ibrahimi, regarding his "mission impossible" in Iraq, merits attention and calls for a serious pause. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> And because Al-Akhdar Al-Ibrahimi might be the only Arab Maghreb diplomat willing to take on the adventure up close, and carry out a dangerous mission, both on a personal level, and on that of his movement to an Arab country subject to occupation and ruin. It was very natural, in the context of the dangerous developments seen on the Iraqi scene, during the past two and a half years, for his mission to invite many comments about the causes and motives which can move a man of such a stature and expertise as Al-Ibrahimi to accept involvement in a role, under the American occupation authorities' control, knowing that he was clear in his stance, since the beginning, not advocating the decision to go to war, which was taken outside the framework of international legitimacy. Previously, Al-Akhdar Al-Ibrahimi tied up the success of his mission in South Africa, during the Apartheid era, to the presence of a leader such as Mandela, capable of creating the committee of truth and reconciliation and regrouping his people around him, to realize a dream which seemed to be impossible a few years earlier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Undoubtedly, when, Al-Ibrahimi, former counselor to the UN's Secretary General, who embodies a considerable history of dealing with various diplomatic activities and efforts expended in a myriad crises in many third world countries, returns to proclaim the failure of his mission and pinpoint the causes and nature of mistakes he fell prey to, in a total lack of convulsion and conceit, in so doing, he will have divested himself of the stubborn diplomatic attire, which does not allow one to be willing to appear at fault, but compels one to refuse to admit it, so that one continues to tread the path of error, because one's ego and pride do not allow one to accept this, despite the conviction that one will be subjected to repercussions and dangers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In an interview, with an Arab newspaper, Al-Ibrahimi confirmed the failure of his mission in Iraq, which he qualified as "impossible", in the wake of the different kinds of vetos to which he was submitted while undertaking his mission. Al-Ibrahimi, who still bears the title of "man of difficult missions", did not deny his feeling of unease for accepting to collaborate with the occupation authorities in Iraq in this critical situation, considering at that time that what brought him to accept this mission was the American confirmation that it is trying to end the occupation, at the soonest possible time. This was not true, and after a while it became clear that all the Americans were interested in, was not to search for a solution to the current situation in Iraq, but to search for a solution to the problem they created for themselves in Iraq, especially before the American public, who realized that the pretexts of the White House Administration to justify the war, were abstract and built upon falsified reports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Maybe what compelled Al-Ibrahimi to admit his failure was not just a single specific reason, but remains tied to a chain of causes, the most important that he realized that occupation, wherever it may be, attracts opposition and opposition attracts repression, torture and secret prisons, and that it is impossible in any case for the military option to be the required solution in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Al-Ibrahimi's confessions demonstrated a de facto state existing in Iraq for many months, not only in regards to material losses and signs of destruction and ruin, but more importantly in the volume of human losses, psychological injuries, loss and destitution, while there remains a persistent need for an influential national personality capable of gathering and unifying Iraqi ranks, which is a very important issue that will assist in escaping the current situation, and overcoming the various challenges of the coming phase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it still possible, after such a long tribulation for Iraqis, to have a review of the erroneous policies in Iraq, to salvage what is still salvageable, and provide Iraqis with an opportunity to restore their independence, away from any kind of guardianship and solutions imported via "pre-packaged" democracy? </seg>

<seg id="2"> By: Kamal Bin Younes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tunisia - Al-Sabah. Pressures have escalated on the American Administration, after the victory of Hamas by majority in the Palestinian Parliamentary Elections, that it might let go of its plans aiming at economic and political reform in the Greater Middle East, in other words the Muslim Arab World from Morocco to Indonesia, so these elections don't benefit the "Radical Trend" of the enemies of Washington and the West. </seg>
<seg id="4"> especially since all American polls </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> and European ones predict the increase of sentiments opposed to the United States' policy and the Atlantic capitals in the public opinion of the Muslim &amp; Arab World, because of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the American Administration as well as all Western Governments' siding with Sharon's Administration throughout its oppressive campaign against the Palestinian people and leaders for the past 5 years... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the "Financial Times" newspaper, American President George Bush's administration, is at the moment "reconsidering its announced plan on spreading democracy in the Middle East, after the victory of Islamic Hamas Movement in the latest Palestinian Parliamentary Elections". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The newspaper mentioned that the "new mayors" who are close to the American President, have started revising their plans for spreading democracy in the Middle East after the overwhelming victory of the Hamas Movement". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It added that ever since the results of those elections came out, "a great flow of reports and studies showered Bush's government, advising them to be careful and slow down in the matter of spreading democracy in the Middle East". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Ceasing to pressure governments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Many recommendations were also issued by conservative research and intellectual centers which support the Republican Administration in the White House, inviting them to "not pressure Arab governments", and stop supporting "the trend of imposing a pattern for spreading democracy in Eastern Europe, on countries of the Islamic region". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Supporters of anti-democratizing the Islamic Arab region, link the victory of Hamas and electoral gains which the conservative party reaped in the Iranian elections, with that of the nominees of the Muslim Brotherhood Organization by winning 5 seats in parliament for the first time in Egypt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Military and Security Alliance </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the "Financial Times" and many European and American sources, "despite the criticisms which the government directed to the Egyptian regime for breaking the law during the latest parliamentary elections", the American budget for 2007 is expected to increase the military and security aid with which Washington provides Cairo, considering it "an important ally in the war against terror".. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In other words, the priority of Washington and its European allies will be security, not politics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Alliance of Hamas with Washington's Opponents </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> This debate which will continue in European and American media will increase in intensity due to many situations, including: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The support of many governments which Washington and European capitals consider opponents of Hamas (and its upcoming government), especially Syria, Iran, Sudan, the Russia and Venezuela, and the list may get bigger to include other countries like Cuba, Korea, China and many Muslim and Arab countries... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The subjective alliance between Tehran, Moscow, Beijing and many European and Asian countries against the view promoting a siege in Iran because of the Iranian Nuclear Program. </seg>
<seg id="19"> and Tehran's external policy after the victory of Ahmadi Najad and the weakening of the moderate reform party led by Mohammed Khatami and his former Education Secretary Muhajarani... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The loss of most of Washington's liberal and secular allies in the Iraqi elections... </seg>
<seg id="21"> and the conflict's focus on the Iraqi elections, the political game and security battles between Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish trends, parties and groups, which have many conflicts, the overwhelming majority of which are of a religious nature... </seg>
<seg id="22"> ... and there is no distinguishing between Religion and Politics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Continuity of security instabilities and a series of suicidal attacks against American and Ally forces in Iraq and Afghanistan (thousands of American casualties and injured in 2005 alone) and against Israeli targets in occupied Palestine... </seg>
<seg id="24"> Despite plans supporting reform and democracy, which President Bush's administration adopted years back... </seg>
<seg id="25"> Which means that these plans, till now, did not help improve public opinion and that of radical parties in "The Greater Middle East" about Washington and its policy in the region... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Decisions of Georgia and Istanbul Summits </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It might be too early to predict that Washington will completely retreat from its great plan, which was adopted by the Group of 8 in the Georgia Summit and Atlantic Alliance Summit in Istanbul, 2004, which aims at repeating the East European scenario in the Muslim Arab world... </seg>
<seg id="28"> But many indications reveal the hesitation of American and European decision makers in continuing to support the "democratic reform" plan... </seg>
<seg id="29"> ... if this democracy is going to create forces hostile to the strategic interest of Washington and its allies in the region </seg>
<seg id="30"> and in the world... </seg>
<seg id="31"> starting with Israeli interests.. </seg>
<seg id="32"> And if this hesitation continues, the priority of Washington and its allies will once again be military security, not politics, </seg>
<seg id="33"> despite public declarations issued many times by President Bush Junior and both his former Secretary of State Colin Powell and current Secretary Rice, which attributed the main reason of the uprising of anti-Western anti-American terrorist groups to be their support, for the past 60 years, of the security option over freedom and democracy... </seg>

<seg id="2"> Tunisia, Al-Sabah: Mr. Othman Bin Arafa, president, general manager of the Tunisian electricity and gas company, said: Our country is in need, in the medium and long run, within the next two decades, of producing electricity from nuclear energy, which is considered to be the best alternative energy solution, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> avoiding current high costs, due to the constant hike in world fuel prices. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The president, general manager of "Stag", declared during a presentation, the company's strategy for ensuring the provision of energy needs of the country, for the benefit of the economical and financial committee of parliament, in the presence of representatives of the national agency for energy control, yesterday, at its meeting venue in the capital. In the near future, and at the highest level, there will be an evaluation of possible solutions for firmly confronting constant external attacks on electrical and gas networks of the company, which cause annual losses amounting to millions of Dinars and representing 50% of electrical malfunctions in Greater Tunisia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Mr. Othman Bin Arafa pointed out in this meeting, attended by Mr. Ezz Al-Deen Khalaf Allah, general manager of the national energy agency, future programs of "Stag" in the field of electricity and gas production and in particular many problems related to the services provided to industrialists. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the course of his speech outlining existing possibilities of alternative energy sources for the future, he mentioned the need for further use of solar and wind energies, but that nuclear energy is considered to be the best alternative possible to be used for electricity production, and in particular, the Tunisian electricity network being capable of carrying and dealing with the enormous power capacity produced by nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He clarified in that regard that Tunisia, has presented its demand for the use of nuclear energy, for peaceful purposes, to the president of the International Atomic Energy Agency, during a previous visit of his to the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The presentation of future programs of the company included that "Stag" was capable, during the year 2005, of producing a total energy of 156,600 tons of oil, amounting to 29 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next phase, new regions will be provided with a network of natural gas and 50 thousand new connections will join the network, all in the process of a program between 2005 and 2009, to enhance the numbers of those connected to more than 400 thousand, saving the state nearly 92 million dinars of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The company will strive to diminish the import of bottled gas in the future, through the enlargement of the Qabes factory for the production and transfer of gas, which will secure an annual profit of nearly 115 million dinars, and the enhancement of quality and billing services, relying on the newest technological mechanisms, such as the internet and the technicality of monthly direct debits for the consumption fee, which is now applied to 70 thousand connected members or through the implementation of prepaid cards, which might be more widely used in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Production of 1.25 tons of oil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As for the presentation made by the general manager of the National Agency for Energy, it mainly features the content of the tripartite program, for the mastering of energy from 2005-2008, which will see a total energy achievement of around 1.25 million tons of oil, and the saving of a state subsidy of 220 million dinars, with the provision of 70 million dinars in credits. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As to what relates to the heating of water by solar energy, in the year 2005, 22 thousand square meters were installed and the five providers in the field were approved, that is 237 installment companies, this will accumulate a total revenue for nearly 1600 tons of oil yearly, and the saving of the annual state subsidy of nearly 516 thousand dinars. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In the same period, 84 establishments handling natural gas were linked and this enabled a total interchange of nearly 100 thousand tons of oil annually, in subsidized petroleum products and the saving of the state subsidy of nearly 7.6 million dinars annually. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It's been decided that by 2008, 220 thousand homes will be linked to the natural gas network, and the generalization of economic regulating devices will allow an economizing of 30% of the energy consumption costs yearly for the councils, which equal 7 million dinars, yearly. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The generalization of energy control programs on all household electrical appliances, beginning with refrigerators: the types consuming high levels of electricity, will be progressively phased out, such as those of the type 8 and then 7, 6 and 5. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As for the use of wind energy, 160 megawatts will be installed by "Stag", as a preliminary step, to enlarge the wind station in Sidi Daoud. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> In the course of the implementation of the same program, 3 million energy-saving lanterns will be installed, between 2005 and 2008. This will allow an energy saving of 136 thousand tons of oil and the saving of subsidies worth 12 million dinars. Until now, international bids have been invited for the installment of 2 million lanterns with the possibility of the local industry providing nearly 400 thousand lanterns each month at the cost of no more than 4500 millimes per lantern. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As far as education and awareness is concerned, a month of energy-saving lanterns has been organized from the 10th till the 10th of next March, representing a campaign of demonstrations with various means, for the propagation of the energy-saving locally produced lanterns and the unifying of the selling price to the general public in all large areas, between 2860 and 4445 millimes depending on the size. It is expected that during the campaign, 400 thousand lanterns will be available. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunisia - Al-Sabah: Preliminary indicators for the Food Trade Balance for the current year have revealed that the export rate will grow by 6.15%, reaching 1187 million dollars as opposed to 1027 million dollars achieved in 2005, according to the Economic Balance of Agriculture and Fishery for 2006, in order to achieve a surplus of 197 million dollars which will result in an increase in the size of exports over imports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This improvement can mainly be attributed to the awaited increase of olive oil exports which are expected to reach 600 million dollars this year in comparison with 476 million dollars achieved last year, in other words an increase of 26%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As for other products, they are expected to achieve their earnings in comparison with last year, with an increase varying between 13% in regards to fish, while the French market has the capacity of most exported quantities, in other words 99.8%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Meanwhile, 241 tons of fish were exported for the first time last year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is in addition to the positive advancement which the dates sector is expected to witness by 4.4% this year, keeping in mind that date exports reached 45 thousand tons, with a value of 114 million dollars, last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The increase in seafood exports is also expected this year by 9.2%, reaching 18.5 thousand tons and it is worth mentioning that 18 thousand tons of seafood were exported in 2005, holding the value of 175 million dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> As for imports, this year is expected to witness stability in their total value of about 990 million dollars, which is nearly the same level of 2005, which was around 992 million dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The value of seed imports is expected to increase in value by 13%, reaching 439 million dollars, in comparison with 338 million dollars last year. This is attributed to the decline of production in this field to 1.8 million tons after making 1.2 million tons last year, according to the economic balance, while the import of other products will record a drop according to the same source. </seg>

Information indicates that they were in Iraq and were imprisoned by the American forces for six months, and one of them lost his legs in a land mine explosion. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The second group was arrested in Beirut, and comprises 13 members of various Arab nationalities, who had in their possession weapons and fake citizenship documents and called each other by aliases. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And according to security sources, they are: </seg>
<seg id="7"> One, the emir of the group, Hassan Mohammed Nabaa, who had participated in the events of Al-Denya in the year 2000, and fled to Syria. He joined his brother in Sunday's demonstrations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two, Amer Abdullah, a Palestinian barber, a mechanical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Three, Hani Hashem Al-Shanti, who is of Palestinian origin, bearer of the Lebanese nationality, and a computer engineer. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Four, Hamad Turki Al-Rabaa, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Five, Mohammed Abdel Razzaq Wafa'i, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Six, Faisal Asaad Akbar, a Saudi national. He entered Lebanon on a fake passport by the name of Fahed Mohammed Al-Khadem Al-Yamani, who fought on the side of Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, then later moved to Syria. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Seven, Mohammed Ahmed Kouja, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Eight, Tareq Al-Naser, a Syrian neurosurgeon, who accompanied some of these members to Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Nine, Ali Jihad Sharaf Al-Deen Qaser, a Lebanese whose mission is to transport explosives. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ten, Kheder Mohammed Nabaa, a Lebanese. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Eleven, Malek Mohammed Nabaa, who was in charge of collecting bags of explosives and explosive devices. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Twelve, Baraa' Mohammed Fouad, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Thirteen, Muath Abdel Ghani Shousha, a Syrian. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The information indicates that all of these are connected to a Syrian man from Homs, known as Jamil, an expert in electronic engineering, explosives and booby-trapping. He used to provide fighters heading to Iraq with weapons and money and the information also revealed that the two most dangerous members of this group, Khaled Taha and Belal Zaaroura, entered Lebanon from Syria last December, are thought to be in the Ain Al-Helwa refugee camp, and they were never arrested. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Interrogations of the members of this group are the subject of much speculation regarding its involvement in the assassination of prime minister Rafiq Hariri. The international investigation team and the American side demanded to see this information, which might have been examined by a high ranking judicial authority. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Members of this group are still in the grip of the information branch of the internal security forces, who are escorting them to the military interrogations judge to resume interrogations with them in regards to the criminal attempt to carry out terrorist acts. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Nonetheless, the method of handling this case implies that there is inside information related to the assassination, but judicial sources do not confirm this information, because they have no circumstantial evidence and they say it's all a matter of political talk, aimed at shifting accusations. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Hizbullah, which %pw refrained from participating in Sunday's demonstration, benefited from the scene of anarchy and discord to present today a contradictory picture, through an organized and lined crowd of hundreds of thousands. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And in addition to this point of order and organization, the leader of Hizbullah, Hassan Nasrallah, is relying on pushing for the meeting between Mar Mikhail and Colonel Awn in a political attack on those he called "the ones clinging to power currently", calling on them to accept the truth brought about by the latest developments, accusing some of those running the country of fomenting tension in the political and sectarian arena. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nasrallah, who senses a new-found political comfort made public a priority plan for the coming period, most importantly calling on anyone wishing to wage war with or on Syria to make use of his party or sect or group, but it is not permissible, according to Nasrallah, to drag the government or the state and its institution into a war of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, hours after the political and popular show by Hizbullah, prime minister Fouad Al-Sanioura sought to continue containing the ramifications of last Sunday, by gathering a spiritual summit to be held in the meantime in the Grand Place. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For more details, we head to live coverage from there by our colleague Donis Rahmi Fakhri. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Donis, good evening. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Good evening, George. </seg>

<seg id="10"> If %pw from %pw the members of participating sects, the Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Mar Nasrallah, Botros Sufeir, Mufti of the Republic of Lebanon, Sheik Mohammed Rasheed Qabbani, Deputy President of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council, Sheik Abdel Majid Qabalan, Patriarch Gregorios the third Laham, the Roman Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and the entire East and Alexandria and Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also participating are Patriarch Narsis Pedros the nineteenth, Patriarch of the Armenian Catholics, and Dr. Selim Sehiouna, head of the Supreme Council of the Anglican Church in Syria and Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also participating are the Metropolitan Elias Ouda, Metropolitan Paulos Matar and Metropolitan Kigham Khatshirian, as well as Metropolitan Rawlon Abu Jouda. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As for the Druz sect, judge Nihad Hreiz is participating, as well as Metropolitan Fersai Baz, Metropolitan %pw Maratnainos Ephram Barsoum, pardon me if I mispronounce the name, Metropolitan Michel Qasarji, Metropolitan Paulos Tahdah, Monsignor George Al-Masri, Metropolitan Andre Haddad, and Fr. %pw Pishoy, head of the Sacramental sect in Lebanon and Syria. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Thus, these are the names of the participants in this spiritual meeting, or spiritual summit, as you've described it, George. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The Church of Mar Maron Al-Jemmeizi, which was exposed to riotous acts last Sunday, held today the memorial feast of Saint Maron with an official celebration mass gathering various Lebanese groups, at the forefront of whom are both the head of state Emil Lahhoud and head of government Fouad Al-Sanioura, as well as a representative of head of parliament Berri. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The celebration of Mar Maron's feast comes around this year as Lebanon goes through a tough time. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The feast, held in Mar Maron Al-Jemmeiza Church, attracted all spiritual families in Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The president of the republic Colonel Emil Lahhoud attended, along with the head of government Fouad Al-Sanioura, and representing the head of the House of Representatives was Deputy Abdel Latif Al-Zein. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Also participating in the holy offering was a large number of ministers and representatives, as well as political, syndicate, social, media and spiritual figures, and ambassadors of major foreign states. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Heading the offering was Metropolitan Paulos Matar, who affirmed that it was a social tradition to pray at the Mar Maron Church in Beirut, which dated back three quarters of a century, and the continuance of which was a sign that the Lebanese people, despite their differences, are attracted to each other through love. </seg>
<seg id="7"> What is required today is not mistrust or assault, which aren't constructive, but rather love. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The security we lost in our capital in a space of hours, and people's feeling that they had no roof to shelter their necks, their livelihoods and their sanctified entities, have sharply called into question the hopes we have been entertaining for thirty years, during which we almost lost everything, and shed much blood and tears, in the hope that we and our generations would have a bright future in a secure and stable homeland, independently sovereign, an able and just nation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Is it, then, reasonable to wait so long? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Metropolitan Matar emphasized the necessity of continual dialogue, with consultation between people and via a multitude of opinions seeking the best solution, as seen by the majority of citizens </seg>
<seg id="11"> that the majority does not unite people on the basis of their religious affiliations or otherwise, but on the basis of their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And it is transferred along with the shift of power from one party to another and without any embarrassment whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The game of free minds, hearts and wills increases in value the more the group is enlightened in its rationalism and experienced in its liberty. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And undoubtedly, it is the safest basis for determining the welfare of the group, because it involves everyone in discussion and decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is also incumbent on the majority, any majority, to take into account the opinion of the minority and the elements of common grounds between them before the elements of difference. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Prayers were held on this occasion for the consolidation of love in Lebanon and peace in all its quarters. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And in Kirki, the Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Sufeir, emphasized in the feast sermon the extent of the need for solidarity in these dark days Lebanon going through. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Today we celebrate the feast of Saint Maron, the father of our Maronite Church and the best way to celebrate saints is to be guided by their life stories. </seg>
<seg id="19"> An address by the Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Botros Sufeir. </seg>
<seg id="20"> During his heading the celebratory mass in the patriarchal edifice, on the occasion of celebrating the feast of Mar Maron, there was opportunity to remind all of the life of Saint Maron, which was characterized by generosity, prayer and asceticism, as well as struggling against the temptations of the world and its vanities. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Cardinal Sfeir called on the Lebanese people to unify in these tough times. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For we are extremely sorrowful at what happened last Sunday in the capital Beirut, the destruction and demolition and violations intended to ignite the flame of strife. We thank the Lord that the citizens' awareness allowed them to evade this evil. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We congratulate our brethren and children, the Maronites, on this feast here and in their lands of estrangement, near and far, and we call on all of them to emulate the virtues of this saint, especially his fear of God, his divesting himself of the world's vanities, and his love of others. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And his very own tongue says in the presence of the Almighty: We are useless servants. Amen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Following the celebratory mass, worshippers and greeters of the feast of Maron went to the Patriarchal edifice, where Cardinal Sfeir received the envoy of the French ambassador Francois Abi Saad, and the former deputy Estefan Al-Duwei'i, in addition to a delegation from the Lebanese forces from Ghadeer. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Also giving a speech was the spokesman for a delegation of Maronite clerical graduates in Ghadeer. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Circumstances are very harsh and what's being plotted against this nation has become clear, namely that there are people who desire no rest for its citizens. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, we must unify our ranks and cling to each other, knowing full well that in unity lies power and in division weakness. </seg>

<seg id="2"> On the other hand, Washington viewed the Russian initiative, renewing its categorization of Hamas as a terrorist organization, while France viewed Putin's initiative could complement the efforts of the Quartet, despite this initiative %pw being made without consultation with members of the Quartet. </seg>
<seg id="3"> International endeavors to corner Hamas, following its victory in the Palestinian legislative elections, have been thwarted by Russia, in a noticeable position . From Madrid, Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to invite Hamas leaders to Moscow soon, to discuss the future of the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Hamas has never been a terrorist organization in our opinion. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We must recognize that Hamas has reached power in the Palestinian Territories as a result of legitimate democratic elections. </seg>
<seg id="6"> We must respect the choice of the Palestinian people by finding solutions acceptable to all Palestinian parties. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Insofar as an official of the Russian Foreign Ministry mentioned that Moscow would invite the Hamas movement to occasion a change in its radical policies to include a recognition of Israel, the Russian suggestion received an immediate welcome from Hamas. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Tel Aviv strongly denounced Putin's initiative, considering it an actual stab in Israel's back. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Israeli Minister of Education Meir Shitreet opined that the aim of the initiative was to grant international legitimacy to a terrorist organization, in his words. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Russia must withdraw from any peace negotiations in the Middle East and I suggest to President Putin that he recant his decision to invite members of a terrorist organization involved in murder. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Israeli stance matched that of Washington which expressed its reservations regarding the Russian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="13"> They must recognize Israel, shun terrorism, and adhere to international treaties signed by the Palestinian Authority, and since Russia's a member of the Quartet, we expect it to convey the same message. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Head of the executive committee in the Lebanese Forces Party, Dr. Samir Geagea, affirmed that the forces will enforce peace as barbarically as they waged war. </seg>
<seg id="2"> %pw Geagea, before the supporters of the Lebanese Forces Party in the area of Baabda-Aley, announced the continuance of work towards finding an agreeable candidate to succeed the late deputy Edmund Eid. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Dr. Samir Geagea stressed there are ongoing consultations in search of an agreeable candidate to avoid a tight election battle in Baabda-Aley. </seg>
<seg id="4"> An address by the head of the executive committee of the Lebanese Forces Party came during the meeting which gathered the cadres of the forces in the area of Baabda-Aley, within the framework of regular preparatory meetings to restructure the Lebanese Forces Party. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We are currently making great efforts to find a candidate so we avoid an election battle, although it would be a democratic battle, and reaching an agreement on a candidate who will please all parties. </seg>
<seg id="6"> You have now reached an agreement on a candidate to please all parties concerned, and of course we respect all parties concerned, especially the Free Patriotic Movement. An agreeable candidate entails that we sit in a closed room and discuss all the names suggested and those not suggested. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Those suggested and those not suggested, so that we can both, with all we represent, reach a name accepted by both sides. </seg>
<seg id="8"> As for us, this is the way to achieve accord, we sit and suggest a name, two names, three, five, ten, perhaps even fifteen or twenty, or whatever, till we reach a name amongst them that would please us and the other parties involved with the battle. </seg>
<seg id="9"> That's what we're attempting at the moment, we've finally mobilized all our energy and focused on it, and we're trying to get there. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I wanted, in all honesty and simplicity, for you to be in the picture, but at the same time I tell you, this doesn't mean not to prepare for parliamentary elections, for perhaps this attempt will not yield the required result. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Dr. Geagea also tackled two pivotal topics being discussed in political circles today, namely, the economic situation and the necessity of finding an actual solution that can be implemented, and the other topic is the policy of restraint and self-control, for which the Lebanese Forces Party is calling, in light of the latest incidents. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Today we have waged the war valiantly, and inasmuch as we waged the war valiantly, we wish to embark on peace with valiance. Peace takes far greater courage than war. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Manhood is not always the manhood we know. At times, self-control and self-restraint require far greater courage than placing one's hand on the trigger and firing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Anyone can aim and fire, but not anyone can control himself not to fire. Some take it against us that we have neglected economic and social conditions while focusing on politics. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The answer is that we cannot consider any serious economic or social solutions in isolation from the need to establish a true capable state. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Any solution you come up with, you can bring all the world's experts and they'll present you with all the solutions imaginable, but these solutions require someone to implement them. Who will implement them? They require a true capable state to implement them, which we haven't yet got. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is worth mentioning the head of the executive committee of the Lebanese Forces Party had met, at his headquarters in Al-Arz, with British ambassador James Watt for an hour, and the ambassador made no statements. </seg>
<seg id="18"> %pw I apologize %pw before we resume the news for the error made at the start of the report in regards to the stance of Dr. Samir Geagea, who assured us that inasmuch as the forces waged %pw the war valiantly, they will embark on peace valiantly.

<seg id="2"> The Chairman of the Executive Committee in the Lebanese Forces Party, Dr. Samir Geagea, spoke on the Good Day program about what he called a plan to salvage the presidency's credibility. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A versatile plan because I don't think the situation of the country can remain in its current inflexible state. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Contrary to what many think, the position of the republic's presidency is a central one. Hence, if we hope for improvement of the situation in the country, we have to start from this particular position. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The components of this plan are still being studied, of course, but its primary components will be constitutional, legislative, political and public. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Alright, and what is its duration, I mean is there a specific duration for this issue? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not much. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Not much, of course. %pw this kind of movement, this kind of strategy, I mean, no one can estimate when exactly it will end but we can estimate when it will commence. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Okay, Colonel Michel Awn considered yesterday that the extension for president Lahhoud was compulsory as was the election legislation. Do you support this comparison? </seg>
<seg id="13"> No, and %pw, honestly, this comparison is %pw not accurate and not empirical. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The extension for President Lahhoud was compulsory in the sense that the intelligence services hassled the parliamentary representatives and told them you have to sign the extension legislation while the 2000 election legislation was submitted it to Parliament. There was another submitted legislation, which is the Legislation of 1960. A political settlement took place after negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I repeat, it's not that the intelligence services seized the representatives and told them you have to go and sign the 2000 legislation. No, a political settlement took place stemming from the need for elections at that time. Well, the country will lose with a constitutional void. </seg>
<seg id="16"> %pw due to the %pw exploitation by head of Parliament Berri of his position to pass the 2000 Legislation because of how it suits him, the legislation that suits him best, the parties had to establish a political settlement. Political settlement is, of course, one thing and compulsory extension another %pw because oppression and compelling are totally different things. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus, the 2000 Legislation of which we do not approve, of course, has been passed through a political settlement that took place at that time due to the prevalent circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Parliamentary representative Botros Harb considered that Resolution 1559 puts President Lahhoud in an illegal position and was astonished by Colonel Michel Awn's call for early parliamentary elections. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Parliamentary representative Botros Harb says that the message he addressed to the Republic's President, Colonel Emil Lahhoud on Christmas was interpreted by President Lahhoud as a message of support and when he did not take the initiative to decide to step down, it became necessary for the March 14 Forces to lay open the presidency dossier seriously. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Yes of course, we hope that the President realizes how dangerous this situation is and its extremely negative consequences on Lebanon if it remains in this situation, for it is inflicting great harm on the presidency regardless of the harm affecting him personally. For the President, in any symposium any symposium we watch on TV is being addressed by harmful and insulting speech. Furthermore, the presidency's position has become absent %pw absent. I mean it does not exist in political life except in statements in response to this and that, which harms the presidency more %pw. In addition to negative attitudes in replying to legislations established by the House of Representatives regardless of whether he has the right to respond. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Harb pointed out different ways of dealing with the problem of the presidency. There are constitutional and legislative aspects as well as political and public work. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Sheikh, can we know what is the constitutional and legislative strategy adopted by you? Will you adopt what has been mentioned in Resolution 1559, in the Larsen and Melis reports? What will you adopt to remove the president of the republic? </seg>
<seg id="23"> The 1559 Resolution stipulated the necessity of holding free presidential elections that respect the provisions of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="24"> What happened in the elections the second day the resolution was issued is totally against one of the clauses of this resolution. This means that he is a president whose presence is internationally violates the 1565 Resolution and he opposes the international trend lobbyist and the international legitimacy. This, of course, is a significant loophole that might be handled politically in a manner that might place the president in an illegal status regarding the international community and thus he'd be treated accordingly. This hasn't occurred so far and the truth is we were keen it wouldn't because we suspected that we might get to this endeavor. Consequently we desired that the president himself take the initiative because he is in a very critical situation. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Sheikh, but %pw Colonel Awn, who was against the extension and was opposed to the president of the republic is reluctant now to remove the president and calls instead for a presidential election, for an early parliamentary election. What's your answer to this quote? </seg>
<seg id="26"> What's the %pw purpose of the elections? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It's to %pw %pw </seg>
<seg id="28"> The result might come out different to the current political structure so that this would have more and that would have less. That's not the aim. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The aim is to make use of the international support status, Lebanon, and from the current national situation, which was apparent yesterday, the 14th of March %pw. This national bond occurs for the first time in the history of Lebanon, for the rebirth in Lebanon, first the rebirth of the one and only free sovereign independent Lebanon. The history of Lebanon is witnessing a new thing that it would be a great loss to miss. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Men are not absent from the country. </seg>
<seg id="31"> None of us can claim to be the only virtuous person, while all the rest are wicked. </seg>
<seg id="32"> There are plenty of good people in Lebanon and there are people we agree to reconcile with. </seg>
<seg id="33"> We are primarily concerned about the welfare of Lebanon. If we agree that any person amongst us is capable of guaranteeing the welfare of Lebanon, we all have to spare our personal needs and give up our directions. On the contrary, let us exert an effort to come to an agreement on a person who believes in our common plan for building a modern country and laying the foundation of sovereignty and independence and to again spread the government's authority all over Lebanon. This is the plan we should achieve not individuals' projects. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Harb perceives that what is important in the presidency problem is not the individual, but the project and the history of the person, his ambition and ability to positively deal with all forces. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Beijing, February 9, Xinhua: The savings deposits percentage in China to date has reached 46%. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Individual monetary deposits reached 14 trillion yuans, and monetary deposits of establishments 10 trillion yuans. This attracted general attention in the local banking sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Chu Chiao Chuan, governor of the popular bank of China (the central bank), said lately that the increase in the percentage of citizens' saving deposits is tied to many factors, such as traditional education, social fabric and the family concept in China. But the lack of a social security system is the main cause behind the lack of courage of citizens to spend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Chu noted that the lack of a social security system is a temporary phenomenon. The government should hasten the reform of elderly insurance schemes, medical insurance and the education of citizens to decrease "precautionary savings", until the proportion of savings deposits to value of gross national product comes back to a normal level. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Abu Redaina stated, in declarations to the press after the meeting of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas with James Wolvenson, the envoy of the International Committee of Four, in the seat of the presidency in Ramallah in the West Bank, that "the official position is final: we do not accept any unilateral solutions, and a just and total settlement must envelope all the lands occupied in 1967, Jerusalem inclusive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> And he added, "We will not accept any final borders, only through negotiations, and we will refuse any partial solutions imposed on us from any sides, but most importantly, Israel must know that the road to security and peace will be completed through negotiations, in agreement with international authority and the return of the lands it occupied in 1967. </seg>

<seg id="7"> He said that Wolvenson, who is on the verge of a Gulf tour, promised that aid and support will continue but Wolvenson and the whole world are tied to the resolutions of the Committee of Four, and there is a cooperation guideline towards any upcoming government, asking the world community to wait until the formation of the next government, and not to impose sanctions on the Palestinian people, to avoid making matters worse than they already are. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The statement went on: "There is a decree from President Talibani and prime minister Barzani inviting representatives of the cooperating Kurdish parties to take part, and the invitation might have arrived now because it was already on its way, with the aim of including these parties. This took place during the joint contribution to the wording of the constitution, when leaders of all Kurdish parties participated in joint delegations and discussions of drafts of the constitution, so there is no exclusive control from the president or prime minister or their parties, and there is no marginalization of these Kurdish parties and their roles". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Riyadh, February 13, Xinhua: Today, the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Conference, Professor Akmal Al-Deen Ihsan Oghlo, and High Representative of the European Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana held talks, at the general secretariat headquarters of the organization in Jeddah, about the ramification of the issue of the Danish Newspaper publishing cartoons insulting the Prophet, aiming at reaching a satisfactory settlement for this case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Oghlo, the Secretary General of the Organization began by expressing welcome to his European guest and his appreciation for visiting the general secretariat of the organization during current times in which feelings of hatred and anger have risen all over the Islamic world as a result of some Western newspapers trying to degrade Islamic sanctities, with the excuse of freedom of speech, as reported by the Saudi Arabian News Agency this evening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> During the talks, the secretary general expressed his anticipation for the help of the European Union, in order to pass this crisis and guarantee the ramifications aren't repeated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On his part, Solana emphasized that his first visit to the headquarters of the Islamic Conference Organization is aimed at sending a message to the Islamic masses, expressing Europe's great respect for Islam as well as Europe's respect to the feelings of Muslims, asserting his sorrow and his apology for the ramification of the cartoon issue, the perpetrators of which were mistaken in underestimating the feelings of Muslims towards them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Solana also said that "this whole issue has no justification and we understand the responses of Muslims who experienced injustice and inequity because of it", emphasizing his genuine desire to cooperate with the Islamic Conference Organization and Islamic countries to avoid similar incidents in the future. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He added that "The world is filled today with complicated catastrophes and the last thing we want is a conflict taking place because of these cartoons, we desire to work in cooperation in order to create a secure world and discuss matters so we can arrive at setting measures which will calm the situation at first, then look into the conditions which will guarantee this incident not taking place again". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Solana pointed out the spirit of cooperation he was demonstrating and Oghlo handed him a number of legal and political proposals which may lead to guaranteeing this crisis will not happen again. These proposals involve the European Union taking legislative measures, through the European parliament, confronting the anti-Islamic attitude in Europe and expending every cooperative European and Islamic effort to take up a resolution in the United Nations' public organization, similar to that issued recently under number 15/60 concerning the "combat of religious distortion" which warns against insulting all prophets or religions. Also, adopting a code of conduct for Western media agencies which takes into consideration the sensitivity of Muslims and doctrines of religion, criminalizing slander, in any shape or form, which includes mocking prophets, so that all this is considered an immoral crime in the code of conduct of Western media agencies. As well as the United Nations taking up a universal media system, in UNESCO, which consists of introducing the limits of freedom of speech when it comes to religious symbols and including a clause in the resolution of the new Human Rights Organization establishment which bans insulting religions. Solana welcomed these ideas and promised to cooperate with the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Conference, the European Union and United Nations in order to perform them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As he also expressed his desire to hold a bilateral meeting between the Islamic Organization and European Union, supplementing the meeting which included both organizations in 2002 in Istanbul, and producing positive results in facilitating mutual understanding and discussions between the Islamic world and the West. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Cairo, February 15, Xinhua: Egyptian parliamentary sources have reported today, Wednesday, that the People's Assembly of Egypt last night approved a draft law introduced by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to adjourn local council elections for a period of two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The same National Democratic Party affiliated source stated to the "Xinhua" agency in Cairo that the People's Assembly had unanimously adopted during its session last night, Tuesday, a draft law decreeing the extension of the terms of existing local councils by two years. In practice, this means the adjournment of the elections which were supposed to take place over the next two months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The source made clear that the Assembly witnessed heated debates between delegates of the Muslim Brotherhood Party, official opposition parties, and a number of independent delegates who objected to the draft law, on the one hand, and the ruling National Democratic Party delegates on the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It also pointed out that the lengthening of the term of local councils by two years on top of their current tenure, until the next council elections, would, according to the new vision for the local administration system, and what was included in the new law articles, fulfill the requirements of the constitutional amendments aimed for by President Hosni Mubarak. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It added that holding elections now would, according to the current laws of local administration, make the newly-elected councils incompatible with what is being introduced in the new local administration laws regarding plans and rulings that support local administration, and enhance its executive and supervisory powers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The source confirmed that the two-year adjournment proposal is in agreement with a very practical consideration; that an adjournment of only one year would make the elections of local people's councils coincide with the new half-term elections of the Consultative (Shura) Council, which start in April 2007. Practical considerations dictate that this matter must be avoided. In consideration of the above, the draft law, and the attached postscript, intend for the current local people's councils to continue for two years longer than the current term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Two days ago, the Egyptian Consultative (Shura) Council approved the adjournment of local elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It has been mentioned that the term of the current elected local councils in Egypt would come to an end next April on the 15th, and according to Egyptian law, elections of local councils are supposed to take place within sixty days of the end of a term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Opposition parties and political powers in Egypt have rejected the Consultative (Shura) Council's decision to agree to the election adjournment law, accusing the ruling Democratic National Party of attempting to prevent them from entering the elections, and of marginalizing their role in the local arena. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A statement issued by the organization and sent to Xinhua said that the messages were directed to the American Assistant Secretary of State, David Welch, the United Nations Secretary-General's envoy, Alvaro de Soto, the European Union special envoy to the peace process, Marc Otte, the Russian envoy to the peace process, Alexander Kalugin, and to ambassadors, consuls and representatives of the European Union, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Canada, Australia and Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The statement indicated that the messages emphasized that "the ongoing acts of aggression will destroy any chance of peace, and will stand in the way of establishing a Palestinian state within the borders set on June 4, 1967, in addition to the fact that they comprise the framework of a policy of imposition and injunction on the land instead of negotiation." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> The statement emphasized that "isolating the Al-Aghwar the region means preparing to merge it with Israel, and the decision entails a great human crisis which will see the banning of 2 million Palestinians from a region whose area is three times that of the West Bank." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The statement added that "the completion of the expansion and annexing wall has created a racist system in the West Bank, annexing East Jerusalem and isolating Al-Aghwar; the increase in settlement activity and the take-over of water resources means that the Israeli government is implementing a long term transitional scheme, or a state of temporary borders in the hope of a long term truce". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The statement also warned that "the implementation of these plans would result in a humanitarian, agricultural, educational and healthcare catastrophe for all residents of Al-Aghwar, as the Israeli settlers, numbering eight thousand, have taken control of water resources and most agricultural lands in Al-Aghwar, as well as constructed industrial colonial residential zones, and those related to the presence of livestock." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Indonesia Emphasizes Iran's Right to Nuclear Technology for Peaceful Purposes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Jakarta, February 17, Xinhua: The Indonesian Presidential spokesman, Dino Patti Jalal, said today that, during the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Directors meeting on the February 4, Indonesia refused to vote for the referral of the Iranian nuclear program to the Security Council. This was for two main reasons: the first being Iran's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, and the second, the Indonesian demand for assurances that there exist no Iranian plans to produce nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In a press conference this evening. Friday, the Indonesian Presidential spokesman added that Indonesia made its decision not to vote on the basis of its personal outlook and interests as an independent country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He stated that all countries who have signed the nuclear non-proliferation agreement, including Iran, have the right to develop nuclear programs for peaceful purposes, and hoped that Indonesia would receive assurances from Iran that it would not use nuclear technology for military purposes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He made it clear that the international community was still, for the moment, divided about the Iranian nuclear issue. The Iranian nuclear program was referred to the Security Council on the basis of a vote which took place during the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Directors' meeting, in which 27 countries voted for the referral of the file to the Security Council, 3 countries voted against it, and 5 countries abstained from voting, among them Indonesia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Why Do We Muslims Insist on Application of Human Rights to Islamic Minorities in West, When We Refuse Same For Christians in Countries Where We Are Majority? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Written by Dr. Yousri Moustafa, an anti-terrorist Islamic author. </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If our Islamic governments, who adopt Islam as a source of legislation, do not support human rights, specifically the performance of religious rituals for the minorities, it is an understandable thing. But the consideration of human rights as suspicious by a few elitist and popular groups, far from the governmental space, needs to be considered and explained. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We have noticed, in the expanse of years gone by, that one the greatest challenges confronting human and women's rights groups is the inclusion of human rights in a culture that still refuses to recognize the principles of human rights and their internationality. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As we know, the main grounds for the refusal of human rights are represented by cultural specificity; the proclamation arguing that 'our societies are different in their values to those of human rights', qualifying them as being of a foreign source and nature. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In any case, the difficulty in promoting a culture of human rights is not only due to the state's restraints, but also some general cultural restrictions, fed by cultural specificities that aim to deprive human rights of their international legality. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In reality, this cultural rejection is a factor not to be ignored, and which contributes, in non-governmental spheres, to strong political and ideological turmoil. Better than ignoring it would be to research its causes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I believe that if human rights principles are not striking a chord in our societies, it is not due to their strangeness, but our unfamiliarity with their legal and political makeup, and the handling of human rights with double standards. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is clear to anyone familiar with them that human rights are not to be refused in their totality, but only in some areas. Collective rights, for instance, are acceptable, as well as political rights. Even if it worries the government, they will find attentive ears in the opposition, including those who promote a discourse of cultural exclusion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Individual rights, these are the real hurdle. They provoke the supporters of cultural specificity and exclusion, not only within governments, but also in political and ideological forces allied with the authorities, creating antagonistic public opinion towards the internationality of human rights, all in the name of specificity. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When we talk about the right to our own development, we sense universal satisfaction and accuse the westerners of using us. But when we talk about the right to form political parties, the opposition responds, and the government gets angry. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But when the issue concerns the freedom of thought and belief, or women's individual rights, the proponents of cultural exclusivity deprive human rights of any legality, considering them to be Western ideas. Thus the desire for cultural independence is not against human rights in general, but only partially and selectively, especially when those rights are concerned with individual freedom. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Therefore, if we wish to search for the reason that human rights principles lack cultural validity in our societies, we must start by examining our cultural and political positions on individual rights. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is our task to seize the thread at its beginning, beginning with the question of the extent of the individual rights' legality themselves, before discussing the legality of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The edifying article by the German philosopher Habermas, entitled "The Increase of Legality through Human Rights" states that modern laws originate essentially in individual rights. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These individual rights allow the individual to behave, within the law, according to his private priorities. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hence these rights cause a person to dispense, and in a better and amended way, with moral instruction or tutelage of any kind. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In any case, no-one is legally obliged, within the allowed legal boundaries, to to publicly account for his actions. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Habermas points to the inclusion of individual rights in modern legal constitutions. As a result, it has become different from the traditional legal system that confirms Hobbes' theory saying that everything is allowed which is not explicitly forbidden; thus law and ethics are separated. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The separation of law and ethics in modern legislation is an important matter. Not because we love law and hate ethics, but because this is the modern historical logic of the principle of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This separation has historically allowed the grouping together of people with legal backgrounds in line with the concept of individual rights, versus traditional frameworks, wherein ethical people are grouped and governed by the edicts of traditional morality, based on religion, customs and traditions, or even modern political ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And if modern law is based on the principle of individual rights, the moralistic dialogue depends on a pluralistic interpretation of rights and duties. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In reality, when a matter concerns the individual, in our society, we find ourselves living a tridimensional existence: first, we have legality, imposed by historical development which we cannot deny, and laws governing us, even if they detract from our common and individual rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Secondly, in parts of the civil code, religious people, moral people and terrorists mingle. For example, laws of civil status or, freedom of thought and belief, or the practice of religious rites of minorities. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thirdly, we are people, obedient for the greater part of our lives, to finite moral rules. They have more power than laws, especially when the matter concerns individual rights. </seg>
<seg id="26"> To a certain extent, freedoms not limited by law are limited by morality, to the detriment of the law. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The example for that is the religious mass orations. where the decision maker interferes to impose upon the individual a way of life in the context of established rules and moral vetoes, which are illegal and through which the lives of individuals are organized, being qualified as moral beings. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some people imagine that legal rules are in a continuous struggle with moral ones. This is not true for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Law and ethics meet in a positive fashion when law and ethics criminalize together, in the case of murder, and theft, for example. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But they also meet in a negative way, to curtail freedom and individual rights. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In our societies, law lags behind, only in its repressive forms, and leaves center-stage to moral rules. This is not because it competes with them, but because these rules play an active role beneficial to the authorities; that is, the difficult task of social control, specifically in the context of individual rights and freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="32"> According to this disciplined scheme, an alliance takes place between the three authorities: political, religious, and traditional authorities. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Whatever cannot be legally controlled, becomes morally controllable, and some sort of punishment will befall the individual even if he does not break the law. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It is remarkable that this method of control relies on moral punishments which might develop into plain brutality. Individuals are classified, not on the basis of their abidance by or defiance of law, but on the basis of a moral particularity, relating to the "Pure and Impure" in their primary meaning. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The religious address to women relies on a sort of moral division. It says that the veil means virtue and purity, and consequently, that those who do not wear it will be socially and culturally punished, and considered as having lost their validity in relation to virtue and purity. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We also find this kind of division within political ideologies. We hear talk about honorable citizens, referring to those who do not follow this political line as just citizens. If they oppose, they expose themselves to the risk of being judged dishonorable citizens. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The language of virtue, purity and honor includes a sort of illegal punishment for the puritans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Here appears the crisis of the legality of human rights. The language of human rights is basically a human and legal language, designed for the address of legal beings living under a political and legal system, and based upon citizenship that recognizes individual rights and protects them. </seg>
<seg id="39"> But the problem, as already shown, resides in the fact that the legal body itself does not acquire a cultural legality, and is substituted with basically moral entities. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And accordingly, the discourse of human rights enters a sphere alien to its language and legal vocabulary, and cooperation with it is carried out in a selective fashion, wherein the collective is accepted while the individual is refused. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The true legality of human rights can be established only when there is universal recognition of their legality. </seg>
<seg id="42"> This recognition will not happen as long as there are authorities who fear human rights, and individuals who ignore the language of the law, which is the language of human rights, and adopt the language of morality, which is the language of political and religious power, and the authority of custom and tradition. </seg>
<seg id="43"> This highlights the importance of defending citizenship, not by qualifying it as simply tolerance and common life, but by conceptualizing it as a project of civil rights, and once again considering the legal institution as based upon individual rights and freedoms. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Cows Make Mistakes! </seg>
<seg id="6"> Badriya Al-Abd Al-Rahman 2/1/1427 01/02/2006 </seg>
<seg id="7"> I know that my topic is the Islamic arena's hottest topic at the moment... </seg>
<seg id="8"> It might be repetitive for many of you to speak about the Danish foolishness which ignited the feelings of Muslims all around the world .. how can we decipher and dampen an escalating situation that threatens terrible outcomes... </seg>
<seg id="9"> What is the story? </seg>
<seg id="10"> How can we appropriately analyze this unique act? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Can it be read, for example, as a blunt awakening of religious fanaticism in an era of tolerance and moderation? </seg>
<seg id="12"> Or is it more the blunt awakening of anti-religious fanaticism against religion and religious symbols? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Even stranger is this happening in a peaceful and calm country, clearly isolated from the international arena... maybe it's political stagnation, (!) and geographical remoteness from countries with intellectual and societal clashes with Muslims in particular, or just other societies in general; it is a matter that inspires debate, </seg>
<seg id="14"> for a particular magazine to make an attempt (even if exceptional) to provoke the anger of the followers of Islam, which millions practice worldwide... </seg>
<seg id="15"> What's worse is for all this provocation to take place not for the sake of any good, or to move the stagnant discussions with the "other", but to create Islamic stereotypes, to which we can attach accusations and specific preconceived notions of our religion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was all a scene of (Danish) stupidity, and of great oppressiveness, which I do not think will pass through history easily... and I don't think that the country of cows and butter, with it's highly pleasant image, needed to boast - when it wanted to boast - by provoking Islam and Muslims of different sects... </seg>
<seg id="17"> Why Islam alone...? </seg>
<seg id="18"> The greatest symbol of this religion is its noble Prophet, peace and blessings upon him. An impudent picture of stereotype has been marketed about Islam, describing it the religion of bombs and death in a very clear way, in a clearer than clear way. The duty of cartoons in newspapers is to confirm an agreed upon, real and current idea, and none can dispute this except the foolish. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Like this we are simply cancelled, and the long history of a major religion is cancelled by a cartoon insulting only to us, from all other religions and intellectual groups in the world. In the name of many of them, outrage and crimes have been committed against the whole world, but Islam is the only one remaining on the death list. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This is how sanctity is insulted and fanaticism rises up to above red line, exceed it by hundreds of meters without shame or intellectual judgement. It is as if religions have become unsalable products and goods which bear no resemblance to what they stand for, perform and effect in the hearts of their followers... </seg>
<seg id="21"> In a nutshell, it is impudence and impertinence in terms of thought, politics, and every known convention. Nothing can describe this foolishness, except to say it is impudence, after which Denmark should not await any foolish act to be taken against it due to this impudence, because in short it was more disobedient and unjust. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Rue this picture, not only because it is false and ugly, but also because it awakens many issues that have been turning the Western mind against the Muslim for many centuries. The Islamist represents death, the sword, horses and beheading in the way of Allah, and no more. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now they have been aroused, and the partial harmony which Muslims in the West enjoy, especially in Denmark, destroyed, all because of a few radicals (of any intellectual party) who do not realize the danger of what they have done. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For God's sake, what has Denmark done to itself? </seg>
<seg id="25"> And how does it expect to gain our respect after all that has happened? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can it now protect its citizens who live in Islamic countries, or anywhere else, considering the bitter anger which Muslims now feel? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Just some questions, which I don't know if they passed through the minds of Denmark's general public and legislators. Are their minds still too occupied milking their cows and spreading their butter, unaware of the magnitude of the problem that has been caused by the editorial staff of a magazine, and which has now become the template for every Danish person in the mind of every Muslim. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We boycott in order to be </seg>
<seg id="29"> The united messages via SMS and e-mail to boycott Danish products and defame them, is a healthy and good step which I support without any restrictions... </seg>
<seg id="30"> Ever since we boycotted American and Israeli products, the Arab mind has been jumping and creating his many, strong and at sometimes very hard "No"s.. But in a pleasant method which arouses interest even if we differ with them. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The international mind must understand that the Muslim is no longer one of a group of countries, whose majority belongs to third world, whose issued are decreed (when Taym is absent, no one leading them and they are witnesses).. But he has become an educated person, aware of his cultural background which is the Islamic religion, regardless of its different sects and varying duties towards religious rulings... </seg>
<seg id="32"> Most importantly he now knows how to say No in a civilized loud voice and in a way that describes his restlessness from western arrogance which encircles westerners against Arabs, whom they need, resort to and line up in queues to obtain visas to work there. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Western arrogance which has lengthened, continued and finally overwhelmed to the extent of insulting sanctities. Sanctities that are big red lines in all cultures and the right of every person to oppose insulting them with sarcasm and belittling. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When I say this, I know that my, you and our boycotting won't affect or lessen the importance of Danish butter, it's widespread reputation or stupid cows. But we will do it for ourselves, so we don't lose the only simple "No" which we own now and speak </seg>
<seg id="35"> Let us say: We are present and existent on this planet despite all our problems and crisis. We are able to live peacefully together, deserve respect, have the right to express and reject and even hate if the matter requires so. </seg>
<seg id="36"> So that new disturbance and hatred isn't aroused in the ocean of hatred which this planet swells in, I wish Denmark takes the initiative to a widespread and deep apology to the feelings of Muslims and calms down the size of this crisis. </seg>
<seg id="37"> And not to wait for what is in Muslims' hearts to be wiped away in one go and by one apology, because the shock's size was great and removing it won't be easy </seg>
<seg id="38"> Because if this apology doesn't happen, we will spend all our life playing on this musical tune, experiencing the pain of hatred and upbringing our children that Denmark and Satan are brothers, whatever applies to one is applicable to the other. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If the apology doesn't take place, the embers of hatred will remain lit. Denmark might even be surprised by a matter because it provoked Muslims' feelings. It might find a good practical example of the sampled tough terrorist with the turban (of a bomb) in its land, between its beautiful towers and heavy cows. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Denmark might lose it's beauty and simplicity because of (the length of its tongue) </seg>
<seg id="41"> Its cows might have blabbered in a (more stupid) fashion this time... </seg>
<seg id="42"> We might not need more than the next couple of days to witness something in Denmark which we didn't wish before </seg>
<seg id="43"> Everything might happen (here or there) </seg>
<seg id="44"> How much I hate (might) in these contexts, Oh Allah save us from their evil. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; FW: Negative and Positive Self-Programming </seg>
</hl>

<seg id="5"> Negative and Positive Self-Programming </seg>
<seg id="6"> Most people are programmed, from an early age, to act, speak and believe in a certain negative way. It grows with them until they become captives of what is called "Negative Programming", which limits them from gaining many things in life. </seg>
<seg id="7"> We find that many say: "I am weak in character", "I can't quit smoking", "I am a bad speaker", I am... </seg>
<seg id="8"> We usually find they have acquired this negativity from their family, school, or friends, or all of the above. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Is it possible to change this negativity with positive programming? The answer is yes, a thousand times yes. But why do we need to? </seg>
<seg id="10"> We need to program ourselves positively in order to be successful and happy, and to live a pleasant life, in which we fulfill our dreams and goals. Especially considering that we are Muslims, and we have a duty and goal which we must reach so that we may attain the favor of Allah, the Exalted, and achieve the Caliphate which Allah gave us in the land. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Before we start the course in changing negative programming, we must agree on some things: </seg>
<seg id="12"> You must decide within yourself that you want to change. This decision of yours is what will illuminate the path to change from negativity to positivity. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Repeat the sayings and actions which will be introduced to you and make them a part of your life. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now, the first way to positive programming is: </seg>
<seg id="15"> Speaking to yourself: </seg>
<seg id="16"> Have you ever seen a person talking to himself in a loud voice while walking, moving his hands, mumbling, and maybe even swearing and cursing? Sorry, but we do not want to do this. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Or has it happened that a big argument took place between you and someone else, and afterwards the argument is replayed like a tape in your mind? You start to imagine the argument once again, replacing words and expressions with others, all the while asking yourself "why didn't I say such and such?"... </seg>
<seg id="18"> Has it happened that while you were listening to a lecture or sermon, you said to yourself "I could not lecture like this person", or "How could I stand in front of so many people", or "It is impossible for me to stand in front of people and lecture or give a sermon"? </seg>
<seg id="19"> All these conversations and talks with the self and soul bring a person to negative programming, which might, in the end, result in evil acts. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Luckily, you and I and any person, are able to react to speaking with the self, and we are able to change negative programming so that new programming, which will give us power, can be established. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A psychoanalyst has said: "at any moment, we are able to change our past and future by reprogramming our present". </seg>
<seg id="22"> So from now on, pay attention to the inner voice which speaks to you. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It has been said: </seg>
<seg id="24"> Mind your thoughts because they can become actions. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Mind your actions because they can become habits. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Mind your habits because they will become your nature. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mind your nature because it will determine your destiny. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I would like to clarify some scientific facts about the human mind, and concentrate on the unconscious mind. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The unconscious mind does not understand things as does the conscious mind, it simply stores information and repeats it later, when it is drawn from its storage place. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If it happened that a message was programmed many times in this mind, and for a long time, such as saying in every situation, "I am shy", "I am nervous", or "I can't play sport", "I can't quit smoking" and the like, these messages would become deep-rooted, and would settle at a deep level in the unconscious mind, making them difficult to change. But they can be replaced with healthier positive programming. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Another fact is that the unconscious mind has strange traits that we must be attentive to. For example, if I said to you "don't think about a black horse", can you do that and prevent your mind from thinking? Of course not, you will immediately think of a black horse. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Why ? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Your mind cancelled the words "do not" and kept the remainder of the expression, "think about a black horse". </seg>
<seg id="34"> So is it possible to utilize these strange traits of the mind? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Let us present it to you in a nutshell, and allow Doctor Ibrahim Al-Faqi to tell us the rules and practical methods of positive self-programming, as he talks about in his book 'The Power of Controlling the Self'. </seg>
<seg id="36"> He says: </seg>
<seg id="37"> I present the five rules of programming your unconscious mind: </seg>
<seg id="38"> 1- Your message should be clear and precise. </seg>
<seg id="39"> 2- Your message should be positive (for example, "I am powerful", "I am healthy", "I can quit..."). </seg>
<seg id="40"> 3- Your message should be in the present (for example, don't say "I will become more powerful", but rather, "I am powerful"). </seg>
<seg id="41"> 4- Your message should be accompanied by a strong will concerning its contents, so that your unconscious mind can accept and program it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> 5- You must repeat the message a couple of times until it is totally programmed. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now here is the plan, so that your message to yourself will have a positive effect: </seg>
<seg id="44"> Write down at least five negative messages that have had an effect on you, for example: </seg>
<seg id="45"> I am a shy person, I can't quit smoking, My memory is weak, I can't speak in front of crowds and I am nervous, etc. Now tear up the paper on which you wrote these negative messages and throw it far away. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Write down five positive messages that will give you power, always starting with I, for example: </seg>
<seg id="47"> "I can quit smoking"... "I love talking to people"... "My memory is strong"... </seg>
<seg id="48"> "I am an excellent person"... "I am active and have a lot of energy"... </seg>
<seg id="49"> Write down the positive messages in a small diary and keep it with you at all times. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Now, take a deep breath and read the messages one by one until you understand them. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Once again, start with the first message, take a deep breath, let out any nervousness, read the first letter ten times with strong feeling, close your eyes and imagine your new self, then open your eyes... </seg>
<seg id="52"> Starting from today, mind what you say to yourself and to others, and mind what others say to you. If you notice a negative message, cancel it by saying "cancel", and replace it with another positive message. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Rest assured that you have power, that you are able to be, and able to do, what you like by determining exactly what you want and moving in this direction with all your power. Jim Rohn, author of "Everlasting Happiness", said about this that "repetition is the basis of all skills". </seg>
<seg id="54"> That is why you should be confident in what you say, always repeating to yourself the positive messages. You are the master of your mind and captain of your ship. You control your life and are able to change your life into an experience of infinite happiness, health and success. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And always remember: </seg>
<seg id="56"> Live every moment as if it's the last moment of your life. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Live in faith, live in hope. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Live in love, live in struggle. </seg>
<seg id="59"> and give value to life. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Adapted from Doctor Ibrahim Al-Faqi's book, 'The Power of Controlling the Mind' </seg>
<seg id="61"> Finally I ask for guidance, forgiveness and mercy. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Amen </seg>
<seg id="63"> Your brother in Allah. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Causes and Treatment of Dandruff. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I think it is a very common problem that everyone suffers from at some point in their life. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Back in the day, it was believed that dandruff was caused by the rapid growth of the scalp's cells, but this belief has been proved wrong. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was discovered recently that the cause of Dandruff is a type of yeast called Pityrosporum Ovale. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The problem arises because of poor blood circulation in the scalp. </seg>
<seg id="10"> concern </seg>
<seg id="11"> Use hot water to wash hair </seg>
<seg id="12"> The oily nature of hair plays a major role </seg>
<seg id="13"> Sometimes dandruff does not cause any problems worth mentioning, but when it falls on clothing, causes an itch, or gives hair an undesirable odor, problems start to arise. </seg>
<seg id="14"> An elegant look and prestige goes with the wind, and dandruff becomes a question in need of an answer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The question is, how do we treat it? </seg>
<seg id="16"> There are general pieces of advice of which we must first be aware, and they are: </seg>
<seg id="17"> 1. Do not use other people's tools to do your hair. </seg>
<seg id="18"> 2. Look after your personal tools; in other words, wash your brush and comb at least once a week. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 3. Wash your hair with certain types of treatment Shampoo, available at various outlets. </seg>
<seg id="20"> I recommend the use of Nizoral shampoo, not for the sake of advertising, but because this shampoo contains Ketoconazole, which is effective in destroying the yeasts that cause dandruff. </seg>
<seg id="21"> 4. After using the shampoo, rinse your hair with vinegar diluted with water, while massaging your scalp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In addition to this, there are some very effective prescriptions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Wash your hair. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wash your hair with apple vinegar. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Leave it for 15 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Rinse it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Wash your hair. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Mix half a cup of apple vinegar with half a cup of lemon juice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Massage your scalp with this mixture. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Keep the mixture on your head for half an hour. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Rub your hair with olive oil and leave it there for another 15 minutes, then wash your hair with shampoo. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Repeat the procedure once a week to get rid of dandruff; you might not need more than once a week. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Olive oil, almond oil and cactus oil help restore scalp's balance and provide nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Greetings, and may you remain in good health. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Sufferings in the Red Sea. </seg>
<seg id="6"> My father put on me the safety ring buoy when he saw the ship tilting and about to sink. </seg>
<seg id="7"> After that I saw my father drown, then my mother, </seg>
<seg id="8"> I remained alone for 30 hours, fighting the waves with the help of another survivor, until the rescue squad arrived and pulled me out of the water. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everything was lost, </seg>
<seg id="10"> I was an expatriate in Saudi Arabia for three years in which I suffered bitter hardship. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I returned with my life savings, to get married and settle down. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But suddenly everything was lost... everything. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A fire ignited in the basement of the ship. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The crew prevented some passengers who saw the fire from wearing life vests, under the pretense that it would cause a state of panic for other passengers for which there is no need. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Then the result was as you saw. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ship sank and with it drowned more than a thousand passengers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> When we saw smoke coming out of the engine room in the basement, the ship's crew told us not to worry, as they would put it out. </seg>
<seg id="18"> When things got much worse, we didn't find the rescue boats because some workers on the ship had taken them and left us on the ship to encounter death on our own. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I was in water for 30 hours, fighting death... </seg>
<seg id="20"> 30 hours without food or drink. </seg>
<seg id="21"> May skin was close to dissolving. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Where is respect to our humanity? </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the ship's passengers were Israeli, would they have handled the issue with the same degree of negligence or tardiness? </seg>
<seg id="24"> Allah blessed me with 3 kids, 2 daughters and 1 son, and we used to live in Saudi Arabia together. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Then we decided to finally come back and settle down in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I shipped my house furniture, my children's books and all our stuff. </seg>
<seg id="27"> After a while of sailing, fear overwhelmed us when seeing smoke ascending from the ship, </seg>
<seg id="28"> then it tilted to one side and sunk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> I saw my 3 children and wife screaming and swallowing water while I was screaming and trying to save them, but Allah's fate was supreme. </seg>
<seg id="30"> They all drowned in front of my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Their books and some of their toys floated to the surface. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Lord alone compensates us... </seg>
<seg id="33"> There is no might or power, but Allah's </seg>
<seg id="34"> When the fire expanded, we heard explosions in the kitchen of the ship. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We thought it was the result of gas cylinders blowing up. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We yelled for the captain to return to the Dhaba port because it's closer than the Safaga port, but he refused. </seg>
<seg id="37"> After we were overwhelmed by fear, the Captain ordered us to knock on doors to get passengers out of their cabins and gather them on the right side so the ship could regain its balance. But within 5 minutes everyone was drowning. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Screaming and wailing escalated. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The men were calling for Allah's help, "Oh Lord save us... Oh Lord be merciful upon us." </seg>
<seg id="40"> " </seg>
<seg id="41"> Others were reciting the two testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="42"> ***** </seg>
<seg id="43"> May Allah be merciful on the victims of the accident and grant their parents patience and consolation. </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt; Chastity of Men </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt; Abu Sulaiman </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Why doesn't the chastity of men have value or respect any more? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Why does a chaste man, who elevates himself above his lusts, become astonishing and suspicious? </seg>
<seg id="5"> Why is the man who hasn't engaged in illicit sex before marriage considered stupid in the opinion of some? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Why is the man who doesn't betray his wife considered a coward, who fears his wife discovering his affair, or whose masculinity is doubted? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Our societies lend great importance to the virginity of women. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But why doesn't anyone speak about the virginity of men? </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the era of liberalization and development, there's been a spread of means facilitating sin. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Temptations have surrounded us from every angle, making them ever easier </seg>
<seg id="11"> to reach, for there is nothing easier than wrong conduct which drags people to vice. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But this is not an excuse to justify sin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Even though both women and men are exposed to the same temptations, they are equal in reward and punishment. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to the divine rule where He said :(Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty, and say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Since it is most correct and just for our conduct to be measured according to divine rule and law, we find in the Qur'an a clear indication, generalizing this concept to both males and females... </seg>
<seg id="16"> Allah said: "For men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah's praise , - for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward." [Al-Ahzab:35] </seg>
<seg id="17"> So men's chastity is no less important than that of women and it doesn't lessen their masculinity, so as chastity is required of women, it is also required of men. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We must broaden the concept of virginity to include both man and woman, so a balance can be achieved. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But in our Eastern societies where concepts have become unbalanced, </seg>
<seg id="20"> chastity is only required of the woman, which is all she possessed and the basis of her family's dignity. </seg>
<seg id="21"> As for man's chastity, speak freely with no embarrassment. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There's nothing wrong with him, starting from the notion that any sin is allowed if it doesn't expose him in the eyes of people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is an invitation for everyone to seek chastity, refrain from committing sin, </seg>
<seg id="24"> and get rid of the widespread concept that man's chastity is an obscurity of which he feels ashamed and from which he steers clear, so he is not accused of stupidity, lack of education and little experience. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man's chastity means his conservatism, and it is a great characteristic by which he preserves his faith and becomes righteous, refrains from sin and Allah's wrath and guards his health from disease. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chastity begins in the heart then expands to the body. In man, it is a clear sign of his strong character, being far superior to, and refraining from, indecent acts, suppressing lascivious desires and controlling himself from following his whims. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A chaste man is a rational one, who is able to control all his desires and instincts, and who doesn't allow himself to satisfy them, except in that of which Allah approves. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He is a patient righteous person who is far superior to falling into vice and excels high above his lust. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He possesses rare morality, which no one can sustain, except those of strong faith. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the Qur'an, there is a call to every bachelor. </seg>
<seg id="31"> {And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste} </seg>
<seg id="32"> Thaalab explained it by saying: </seg>
<seg id="33"> Discipline yourself with fasting, for it is protection. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Chastity is required from both the married and unmarried. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Many are the men who betray their wives and boast in their gatherings about their adventures so that they don't appear in front of others as lower in status, lesser in masculinity or an object of mockery. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Dear brother, I ask you not to become weak and to preserve your purity and chastity, </seg>
<seg id="37"> and not to weaken in the face of temptations. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Try to increase your faith in Allah. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If you become weak, remember that Allah sees you, you will be questioned and so will we, about our actions and your masculinity won't intervene to make Allah forgive you, the divine words are clear. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Chastity isn't a requirement for women alone, but obligatory upon every person. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Don't make the society judge your deeds. </seg>
<seg id="42"> If you are saved from the judgement of this world, you can't escape punishment in the hereafter. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Remember that death doesn't seek permission before taking one's life. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Whenever it comes, it won't give you a chance to repent. </seg>
<seg id="45"> And when its term cometh, they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance it. </seg>
<seg id="46"> فان رضيت باخبث الاعمال فلا تنتظر ولا تطلب الطيب من الرزق </seg>
<seg id="47"> and remember that reward is from the same class as deeds </seg>
<seg id="48"> If you are inflicted, don't awaite Allah to send you with a righteous wife </seg>
<seg id="49"> Allah says in Al-Nur chapter (Vile women are for vile men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women; such are innocent of that which people say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision.) </seg>
<seg id="50"> " </seg>
<seg id="51"> Oh Allah, I ask you modesty and satisfaction </seg>
<seg id="52"> " </seg>
<seg id="53"> We ask Allah to keep away all harm and evil from Muslim youth </seg>
<seg id="54"> Allah is better at guarding, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. </seg>

<seg id="4"> And deprived her of her senses... </seg>
<seg id="5"> She felt that she was placed on what seems like a howdah... in its height and motion... </seg>
<seg id="6"> She heard the voice of her beloved amongst them... </seg>
<seg id="7"> Why isn't he rebuking them... ? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Why is he not preventing them from taking her... ? </seg>
<seg id="9"> The sound of monotonous steps treading on rough soil... </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cool morning breezes caress her white clothes... </seg>
<seg id="11"> Even though she can't see, she imagined the climate around her to be foggy... </seg>
<seg id="12"> and imagined the ground she's on now, to be a deserted empty lot. </seg>
<seg id="13"> .. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At last the steps stopped all of a sudden and she felt she was placed on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Beside her, she heard rocks lifted and others put down. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She was lifted again... Silence enveloped her... She felt the darkness gnawing at her bones... </seg>
<seg id="17"> From above she heard a crying voice... it's her son... yes, it's him. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Maybe he's coming to save her? </seg>
<seg id="19"> But what does she hear? </seg>
<seg id="20"> He calling out to her in a low voice: Mother... </seg>
<seg id="21"> Amid his tears, her husband tells him: Be patient </seg>
<seg id="22"> Patience comes only with the first shock... </seg>
<seg id="23"> Supplicate for her my son... </seg>
<seg id="24"> Let's go... </seg>
<seg id="25"> Agony overwhelmed him.. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He took a last glance at the deceased body... he couldn't control himself, but said in a voice full of pain: There is no God but Allah... </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is no God but Allah... </seg>
<seg id="28"> We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return... </seg>
<seg id="29"> That was the last of what she heard from him... </seg>
<seg id="30"> A marble rock echoed, falling from above to block the only opening that was the source of sound, light and life... </seg>
<seg id="31"> The sound of footsteps faded away... </seg>
<seg id="32"> Where to? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Where are you leaving me? </seg>
<seg id="34"> How can you leave me in this loneliness and darkness? </seg>
<seg id="35"> She looks around and sees....... </seg>
<seg id="36"> sees?!!! </seg>
<seg id="37"> What can she see in this black cellar ? </seg>
<seg id="38"> Its darkness isn't like that of night to which she was accustomed... The latter is accompanied with moonlight and rays of stars reflecting on objects and people... However here she can barely see her hand, in fact she feels her eyes are completely closed... </seg>
<seg id="39"> She remembered her beloved ones... </seg>
<seg id="40"> She heard the footsteps fade away entirely and a tremor flowed in her limbs... </seg>
<seg id="41"> She rose to catch up with them... </seg>
<seg id="42"> How can they leave her when they know she is afraid of the dark and of loneliness? </seg>
<seg id="43"> But a heavy hand pushed her down forcefully... </seg>
<seg id="44"> She gazed behind her with great fear... She saw that which she hadn't seen before. </seg>
<seg id="45"> She saw terror manifested in the image of a creature. </seg>
<seg id="46"> But how can she see him despite the pitch black? </seg>
<seg id="47"> In a trembling voice she asked: Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="48"> She heard a voice on her right echoing loudly: We came to question you. </seg>
<seg id="49"> She turned around... </seg>
<seg id="50"> It was another creature similar to the first... </seg>
<seg id="51"> She helplessly fell silent... </seg>
<seg id="52"> She wished the earth had swallowed her and that she'd never seen these creatures. </seg>
<seg id="53"> But she remembered that the earth really had swallowed her... </seg>
<seg id="54"> She wished to die, to escape this reality from which there is no escape... </seg>
<seg id="55"> She was perplexed at her own aspirations which were of no more use... For she is dead to begin with... </seg>
<seg id="56"> Who is your Lord? </seg>
<seg id="57"> Huh? - Who is your Lord? </seg>
<seg id="58"> My Lord? </seg>
<seg id="59"> I worshipped none but Allah all my life. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What is your religion? </seg>
<seg id="61"> Islam is my religion. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Who is your prophet? </seg>
<seg id="63"> My prophet....... ? </seg>
<seg id="64"> She squeezed her memory... </seg>
<seg id="65"> Why did she forget his name? </seg>
<seg id="66"> Didn't she always utter it with her tongue? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Wasn't she accustomed to evoking blessings on him five times a day during Testimony? </seg>
<seg id="68"> In an angry tone, the voice repeated the question: Who is your prophet? </seg>
<seg id="69"> One moment please... </seg>
<seg id="70"> I can't remember... </seg>
<seg id="71"> A great rod in the hand of the being rose... descending quickly towards her head... </seg>
<seg id="72"> She screamed........ </seg>
<seg id="73"> Her organs grew stiff... </seg>
<seg id="74"> Suddenly his name illumined her mind. </seg>
<seg id="75"> She screamed at the top of her voice: My prophet is Mohammed. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Mohammed </seg>
<seg id="77"> She closed her eyes hard, but........ nothing happened. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Deadly silence... </seg>
<seg id="79"> She opened her eyes in wonder. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The being whose name is Nakir said to her: A supplication you always used to recite saved you (Oh, Turner of Hearts, make my heart firm, on Your path). </seg>
<seg id="81"> Her body trembled... </seg>
<seg id="82"> She wanted to smile in delight, but couldn't... </seg>
<seg id="83"> This is not a matter for smiling... </seg>
<seg id="84"> Oh Lord, when will these harsh moments end....... ? </seg>
<seg id="85"> After a while Munkar said to her: "You used to be tardy in the Dawn Prayer..." </seg>
<seg id="86"> Her eyes widened... </seg>
<seg id="87"> She knew there was no escape from this one... </seg>
<seg id="88"> because it was incorrect... ??? </seg>
<seg id="89"> He pushed her in front of him... </seg>
<seg id="90"> She wanted to cry, but didn't find an outlet for tears.. </seg>
<seg id="91"> She walked in front of Munkar and Nakir in a long tunnel until she got to a place similar to a prison. </seg>
<seg id="92"> ... </seg>
<seg id="93"> She felt nauseous. </seg>
<seg id="94"> She wished she fainted... but it didn't happen... </seg>
<seg id="95"> She continued to examine the terrifying place... </seg>
<seg id="96"> In every spot there was screaming and blood... </seg>
<seg id="97"> Wailing and destruction... </seg>
<seg id="98"> bones breaking... </seg>
<seg id="99"> bodies burning... </seg>
<seg id="100"> and cruel faces, from whose hearts mercy had been removed, not answering all this pleading. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The two angels pushed her from behind and she walked, feeling her feet would no longer hold her... </seg>

<seg id="1"> &lt;HEADLINE&gt;Method of Converting Cassette Tapes to CD </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> &lt;POSTER&gt;  Mr. AbuEin </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> After the coming of the cassette era, it became close to impossible to free our homes of the tapes. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Due to the ease of use of cassette tapes, they became prevalent at home, in cars, in offices, and everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Some of these tapes were originals, recorded in a professional way and of a higher cost, while others were recorded at home. These recordings might be valuable for their sentimental associations, copies of a song or other reasons. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Now we have entered the digital era, but that doesn't mean we need to negate our memories </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is possible to transfer these audio recordings, whether they are on cassette tape, quarter-inch tape or on record, and convert them to a digital MP3 format on digital discs. This will make it possible to listen to them on computer or CD player, and send them anywhere via e-mail." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Preparing the devices and tools: </seg>
<seg id="9"> To be able to convert cassette recordings to digital format on compact discs, you must set up your computer with the necessary tools and programs, in order for it to be capable of the job. In addition to this, you must have a relatively new computer, equipped with a sound card. </seg>
<seg id="10"> To begin, you must connect your cassette player to the computer. This is usually done using a common cable, as explained in the picture below. This cable is available at any store that sells electrical appliance accessories and is usually cheap. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One end of the cable should be connected to line-out, and the other end must be connected to the line-in of the computer sound card. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You also need a program able to record the audio signal coming through the line-in of the sound card. </seg>
<seg id="13"> One of the best and easy to use programs is Music Match Jukebox, which has many practical capabilities, and, most importantly, can be found free online. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Download and install this program on your computer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You can visit the program's website to download it onto your system. The website is : http://www.musicmatch.com/ </seg>
<seg id="16"> Or from this link. Its size is 9 megabytes. Click here to download the program. </seg>
<seg id="17"> To be able to use the recording anywhere and to save the considerable space audio takes up on the hard disk, it is best to have a CD burner. </seg>
<seg id="18"> CD burners are also able to read CDs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> These devices use two types of discs. Both these types are able to record audio information or data related to computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first is writable discs, and the second is rewritable. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The second type is better, but higher in price, by a couple of times, than the first. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Starting the job: </seg>
<seg id="23"> Step one: </seg>
<seg id="24"> After you have installed the MusicMatch program and connected the stereo with the sound card via the mentioned cable, you can start recording by following the steps below: </seg>
<seg id="25"> Run MusicMatch program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> From the top menu, select in sequence: Options, then Recorder, then Source, then Line-in, as shown in the following picture. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Now a new window will be displayed under the first window. If it does not appear, click the REC button. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In this window you will see the two words album and artist. Click them, and edit the name of the new album name that you will create. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Now, click on the record button (REC) in this window, and start playing the cassette tape on your stereo. </seg>
<seg id="30"> When the recording finishes, click the stop button. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The recording should be finished and saved in the program's Music Library. </seg>
<seg id="32"> You can repeat these steps for any other recording. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Recordings are automatically saved at a rate of 128Kbps, which is more than enough for most cassette recordings that require high quality. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Once the first recording finishes, you must check it and make sure. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the recording is distorted or too soft, you can adjust the input volume level from the stereo to the computer, or by using Windows itself. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the bottom of the screen, on the taskbar, you will see a speaker icon "like a trumpet". Double-click it, and adjust the volume using "play control" or "volume control". </seg>
<seg id="37"> The "record control" window will be displayed. Select Options, then Properties, then Recording, and finally OK. Select the volume level required. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Make sure you don't use the Mute button, otherwise you won't get anything at the end. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In this program, you can use extra options related to recording to adjust the various aspects and improve the audio. To do this, select from the menu Options, then Settings, then Recorder, then Advanced. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In this box, select the sound effect you desire, such as faders or others, so you can produce MP3 recordings like those of professionals. </seg>
<seg id="41"> With more experience in this program and frequent use, you will become more knowledgeable, and the task of converting old analogue recordings to digital will become easier and faster. </seg>
<seg id="42"> After preparing your MP3 audio track, whose total duration should be 74 minutes at most, you can start making an audio compact disc. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Step two: </seg>
<seg id="44"> After selecting and gathering enough MP3 recordings, you can put them in a list to be recorded on the compact disc, organized as you desire. </seg>
<seg id="45"> On the right hand side of the MusicMatch Jukebox window, you will find the Recording List. </seg>
<seg id="46"> To copy a song or musical track to this list, you can use the mouse to drag any file from the Music Library to this window. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In general, compact discs (CDs) contain up to 74 minutes of audio. (MusicMatch programs aren't compatible with the new 80 minute CDs) </seg>
<seg id="48"> After preparing the musical tunes you want to record on the disc, click the CD button. A new window or box will be displayed, containing many options for recording the CD. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Make sure you select Audio (default) as the type of CD you want to make. If you select the other option, you will be able to store more than 600 megabytes on the disc, but this type does not work with common CD players. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The status bar displayed at the bottom of the screen informs us how much space is left on the disc. </seg>
<seg id="51"> You can add to and remove from the list of recordings you wish to record on the CD by using "test then write CD", in order to produce a more refined CD. </seg>
<seg id="52"> You might also want to leave a second or more between the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="53"> When you are ready to copy, put a blank CD in the CD burner, and click "create CD." </seg>

<seg id="5"> Examine Allah's mercy upon you, so you may learn humility and examine His kindness and concern for you. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Allah says in a sacred hadith: "Between Myself, humankind and Jinn is a gaping chasm </seg>
<seg id="7"> I create and others are worshipped. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I provide and others are thanked. </seg>
<seg id="9"> My good deeds to creatures are rewarded with their evil ones. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I provide them with bounties to get closer to them, although I can dispense with them. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They distance themselves from Me through sin, while they are in dire need for Me. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Those who remember me will be in My company, he who wants to be near Me must remember Me. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The people who obey Me are those who love Me. </seg>
<seg id="14"> I don't exclude the disobedient from My mercy. If they repent to Me then I'm their Beloved, and if they refuse then I'm their Discipliner, afflicting them with calamities to purify them from faults. Whichever of them comes to me in repentance, I receive him from far away and whoever turns his face away from Me, I call him from nearby saying: 'Where are you going?' </seg>
<seg id="15"> Do you have another Lord besides Me? </seg>
<seg id="16"> A good deed, I reward tenfold and more. An evil deed, I punish once and forgive. By My Majesty and Glory, if they asked pardon for them, I would forgive them." </seg>

<seg id="3"> One thousand new members daily. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The new site MySpace steals the limelight from Google. </seg>
<seg id="5"> www.myspace.com </seg>
<seg id="6"> A new rising star has been shining lately in the internet world, particularly after it was successful in making for itself a name that reverberated widely in technical circles. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This newcomer has attracted many visitors and users in the span of only two years, surpassing all expectations, with the number of its users and visitors exceeding that of internet giant Google by a factor of two and a half. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The new MySpace site has asserted its existence and become one of the most important communities on the internet. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The secret to the site's success lies in the transformation of its predecessor's mistakes into strengths, and this has made it very attractive to the youth market, and in particular, to students and musicians, because it allows them to fully interact with their friends and make the most of services provided by other sites available in one place. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some may question the secret to the site's success, given that it is not the only one in its field.  But, quite simply, why would users turn to other sites when all their friends are on MySpace, particularly given the encouragement and insistence the users receive from their friends to join them there? </seg>
<seg id="11"> It also surpasses its competitors in its ability to be individualized, which allows the user to give his/her page a personal touch through the use of background colors, sketches, pictures, videos and lots of other characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The site has introduced a new way of communicating with your acquaintances and friends.  The special homepage has abolished the need to download emails and chat programs. Through this page the user can access chat and private emails, and also listen to their teachers and lecturers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Amidst all this success, the danger of the internet for teenagers emerges to throw its shadows on the success of the site, particularly when the number of underaged participants accounts a quarter of the total number of users. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Many school students around the United States have been suspended after threatening their school mates via the site.  Moreover, police in one state discovered illicit/unlawful relationships involving underaged children, who were introduced via the site to men falsely claiming to be much younger than they actually were. This has forced some parents and guardians to ban their children from using the site for fear of them being exposed to these dangers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, this has not deterred the owners of the site from making further developments, equipping it with global/international services to expand its user base, and to attract users from all over the world, raising the banner of "we will do anything to keep our users". </seg>

<seg id="4"> 1- Drink lots of fluids, up to 2 liters daily. </seg>
<seg id="5"> 2- Don't sit in a room full of dust or smoke. </seg>
<seg id="6"> 3- Don't get too close to the monitor (the monitor should be away from the eye, </seg>
<seg id="7"> at a distance of at least 60 centimeters) </seg>
<seg id="8"> 4- Sit in a position which doesn't make your eyes tired (where your head is above the monitor's level) </seg>
<seg id="9"> 5- Give yourself a break every hour for 10 minutes and look out the window, at the couch, fridge or anything soothing, away from the sharp and bright colors of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="10"> 6- Winking a couple of times an hour helps eyelid muscles to relax. </seg>
<seg id="11"> 7- Make sure the amount of light in the room is adequate. </seg>
<seg id="12"> 8- Don't stare for long without blinking (should be once every five seconds). </seg>

<seg id="3"> This is Love. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Raissiah: General: Wednesday 9 Muharram 1427H - February 8 2006 AD, the Islamic Agenda: </seg>
<seg id="5"> So that Muslims know the importance of their Prophet, God's blessings and peace be upon him.....and for their knowledge about true love towards this great Prophet.......come these stands </seg>
<seg id="6"> Abu Bakr, agreed by God... </seg>
<seg id="7"> Here are the sentiments, expressed by the heart of our master Abu Bakr, in the words reading: </seg>
<seg id="8"> Our master Abu Bakr says: We were migrating, and I was extremely thirsty. I brought a container of milk and presented it to the Prophet, God's prayers and peace upon him, and said to him: "Drink, O Prophet of God!" </seg>
<seg id="9"> Abu Bakr says: The Prophet drank until I was satiated. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Do not be misled by your eyes </seg>
<seg id="11"> ...and the word was true and intended. And this was how it was reported by Abu Bakr El Siddiq. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Did you taste the beauty of this love? </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a special kind of love. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Where are we from this love!? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Listen to this and don't be overwhelmed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is love </seg>
<seg id="17"> The love of the Prophet, more than yourself,, </seg>
<seg id="18"> The day of Mecca's occupation, Abu Qahafa (the father of our lord Abu Bakr) converted to Islam. His conversion was very late and he was blind. Our lord Abu Bakr took him to the Prophet, to proclaim his conversion to Islam and his allegiance to the Prophet, God's blessings and peace upon him. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Prophet said: O Abu Bakr! You should have left the old man at home, we could have gone to him. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Abu Bakr replied: But you are more worthy to be visited, O Prophet ofGod! </seg>
<seg id="21"> So Abu Qahafa converted to Islam, and our lord Abu Bakr El Siddiq wept. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He was told; This is a joyous day, your father has converted to Islam and has been saved from fire, why do you cry? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Imagine.. What did Abu Bakr say? </seg>
<seg id="24"> He said: I would have preferred that the person who swore allegiance to the Prophet now to be Abu Talib, because this would have been more pleasing to the Prophet. Praise God! His wish for the happiness of the Prophet was greater than his joy for his father. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Where are we now, from all this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Omar, (who found grace in the eyes of God) said: We were on a stroll with the Prophet and some of his companions, the Prophet took my hand and we walked. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Omar said: I found myself saying "I swear by God, Oh messenger of God, that I love you". </seg>
<seg id="28"> The Prophet replied: More than your son, Omar? </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said: Yes. </seg>
<seg id="30"> He said: More than your family, Omar? </seg>
<seg id="31"> I said yes. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said: More than your wealth, Omar? </seg>
<seg id="33"> I said yes. </seg>
<seg id="34"> He said: More than yourself, Omar? </seg>
<seg id="35"> I said no. (Take a look at his honesty with himself and with the Prophet, God's blessings and peace be upon him.) </seg>
<seg id="36"> The Prophet said: No, Omar, your faith will not be complete until you love me more than yourself. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Omar said: I left, meditated and returned shouting, "By God, O emissary of God, I love you more than myself!" </seg>
<seg id="38"> The prophet said: Now, Omar, now. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Abdullah Bin Omar said: What did you do, father, to return with this decision? </seg>
<seg id="40"> Omar said: Oh son, I went out asking myself who I was going to need most on the day of redemption, myself or God's emissary? </seg>
<seg id="41"> I found that my need for him was greater than my need for myself. </seg>
<seg id="42"> I remembered how I was in perdition and God saved me through him. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Abdullah Bin Omar told him: O father, even if you forget everything about God's emissary, what is the thing that you will never forget? </seg>
<seg id="44"> Omar said: If I ever forget, I will never forget the day when I went to him asking for his permission to go on pilgrimage. </seg>
<seg id="45"> He told me: Do not forget us in your prayers, my brother. </seg>
<seg id="46"> And he said a word that pleased me more than anything in the world. </seg>
<seg id="47"> It's not only the reader who will feel these words. </seg>
<seg id="48"> They are, by God, feelings which need a heart full of love for the Prophet, God's blessings and peace upon him, to be received as they are ... eyes closed and fresh. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thawban, loved by God. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Prophet was away for the whole day from our lord Thawban, his servant. When he came back, Thawban told him: I missed you, O emissary of God, and wept. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The Prophet asked him: Is this what makes you cry? </seg>
<seg id="52"> Thawban said: No, emissary of God, but I remembered your position in paradise, and mine, and feared the worst, </seg>
<seg id="53"> and God's words descended (those who obey God and his prophet are among those for whom God provided Prophets, the speakers of truth, and the martyrs, and the good people will be treated as companions). From the Surat "Women". </seg>
<seg id="54"> Sawad, loved by God. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Sawad Bin Ouziah, the day of the battle of Ohod, was standing in the middle of the army. The Prophet addressed the army and said: Be mature and honest. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The Prophet noticed that Sawad was undisciplined. </seg>
<seg id="57"> And the Prophet told him: Toe the line, Sawad. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Sawad said: Yes, God's emissary, he stood but was still not disciplined. </seg>
<seg id="59"> We heard a moaning sound from the young man, to leave the Prophet, </seg>
<seg id="60"> The Prophet came, saluted with his stick, and poked Sawad in his stomach. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Sawad said: That hurt, O emissary God, God did really send you to lead me. </seg>
<seg id="62"> When they built him a pedestal, the young man left and went to it. </seg>
<seg id="63"> and we found the prophet, coming down from the pedestal,returning to the young man ! </seg>
<seg id="64"> He said: Toe the line, Sawad. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The Prophet (PBUH) used to give his sermons at the mosque, before the erection of the pedestal, near a tree trunk, and was seen by the assembly. The prophet stood, holding the young man. </seg>
<seg id="66"> What is your opinion about this love? </seg>
<seg id="67"> And finally, do not strive to be less than the young man. </seg>
<seg id="68"> He said: Oh emissary of God! I believe that this day is a day of martyrdom, and I am elated that in my last commitment to you, your skin touches mine. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The Prophet replied to him: Do you not wish to be buried here with me in paradise? </seg>
<seg id="70"> The young man fell silent. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Sawad embraced the Prophet's abdomen, kissing it, and said: This is my wish. </seg>
<seg id="72"> The prophet freed his abdomen and said: Repent, O Sawad. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Headline: Why does Quran Mostly Address Males? </seg>
<seg id="5"> The respondent is Doctor Mohammed Bin Hussein Al-Jizani, member of the teaching board in the Islamic University in Al-Medina Al-Nabaweya. </seg>
<seg id="6"> New classification, Date: 01/12/1427 A.H. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Question: In the Quran, we usually find Allah addressing men, and the same is true of the prophet's hadith. Why so? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Answer: Praise be to Allah, peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, and now... </seg>
<seg id="9"> This question has been asked by the Mother of the Faithful Um Salma - may Allah look kindly upon her - when she said: "I asked the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him -: 'Why aren't we mentioned in the Quran as much as men?'" </seg>
<seg id="10"> Allah's words were revealed: "Lo! Men who surrender unto Allah, and women who surrender, and men who believe and women who believe..." [Al-Ahzab:35]. On the authority of Ahmed (26575) and the Al-Tabari Interpretation (22/10). </seg>
<seg id="11"> Since the Holy Quran was revealed in the language of Arabs, and came in the same style as their speech, women are included in the speech directed at men; because Arabs set masculine over feminine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> One would say: "Enter and exit", in addressing all those present, males and females. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It wouldn't be correct in Arabic to say: Enter (male) and enter (female), exit (male) and exit (female). </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is clear from the evidence and purposes of Sharia that calling for adherence to Sharia duties is as much the responsibility of men as of women, so both are so commanded, addressed, held accountable, rewarded and punished. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is the uniform basis and general rule, and in that males and females are on a par. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, there are some rules only applicable to males, like prohibiting gold and silk and the compulsory performance of Friday prayer and Jihad. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Just as there are some rules only applicable to females like hijab, taking care of children and other rules which the nature of each gender necessitates. Allah knows best. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Allah's wrath upon he who Muslims cannot exact revenge upon, such as he who insults or hurts the Messenger. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyya said: "And the wrath of Allah upon those who Muslims cannot punish for insulting Allah and His Messenger; Allah will take revenge on him for his Messenger and saves him from it... </seg>
<seg id="5"> and the story about Allah destroying these insulters one by one is known and narrated by people in history and exegesis. They are, as has been told, from the heads of Quraish; among them is Al-Walid Ibn Al-Mughira, Al-Ass Bin Wail, Al-Aswadan Bin Al-Mutallib, Ibn Abd Yaghouth and Al-Harith Bin Qays. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) wrote to Kisra and Qaysar and neither accepted Islam. But Qaysar honored the edict of the Messenger of Allah (peace &amp; blessings upon him) and honored the Messenger, so his rule remained firm, and it is said that rule belongs to his descendants to this day." </seg>
<seg id="7"> Kisra tore the letter of the Messenger of Allah (peace &amp; blessings be upon him), mocked the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), so Allah killed him after a while, stripped him of his reign, and there has since been no rule in the family, and this Allah knows best. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Consider the common saying: "The flesh of scholars is poisoned", then imagine the flesh of the Prophets, peace be upon them. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is in the Sahih of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon Him, that he said "Allah the Exalted says: "He who shows enmity towards a friend of mine, whoever he is I shall be at war with him". So imagine he who shows enmity towards the Prophets? </seg>
<seg id="10"> And whoever it is, he shall be at war with Allah. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If you read the stories of the Prophets in the Qur'an, you find that peoples were destroyed if they hurt the Prophets or confronted them with obscene words or actions. The people of Israel were one such group, humiliation was forced upon them because they deserved Allah's wrath, and they were shown no mercy for unjustly killing the Prophets and pagan impiety, as Allah mentioned in his book. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You will not find anyone who hurt a prophet and did not repent, for Allah would inflict upon them a calamity. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We have mentioned that Muslims have tried to hasten revenge upon the infidels if they resorted to insulting the Messenger of Allah, peace &amp; blessings be upon him, and we witnessed such a thing in many different cases. This is a vast field that cannot be comprehended, and we did not intend to mention it here, but rather make clear the legislative rule. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Similar to this is what has been narrated to us by just Muslims from among people with expertise in jurisprudence about what happened when they tried many times to surround fortresses and cities on the coast of Damascus. They spoke of the Muslims who surrounded them: "We used to surround a fortress or city for a month or more, usually unable to conquer them, and we would be about to give up, and then it's people would curse the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, and insult his dignity, and then the conquest would happen faster and more easily, and would not be delayed more than a day or two or from that time." Then the place would be conquered by force, causing a great massacre. They said: "We used to receive good news about the hastening of the conquest when we heard them insult him, while our hearts were full of anger because of what they said about him. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A similar story was told to me by some trustworthy fellows, that Muslims in Morocco are in the same situation with the Christians, the rule of Allah is that sometimes he punishes his enemies himself, and at another times it happens at the hands of his faithful servants. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Allah, the Exalted, protects and saves him in every way from harm and the insults of people, even in words: </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the Saheehayn from Abu Huraira the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, said: "Does it not astonish you how Allah protects me from the Quraish's abuse and curses? They abuse Mudhammam, and curse, while I am Mohammed". Allah elevated his name and title above insult and directed the curse at the insulter. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What proves that insult is a great crime, being a sign infidelity and enmity - it is both - is that the prophet, peace and blessings upon him, used to forgive those of the hypocrites who hurt him, as clarified earlier, even though he had the right to kill them, as mentioned earlier in Abu Bakr and others narrations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> If insult were merely apostasy, then the offender should be killed like any apostate. It is known that the right of the Prophet, peace and blessings upon him, in forgiving him can have priority over insult. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Proof that insult is a singlular crime: if a Dhimmi insulted one of the Muslims or Mu'aahadin and breached the covenant, the insult of that man would have been a crime for which he deserved a punishment unlike that of breaching the covenant; the insulting of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, is less serious than insulting one of the people? </seg>
<seg id="21"> He also said: "Purifying the land of insults to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, is obligatory so far as  possible, because it is part of spreading the religion of Allah and upholding the word of Allah. Since the whole religion is dedicated to Allah, whenever there appears an insult to him, and amends are not sought from he who produced it, the religion will not be spread and nor will the word of Allah be held high. In addition, it should be purified from fornicators, thiefs and bandits according to one's ability, different than purifying it from infidelity which is not obligatory due to the permissibility of people of the book testifying !!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="22"> The land must be purified of every crime according to one's ability, and a set punishment assigned to the one committing it, in Islamic law, if it doesn't have a certain !!! </seg>
<seg id="23"> ـــــــــــــــــــــــ </seg>
<seg id="24"> (1) This was during his time, may Allah be merciful upon him. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The mockery of Qaysar's descendants to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, during our time, is good news concerning the end of their kingship and rule, with the permission of Allah. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Is a Muslim allowed to read the Qur'an, or mention the name of Allah, in his heart (in contemplation), without uttering it, in the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="4"> The answer: </seg>
<seg id="5"> Thanks be to Allah </seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. There are two ways to extol Allah: verbal extolment, such as reading the Qur'an and glorification and supplications, which believers are encouraged to apply according to Sharia; and secondly, extolment in the heart, which is done in contemplation of Allah's majesty and powers, and of the creatures of Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, or by reciting the Qur'an in silence. There is no reward in the latter, however, as the reward is linked to reading the Qur'an, which is done only with the tongue. The same is true of supplications, it is necessary to utter them out loud; it is not enough to keep them in the heart. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Scholars have differentiated between the two forms of extolment, saying that it is loathsome to mention Allah out loud in the bathroom, due to Allah's glorified status. As for extolment in the heart, it is not abhorred and there is no harm in it. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The difference between the two types is indicated by the fact that scholars have agreed that a person in a serious state of impurity is allowed to recite the Qur'an by heart, but reciting it aloud is prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Al-Nawawi said: "It is agreed that if a person in a serious state of impurity contemplates the Qur'an in his heart without using his tongue, he would not be committing the prohibited act of reciting by such a person." Al-Nawawi's interpretation in Sahih Muslim (103/4). </seg>
<seg id="10"> Ibn Al-Munthir reported in Al-Awsat: "And Ekrema said that Allah's name is not to be exalted by mouth while in the toilet, rather it should be exalted in the heart." Al-Awsat (341/1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> The permanent committee stated: "It is part of Islamic rituals for a man to remember his Creator whenever he wants to enter the toilet or the bathroom, by saying before entering: "Oh Allah, I seek refuge in You from evil and maliciousness", and not to mention Allah's name after he enters, but to stop mentioning His name as soon as he enters. "Permanent Committee Fatwas" (93/5). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz said: "Extolment in the heart is allowed at all times and places, in the bathroom or outside it, but what's abhorred is, in the bathroom and its likes, to practice extolment of the tongue to glorify Allah, except for mentioning of the name of Allah during ablution, which one should do if one has trouble performing ablution outside the bathroom , as it is a duty according to some scholars, and a confirmed sunnah according to the majority. "Sheikh Ibn Baz Fatwas" (408/5) and Allah is the Omniscient. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Britain: Arrests in Several Cities and Explosion of Suspicious Car. Links Established between the Failed London and Glasgow Attacks, and Fears of New Imminent Attacks.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> While British security services were put on high alert over the possibility of further attacks, Peter Clarke, head of Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Branch, has declared that the investigations into the three failed attacks in London and Glasgow were "extremely fast-moving".</seg>
<seg id="3"> Meanwhile, the new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has indicated that there may be a link between "Al Qaeda" and the two car bombs found in London and the failed Glasgow attack.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Official sources have confirmed that there is a link between the three attacks.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The police have raided and searched houses in Glasgow, Staffordshire and Liverpool, raising the number of detained suspects to five, including the two occupants of the Cherokee SUV who drove the flaming vehicle into the terminal of Glasgow airport, in an attempt to blow it up.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The police announced that yesterday they carried out an explosion of a suspicious car parked near Paisley Hospital, near Glasgow (Scotland), the same hospital where one of the perpetrators of the failed car attack on Glasgow Airport was being treated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, the police have arrested a man and a woman in their twenties in a car on the freeway in Chester, and another man aged 36 in Liverpool.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Israeli Spy Vanunu Sentenced to Six Further Months in Prison for Violating Restrictions Placed on Him Since His Release.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli nuclear spy, was yesterday sentenced to six months in prison for violating the restrictions placed on him since his release in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Israeli authorities had imposed restrictions on his release, including a ban on leaving the country or talking to the media or foreigners without obtaining prior permission from the Shin Bet internal security service, which claimed that he was still capable of threatening state security by revealing more classified information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The court in Jerusalem found Vanunu guilty of having contact with foreign nationals and journalists and of attempting to leave Israel for Ramallah, all of which constitute a violation of the restrictions imposed on him since his release in 2004 after spending 18 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In addition to the six months' jail sentence, he also received a six months suspended sentence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In its ruling, the Court said, "Although he violated restrictions imposed on him 14 times, the court decided to be lenient and sentence him only to six months in prison".</seg>
<seg id="7"> Vanunu had been facing a penalty of seven years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Jerusalem Court stated that "the accused had declared that he considers" the restrictions imposed on him by the Israeli judiciary to be "illegal".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Vanunu was released in April 2004 after spending 18 years in prison, but the courts drastically curtailed his freedom of movement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Israeli authorities believe that he possesses sensitive information from the time when he used to work at the Dimona nuclear reactor in the Negev Desert (South).</seg>
<seg id="11"> He was convicted after revealing Israeli nuclear secrets to the British "Sunday Times" newspaper in 1986.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Mordechai has made several appeals to the Supreme Court to lift these restrictions, but without success.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A Moroccan-born Israeli who worked at the Israeli reactor near the city of Dimona in the South of Israel from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Vanunu insists that he has nothing new to reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Vanunu has converted to Christianity and no longer considers himself an Israeli. He has unsuccessfully applied for asylum in western countries several times since his release and complains that he is subject to permanent surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Hebrew State has never admitted to possessing nuclear weapons, yet foreign experts confirm, based on Vanunu's evidence and that of other individuals, that it possesses around 200 nuclear warheads and far-ranging missiles.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Ban Ki-Moon Withdraws His Report on the Sahara after Controversy Surrounding Its Content. The Report Focused on the Moroccan Initiative and Ignored the Proposals of the Polisario.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has withdrawn a report he prepared on the negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario front which took place last month in New York, following the controversy which resulted from the fact that the report mentioned the Moroccan initiative calling for granting autonomy to Western Sahara, without mentioning the Polisario proposal calling for a referendum on self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Ban Ki-Moon stated that the report needed to be revised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Morocco did not immediately comment on the news, while Spanish sources reported that the Polisario and supporting countries, particularly Algeria and South Africa have protested, particularly after Ki-Moon's report called on the Front to abandon its ambition and to discuss the autonomy plan proposed by Morocco. This prompted the Secretary-General to withdraw the report from the official website of the United Nations, in order to amend it to forestall any escalations prior to the next round of negotiations to be held on August 10 in New York.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Last week, Rabat sent implicit messages to the Polisario and the international organization, in which it declared that it would not be prepared to negotiate on any proposal other than that of autonomy.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For his part, Ahmed Boukhari, the Polisario representative to the UN, stated that "there are two proposals on the table and both parties will deal with them."</seg>
<seg id="7"> "There's no room for other recommendations or observations that instead of helping the process could create problems for it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Following the controversy caused by the report, a statement issued by the United Nations said that "for the benefit of the process" Peter Van Walsum, the special envoy of the Secretary-General will  submit an oral report to the international Security Council rather than a written report.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Third Republican Senator Joins the List of Critics of Bush's Policy in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2"> Domenici Called for a New Strategy and Blamed the Iraqi Government for the Failure.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A prominent Republican senator has joined the ranks of critics of George Bush's policy in Iraq, calling for a new strategy just days before a new confrontation in Congress</seg>
<seg id="4"> Senator Pete Domenici from New Mexico, member of the Senate for three decades and a candidate in the 2008 elections, is the third influential Republican official in ten days to publicly oppose the policy of increasing the number of US troops in Iraq adopted by the American president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In a press conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico the day before yesterday, he said "I do not support continuing with our current strategy", blaming the Iraqi government for failing to make enough progress to merit the sacrifices made by American troops.</seg>
<seg id="6"> According to the French press agency he said "I don't support an immediate withdrawal from Iraq or a reduction in funding for our troops".</seg>
<seg id="7"> But he added: "I do support a new strategy that will move our troops out of combat operations and on to the path to come home."</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said: "The Iraqi government has failed to make even modest progress to help Iraq itself or to merit the sacrifices being made by our men and women in uniform."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The senator said he would support a bill presented to the Senate calling for the implementation of the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which was published last year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Group recommended adopting a policy aimed at withdrawing the majority of American combat troops from Iraq by March 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Furthermore, it added that some US troops have to remain in Iraq to train the new Iraqi army, protect American facilities and carry out counter-terrorism missions.</seg>
<seg id="12"> On Tuesday, Bush said that the strategy focusing on sending 30,000 extra troops into Iraq, now reaching its peak, should be given a chance to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="13"> He said "If we were to quit Iraq before the job is done, the terrorists we are fighting would not declare victory and lay down their arms."</seg>
<seg id="14"> Bush added "They would follow us here, to our homes.</seg>
<seg id="15"> However difficult the fight is in Iraq, we must win it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Last week, influential Republican senator Richard Lugar caused a stir in political circles in Washington when he told the Senate that the policy of sending reinforcements had no chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Republican George Voinovich also recommended a withdrawal from Iraq.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Domenici's statements come days before the return of Congress members to Washington after a week of recess, and with the Democrats, who hold a majority in both Houses, preparing to launch a new attack on Bush's policy in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Senior Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate have commented on Domenici's statements.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House of Representatives, said the question was whether Republicans opposing Bush would "join in voting to change the course in Iraq and to bring the troops home"?</seg>
<seg id="21"> She added, "How long until you respect the wishes of the American people to end this war?"</seg>
<seg id="22"> The leader of the Democrat majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, said, "Domenici is correct to assess the Administration's war strategy as being misguided."</seg>
<seg id="23"> He added, "But we will not see a much-needed change of course in Iraq until Republicans like Senators Domenici, Lugar and Voinovich are willing to stand up to President Bush and his stubborn adherence to a failing policy."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Bush Envoy to Sudan Arrives in Khartoum to Speed Up the Peace Process in Darfur; Talks in Security Council on the Implementation of the Resolution on the Deployment of Forces in the Region</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Andrew Natsios, the envoy of the American President to Sudan, began his field visit yesterday with a tour of the troubled Darfur region. The visit of the American envoy, his second since his appointment to the post early this year, comes only days after the Sudanese president Omar Al-Bashir personally attacked him, accusing him of hampering the peace process in Darfur, and of "inciting rebels in the region against the peace efforts, one day after the visit of two envoys from the African Union and the United Nations on the status of the road map to resume peace negotiations between the Sudanese government and the Darfur armed movements who reject the fragile Abuja agreement."</seg>
<seg id="3"> Informed sources in Khartoum said that the 7-day visit of the envoy of the US President to Sudan aims to appraise the developments and the progress of the implementation of the comprehensive peace process in the South and the Abuja peace agreement in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It will include Natsios holding negotiations with several officials in the country, mainly the First Vice President Salva Kiir Mayardit, the Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha, the Senior Presidential Aide Minni Arku Menawi, and the Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. Lam Akol Ajawin..</seg>
<seg id="5"> He is then to visit Southern Sudan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Meanwhile, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad, Permanent Representative of Sudan to the United Nations, said that there were closed talks between permanent member states of the Security Council, on some potential elements of the draft resolution on the hybrid operation in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He expected this week's talks to include experts as well as the remaining members of the Security Council, after which a date would be set for a Security Council session in which the proposal would be officially discussed and the hybrid operation would be authorized.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abdalhaleem said that the current month of July and the coming month of August were significant in terms of the development of the Darfur issue, in that it is expected that the Security Council will issue a resolution to authorize and fund the hybrid operation and will also raise the manner of reaching a peaceful solution to the issue. He referred to the current visit to the country by Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim, peace envoys to Sudan from the United Nations and the African Union respectively which will be followed up by a conference to be held in Tripoli in the middle of this month on Darfur until August when political negotiations will begin with the Abuja rejecters, according to what has been decided in the road map.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He also said that the previous agreement has now begun to be implemented, with the arrival of the new head of the African forces and the AU-UN joint envoy in Khartoum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> One delegate stated that the Sudanese mission in New York was taking part in the talks to ensure that the draft hybrid operation was in line with the previously approved basic conditions and reference points.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Abdalmahmood said that the Security Council would hold a session next Thursday to listen to the report on its members' visit to a number of African countries, including Sudan.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Hong Kong Disneyland Attracts More Chinese Tourists</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With the tenth anniversary of the end of British rule in Hong Kong and this island's return to China after 150 years, the Hong Kong Disneyland amusement park, which is suffering low returns, yesterday, Tuesday, opened a promotional exhibition in Guangzhou in Southern China in an attempt to attract more Chinese visitors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This may be an economically crucial step, particularly with China economically opening up to the world and adopting a market policy which has so far been responsible for the increase in wealthy individuals, whose numbers are on a par with those in the Western world.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This exhibition, organized by the 3-billion dollar investment theme park,  uses a variety of media to present the various entertainment elements in the park, and samples of what it contains. It is the first of its kind in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5"> As part of its promotional campaign, Hong Kong Disneyland has, according to the German News Agency, distributed 270 DVDs all over China to persuade more Chinese people, particularly in the southern provinces, to visit Hong Kong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to some reports, more than 100 million Chinese people have sufficient financial means to enable them to travel abroad, which means that Hong Kong will not be the only country to benefit from this tourist flux.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Hong Kong Disneyland opened its doors to the public in September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The number of visitors has not been publicized since the admission that the target number of visitors of 5.6 million visitors in the first year had not been achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Moroccan King Supports Sarkozy's Mediterranean Project, in a Congratulatory Message on the Occasion of France's National Day.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> King Mohammed VI of Morocco renewed his support for French President Nicolas Sarkozy's project which calls for the creation of a union for Mediterranean basin states.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In his message to Sarkozy on the occasion of the French national day on July 14, King Mohammed VI, described the Mediterranean project as creative, as it would meet the aspirations of the peoples of the region, and would meet the real challenges facing it, as stated in the royal message.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The king of Morocco praised the "ambitious" reforms doggedly and resolutely undertaken by the new French President, as what he described as their initiative and clear vision aimed at continuing the influential role of France and bolstering its international standing.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Moroccan king expressed his delight at the forthcoming visit by Sarkozy, planned for next October, saying, "This will be another opportunity for us to celebrate the French-Moroccan friendship and to deepen our cooperation to support the values of peace, democracy, dialog and understanding between cultures."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Sarkozy's first visit to North Africa was supposed to include Morocco, but in the end he decided to only visit Algeria and Tunisia, as Morocco requested the postponement of Sarkozy's visit due to the busy agenda of the Moroccan king, who was in Medina and Jeddah (East) on the day of Sarkozy's visit to Algeria.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Rabat justified the postponement by saying that it wanted Sarkozy's official visit to Morocco to be a State visit which would last for as long as possible, allowing for extensive talks and discussions dealing with bilateral relations as well as regional and international issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The French presidency seems to have accepted the Moroccan justifications, and was quick to deny that there were any transient problems affecting relations between Rabat and Paris, saying that the French President had affirmed that he would return to North Africa for a longer visit, and that his short visit to Algeria and Tunisia was dictated by other commitments awaiting him in his country, to prepare for the forthcoming political season, as well as commitments on the European front.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Difficulties Facing the Implementation of the "Deal on Wanted Activists"... Israel Denies an Imminent Withdrawal from Palestinian Towns.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The efforts of the Palestinian authority aimed at closing the dossier of wanted activists linked to the Al-Aqsa Brigades, the armed wing of the Fatah movement, encountered difficulties after Israel's refusal to stop pursuing 206 wanted activists whom the Authority asked to be included in the Israeli amnesty decision.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Israel justified its refusal by claiming that some wanted activists from the first list had not handed over their weapons to the security apparatus or had not signed a pledge to stop attacks on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Official security sources told Al-Sharq Al-Awsat that Israel refused in principle to stop pursuing 28 wanted Brigades members in the West Bank, most of whom are in Nablus and Jenin, as they are suspected of being linked to the Lebanese Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronoth reported that Yuval Diskin, the Head of Shabak, the Israel security agency, met the Palestinian Minister of the Interior Abdul-Razzaq Al-Yahya and other security officials in Ramallah more than once to seek an acceptable solution for these wanted activists.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Meanwhile, security sources confirmed this news to Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, but refused to go into detail.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, informed sources from the Al-Aqsa Brigades told Al-Sharq Al-Awsat that Israel had proposed to expel the 28 wanted activists from the Palestinian Territories, or to round them up in Ramallah or Jericho, but the Authority had rejected the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Last Wednesday, apparently as a result of the current crisis Israel did not hand the Authority a list which was to include the names of around 120 wanted Brigade members.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A controversy has broken out among the Al-Aqsa Brigades on the decision to halt attacks on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The decision to stop the attacks, announced by Zakaria al-Zubaidi, the Al-Aqsa Brigade commander in Jenin, was rejected by leading figures in the Al-Aqsa Brigades, who told Al-Sharq Al-Awsat that it was not binding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a related development, Miri Eisen, a spokeswoman for the Israeli government, has denied news quoting Palestinian officials and reported by newspapers and news agencies about Israel's imminent withdrawal from Qalqilya and Jericho.</seg>
<seg id="12"> She said, "Not everything the Palestinians demand can be fulfilled."</seg>
<seg id="13"> The website of Yediot Ahronoth had recently quoted a Palestinian official as saying that the Authority was discussing with the Israelis a plan to transfer the authority of Palestinian towns over three stages, starting with Qalqilya and Jericho, followed by Ramallah and Bethlehem, and ending with Tulkarem. According to the source Nablus and Jenin were excluded.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The Israeli army has meanwhile expanded its operations in the West Bank and last night arrested more than 25 Palestinians from various towns in the West Bank. This comes ahead of the expected release of 256 Palestinian prisoners tomorrow morning at 9 am, who will be taken to the Betuniya checkpoint near Ramallah, according to the Directorate of Israeli Prisons which announced that it was awaiting the approval of the Supreme Court of Justice, following the submission of petitions demanding that no Palestinian prisoners be released. The Israeli State Prosecutor had informed the Court that the decision was a political one, which the Courts have no authority over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will welcome the released prisoners by the grave of the late president Yasser Arafat in the presidential headquarters in Ramallah.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Geneva - AFP: The United Nations High Commission for Refugees expressed its regret that Turkey had deported 135 Iraqis and sent them back to their country, and warned that this step constitutes a clear violation of international law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In a statement published in Geneva the day before yesterday, the agency expressed its "deep concern at reports that the Turkish authorities forcibly returned 135 Iraqis to their home country earlier this week".</seg>
<seg id="4"> The UNHCR demanded urgent clarifications from the Turkish government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Given the current situation in Iraq, the UNHCR is extremely concerned for the safety of these people", the agency said, adding that no information is currently available on their whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The statement said that 135 people were apprehended near Izmir in western Turkey earlier this month, and were part of a group of some 500 people - most of them Iraqis, Palestinians, Sri Lankans and Afghans, who were about to secretly leave Turkey .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The UNHCR said that some of the Iraqis had applied for asylum in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It added, "If this is confirmed, the deportations would be a clear violation of the principle of non-refoulement, under which no refugee or asylum seeker can be forcibly returned to a country where their life or liberty may be at risk."</seg>

<seg id="2"> Kabul - Reuters: A Taliban spokesman yesterday said that movement leaders set 0730GMT on Monday as a final deadline for the Korean hostages. He said the movement would start killing the hostages if their prisoners are not released by that time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf said the deadline had been set by the Taliban leadership, headed by movement leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, giving the threat added weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The kidnappers killed the leader of the Korean group on Wednesday, but several further deadlines have passed without the rebels carrying out their threat to kill the remaining hostages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Since the talks between us, the Kabul administration and the Korean government have reached deadlock and they are not honest ... we will start killing the hostages if they do not start releasing our prisoners by tomorrow at 12 o'clock," Yousuf told Reuters by telephone from an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Sporadic talks between the Afghan government and Korean diplomats on one side and Taliban rebels on the other have continually snagged over the rebel demand for Kabul to swap prisoners for the Korean hostages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Afghan President Hamid Karzai has previously ruled out any deal with the Taliban after coming under harsh criticism for freeing five Taliban prisoners in exchange for the release of an Italian hostage in March.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In his first comments on the latest hostage case, Karzai condemned the kidnapping, but did not say whether any deal might be possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "Hostage-taking and the abuse of foreign guests, especially women, is against Islam and Afghan culture and the perpetration of this heinous act on our soil is in total contempt of our Islamic and Afghan values," a spokesman quoted him as saying.</seg>
<seg id="10"> An Afghan minister said on Saturday force might be used if talks fail.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Vatican described the kidnapping a "grave violation of human dignity that clashes with every elementary norm of civility and rights and gravely offends divine law".</seg>
<seg id="12"> Eighteen of the remaining hostages are women.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yousuf said some of the captives who are being held in small groups at different locations were sick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Ghazni's governor, Mirajuddin Pathan, said medicines the Korean government had wanted to send could not be delivered on Saturday because the Afghan team could not establish contact with the Taliban.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> He said the government did not want to use force to rescue the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="16"> "We have no plan to attack," he told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="17"> "We are trying to send the delegation for more talks."</seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to Afghan forces, foreign troops are also stationed in Ghazni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> South Korean special envoy Baek Jong-chun met Karzai yesterday to discuss ways of ending the hostage crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The Taliban are also still holding one German and four of his Afghan colleagues, abducted from a neighboring province a day before the Koreans.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Another German seized alongside them was later found dead with gunshot wounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The South Koreans are the largest group of foreigners who have been abducted by the Taliban since U.S.-led forces and Afghan forces overthrew their governnment in 2001.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It comes amid an increase of violence in the past 18 months, the bloodiest period since the Taliban's removal.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="4"> The London conference was hosted by Mr Sharif and also featured opposition leaders Imran Khan, Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman, Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Amin Fahim, vice-chairman of the Pakistan People's Party.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Pakistan People's Party leader Benazir Bhutto did not attend, despite being invited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> 38 parties in total were represented at the conference, of which all but one, the Pakistan People's Party, agreed to have all of their MPs resign if Musharraf followed through with plans to get himself re-elected by parliament before polls due at the end of this year or early next year, as Nadir Chaudri, Nawaz Sharif's spokesman, told the France Press Agency,</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Pakistan People's Party decided to reserve its decision.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Dubai 7/11/2007 (AFP) - The leader of "Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb" criticized efforts to develop relations between Algeria and France on Tuesday, and called upon France to "confess to all the crimes it has committed against Muslims in Algeria".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a statement published today on the Internet, the leader of the organization, Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, particularly condemned current efforts to sign a friendship treaty between France and its former colony Algeria, as he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the statement, which coincided with the visit of Nicolas Sarkozy to Algeria on Tuesday, "There is still a wall of skulls and dead bodies and a sea of tears and blood separating France and Muslims", and "the real Islam rejects the term friendship with unbelievers", as he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Algeria was occupied by France from 1830 until it gained independence in 1962 after a liberation war which claimed the lives of more than one million martyrs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Abu Musab Abdul Wadud continued in his statement, "the history of France in Algeria, since 1830 to this day, has been full of crimes, repression, hegemony, tyranny, murders, exile and displacement. There is almost no justification in a history spanning two full centuries for having ties, even superficial ones, with France, in addition to their being no justification for friendship with her".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Sarkozy declared that he would return to Algeria in November for a state visit prepared by both countries, which will produce "tangible results".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The conclusion of the friendship treaty between the two countries had stumbled over France's refusal to assent to Algeria's demand that it acknowledge its colonial "crimes".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The French President has repeatedly asserted that he rejects the idea of his country apologizing for its colonial past and of its people bearing the guilt for their forefathers' practices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Abdul Wadud demanded that France in particular "acknowledge all the crimes it committed against Muslims in Algeria, since acknowledgement is known to be the first step towards conciliation, referring to how Germany acknowledged "what it had done to the Jews".</seg>
<seg id="11"> "Why should France not acknowledge as Germany has done?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He concluded the statement by saying, in a threatening tone, "If Sarkozy continues with his old ignorance and still insists on saying that sons cannot apologize for the actions of their fathers, he will have to expect that sons in Algeria will not keep silent about what happened to their fathers"..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He also demanded that France stop interfering in Algeria's internal affairs and withdraw its forces from Afghanistan and Lebanon.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Israel Allowed Arms Transfer to the Palestinian Authority (Haaretz)</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem 7/26/2007 (AFP) -  Israel recently authorized the transfer of weapons from Jordan to the Palestinian Authority, the deputy Israeli defense minister Matan Vilnai said on Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Vilnai told Israel's Channel 10 television: "We permitted the transfer of arms, and while we are not sure that they will not end up in Hamas's hands, we want to prevent them from taking power in the West Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "We hope that forces loyal to Abu Mazen will, as a result, be able to oppose Hamas. We are not confident but are doing what we can", he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Wednesday, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert referred to the arms transfer operation, talking of "different, more confidential initiatives" as part of the measures taken by his government to support Mahmoud Abbas' position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On Thursday, the Haaretz newspaper reported that the government had authorised the shipment of 1,000 M-16 assault rifles from Jordan to the Palestinian Authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The paper said it would be the largest such amount of arms ever to be transferred to the Palestinian security forces with Israel's approval.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Haaretz said that since the beginning of this year, several thousand rifles have been delivered from Egypt and Jordan to Fatah forces with Israel's approval.</seg>
<seg id="9"> But most of these weapons have fallen into the hands of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</seg>

<seg id="1"> General Petraeus: British Not Planning Withdrawal from Iraq</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Wasington 7/3/2007 (AFP) - General David Petraeus, the commander of US forces in Iraq, said on Monday that he does "not believe" the British are currently planning to pull their troops out of Iraq in an interview with the American TV network "ABC News".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> While British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is in talks with the US President George Bush at Camp David (Maryland, east), newspaper reports have spoken of a withdrawal plan for the 5,500 British troops in Iraq. However, Brown's spokesman has denied this news.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> From Baghdad, General Petraeus, said: "I don't believe there is a plan".</seg>
<seg id="5"> "There is a plan for a gradual withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="6"> "In fact, they have in recent months transferred some facilities in Basra (south) to the Iraqi security forces, and they intend to do continue doing that in the months ahead."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He confirmed that US forces would remain in Iraq until the summer of 2009, to be able to establish lasting security in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Without setting a date for the withdrawal of the 160,000 US troops in Iraq, General Petraeus said it would "take almost that long", although it was more important to identify "the number of troops needed".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In response to a question about the arms contracts worth $20 billion with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and five other Gulf countries, and the possible presence of Saudi fighters in Iraq, the American general said: "I'm not actually sure that they're coming from Saudi."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He added, "We know that they are Saudi citizens and citizens from North Africa and from the region who are coming through Syria."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheney: Increase of US Troops in Iraq Is Yielding Results</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Washington 8/1/2007 (AFP) - US Vice-President Dick Cheney announced on Tuesday that the strategy of sending troop reinforcements to Iraq has improved security there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In response to a question by the American channel CNN, Cheney defended the Iraqi deputies' decision to take a month off, saying "It's better than taking two months off, which was their original plan," adding that the US was "eager" to see them complete their work."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Last month, an initial report submitted to the White House on the impact of the new strategy confirmed that the progress achieved by the Iraqi parliament was not enough to implement necessary reforms, particularly the ratification of the law to share oil revenues, which increased the tension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the US Vice-President said he believed the report expected in September on the impact of the new strategy would reveal "significant progress" in the achievement of the targets set by the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> With regard to the the report compiled by General David Petraeus and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker, Cheney said he believes it will "show real progress".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "The reports I'm hearing from people whose views I respect indicate that, indeed, the Petraeus plan is in fact producing results," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> After reiterating that the decision to invade Iraq in March 2003 was correct, Cheney concluded by saying: "We (President George Bush and himself) will walk out of here on January 20 2009 and I think we'll be able to hold our heads high knowing we did the best we could for our country."</seg>

<seg id="2"> The Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb killed 7 security and police officers in a terrorist attack on two security vehicles in the Algerian province of Tizi Ouzou during a wide-scale search for Al-Qaeda hideouts in several eastern Algerian towns and provinces.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Al-Qaeda organization released a videotape filmed last night showing the clashes with the Algerian security forces in a Tizi Ouzu mountain, leading up to the terrorist explosion operation killing seven officers and the burning of security vehicles in a terrorist blast through a bomb planted on the roadside as the security motorcade was passing intermittently.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The tape showed several members of the terrorist groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda pursuing security officials as they escaped from the cars at the moment of the blast, as well as scenes from the clashes between both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the same tape, the leader of the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb, Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, threatened to carry out a series of terrorist attacks against Algerian interests and institutions at several locations in Algeria, saying that this would come as part of Al-Qaeda's plan to expand its operations in the coming period.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The leader of the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb has further threatened to target American and European interests in North Africa and to counter, through violence and terrorism, American efforts to establish the headquarters of the US military command known as AFRICOM in the North Africa and West Africa region.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Abu Musab Abdul Wadud called on Algerian youth to refuse to join the security forces and the army in the coming period, so as not to come to any harm during Al-Qaeda's operations against the security forces.</seg>

<seg id="1"> British Foreign Secretary: the United States Is Still Britain's Number One Ally</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> London - News agencies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In an article published in the tabloid "News of the World" yesterday, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, emphasized the strong relationship between his country and the United States, denying that there has been a slight change in relations between London and Washington since Prime Minister Gordon Brown has come to office. Miliband insisted that the US is still Britain's number one ally.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "With the new Brown government, some people are looking for evidence that our alliance is breaking up", Miliband wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5"> "There isn't any and there won't be any," he added. "Nothing has changed".</seg>
<seg id="6"> He said that, compared with other bilateral relationships, "our strongest bilateral relationship is with the USA. We are stronger together than apart. Our shared values give us real strength."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Miliband further spoke of shared sacrifice in other struggles, such as climate change, poverty in African and terrorism. These are challenges that cannot be faced without the United States, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last Thursday in Washington, the new Secretary of Trade and International Development, Douglas Alexander, spoke of the benefits of a policy built on multilateralism, thus explaining the slight change in British foreign policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Meanwhile, a survey published in the British Daily Telegraph newspaper showed that after only two weeks of Gordon Brown coming into office, the Labour Party has overtaken the opposition Conservatives, with 40% of the British supporting the Labour Party compared to 33% supporting the Conservatives.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Every Day: by Morsi Atallah</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> If the Al-Qaeda organization, which has claimed responsibility for most of the terrorist operations in the world, is fighting Israel, according to its media discourse, why hasn't Al-Qaeda carried out a single terrorist attack against Israel?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The question may seem strange, but it is in my opinion valid and logical. If Al-Qaeda justifies its terrorist activities against Arab and Islamic countries with the fact that they deal with Israel and have engaged in peace processes with the Hebrew state, why doesn't Al Qaeda cut to the chase and attack Israel, since that is its enemy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although some of the people who pose this question try to insinuate that this constitutes proof of Israel's involvement in these operations, nobody has been able to come up with any irrefutable evidence for that. As a result, these insinuations remain nothing but suspicions, not to be elevated to the status of direct accusations against Israel, although some of these insinuations don't exclude the possibility that Al-Qaeda works as an underground agent, with or without being aware of that!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In fact, whoever examines the articles and investigations published in Israel's major newspapers will clearly see that Israeli sources close to power circles in Israel categorically and confidently assert that "Israel is not one of Al-Qaeda's targets". This raises a lot of questions about the reasons behind Israelis' confidence that Al-Qaeda will not target them!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Although these Israeli sources have tried to cover this up by saying that the Al-Qaeda organization's target is the Christian world, this cunning statement doesn't only aim to divert suspicions from Israel, but also to drive a wedge between Islam and Christianity by means of a false lie propagated by Western media close to Israel, which pictures Al-Qaeda as one of flagships of the Arab-Islamic world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One unquestionable fact is that the violence carried out by Israel and the gross injustice which falls upon Palestinians by means of its aggressive policies constitute the ideal environment for Al-Qaeda to work freely and to be able to recruit new generations of extremists which have suffered injustice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In return, by carrying out terrorist acts, the Al-Qaeda organization does Israel a great service, since resistance becomes linked to terrorism on one hand, and all forms of aggression and excessive use of force become justified under the pretense of the right of self-defense on the other hand!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In all honesty, and without beating round the bush, those who are hindering the organization of an international counter-terrorism conference are not far from all the questions and suspicions circulating overtly or covertly, which are, until now, without irrefutable evidence. However, in the future, and in the context of new international conditions and balances which do not allow double standards, these suspicions may become lengthy petitions full of incriminating evidence, awaiting a righteous judge who will put an end to this hateful phenomenon called terrorism.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When the State lies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The commotion that has surrounded the sale of the Banque du Caire has not subsided yet, even after the Governor of the Central Bank admitted that the bank has reached a perilous stage where action needs to be taken, and which has negatively affected its performance, in a way that the bank is no longer able to pay any more bills in order to solve its problems.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The state budget - which is already in severe deficit - was unable to provide 20 billion pounds to settle its debts and to make up for its budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The government subsequently offered 80% of the Bank du Caire for sale to a main investor, after it realized - belatedly - that the idea of merger and acquisition would not be a successful remedy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> This, quite simply, is the image that has reached the vast majority of the non-economist public like me, following a huge debate on this issue between those who understand and those who don't, between those who defend the government in right and wrong and those who criticize it on the basis of sound political and economic arguments, such as the argument that the sale of Egyptian banks to foreign investors constitutes a danger to the national economy and opens the doors to foreign control of the finance of development projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Regardless of how sound the arguments on both sides are, the government usually does what it wants, and it will go ahead with the sale of the bank according to a plan for the so-called "bank sector reform", in compliance with agreements with international organizations, (the details of which are locked away in the drawers of the Policies Committee, to deny public access to them), which take precedence over its compliance with the rules of transparency it talks about!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But the real problem, in my opinion, is not the conditions that have made the sale of Banque du Caire necessary, but in the government's inspectorial culture  which relies on concealing facts and weaknesses and people burying their heads in the sand, until everything bursts out at once. It has transpired that the problems facing Banque du Caire are not at all new, but that they began six years ago, and that successive governments have not bothered to make them public or to deal with them. This raises questions about the political and legal responsibility of several former ministers and prime ministers, as during their time in office the bank's vaults were opened up to a number of businessmen, who were then allowed to take out as many unsecured loans as they wanted, and to leave the country with them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This, I believe, is one of the main reasons for the difficulties facing Banque du Caire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Egyptian political system does not recognize the principle of the political accountability of officials.</seg>
<seg id="11"> They are not punished for crimes of negligence, favoritism and misuse of public funds.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Things happening in the banking sector, driving one of Egypt's main banks to the verge of bankruptcy, can also be found, one way or another, in other sectors.</seg>
<seg id="13"> For example, the sudden decline in water, the collapse of the railway system and the marine transportation system and others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All these are a result of the reluctance to deal with problems and the habit of concealing them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The responsibility for these miserable conditions of the state apparatus doesn't lie with civil servants who lie with the knowledge of their bosses.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The whole state lies and falsifies figures and data, and this happens due to the absence of accountability and transparency at all levels, despite the numerous control and auditing organizations.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Egypt is currently intensifying its necessary contacts with the International Quartet and all international parties in order to deal with the current Palestinian situation in the light of successive developments and events, including visits by the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers to Israel last Wednesday in connection with the Arab peace initiative, as well as the ministerial meeting held by the Arab League, and the visit by the US Secretary of State to Egypt at the end of this month.</seg>
<seg id="4"> A diplomatic source stated that Egypt is continuing to give absolute priority to the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, which it considered an emergency that can't be put off, and that it was working towards improving the quality of life of Palestinians and improving economic conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Javier Solana, EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, met with Abul-Gheit to discuss the main outcomes of his and his Jordanian counterpart's visit to Israel in an effort to garner support for the Arab peace initiative. The diplomatic source said that the Foreign Minister was currently preparing a report with the Jordanian Foreign Minister to submit to the Arab League at the ministerial meeting on Monday, to include the main conclusions drawn from the visit, in accordance with the outcome of the meeting of the Arab initiative's ministerial committee on April 18.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Abul-Gheit told Al Ahram that the international parties, and the International Quartet in particular, would be briefed about the main results of the visit and the reaction of the Israeli side to the initiative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Abul Gheit pointed out that there were ongoing talks with the International Quartet on the suggestions made by US President George Bush in his last speech on the conditions of the Palestinians, and in particular the suggestion to hold an international meeting between all parties concerned. He asserted that the Egyptian position was that it was not enough to carry out work to improve the quality of life of Palestinians and to support their institutions, but that these had to be accompanied by serious political negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Foreign Minister said that Egypt assured all parties that the conditions were right to restart negotiations, and urged them to contribute by giving the much-needed push for a positive move, while Israel should continue taking positive long-term steps which Palestinian citizens can feel.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Minister of Petroleum Engineer Sameh Fahmi visited some new oil fields in the Western desert as well as the new production facilities in the area and the Al-Hamra specialized oil port, which is considered one of the most important and strategic sites for crude oil shipment and export. It is a primary gathering point for the crude oil produced in the Western desert, where around 185,000 barrels are produced daily, expected to rise to 225,000 barrels in the coming period.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Minister said that the Al Hamra port had all the important factors to be a major export hub through a well-developed system. He ordered the preparation of a study aimed at the development of the Al Hamra oil port's facilities and the pipelines linked to it in order to increase its current export capacity from 600 thousand barrels to one million barrels monthly, as well as its storage capacity from 800 thousand barrels to one million barrels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> During the visit, Engineer Shamel Hamdy, Head of the Western Desert Development Committee, reviewed a report about production development in the Western Desert region and the status of production after putting several newly discovered fields on stream successively. This will lead to an increase in production in the Western Desert region to about 40 thousand barrels daily, which means that the total production in the region will reach about 270 thousand barrels per day by next April.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The visit also covered the pipelines for incoming crude oil in the port, which includes three main pipelines, as well as the crude oil transfer and shipment facilities via land pipelines, and the storage depots and shipping terminal pumps.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Minister also visited the integrated support office for combating maritime oil pollution, which is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment for combating maritime pollution. He also visited the port's chemical lab which specializes in crude oil quality control and is fitted with state-of-the-art technological equipment as well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Minister of Petroleum had an open meeting with workers from the various oil companies working in Al-Hamra port, namely Badruddin, Gabco, Webco, Ageeba, Al-Hamra,  Anabib Al-Petrol, Khalida, Ganub Al-Dabaa and Al-Alamain. He listened to their ideas and suggestions for developing performance in order to implement the planned schedules for the increase in production.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He asked the workers to give their best efforts and demanded that the best types of care are given to those working in the fields, in proportion to the efforts they make.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated his intention to remain in office, after the crushing defeat suffered by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party headed by him in upper house polls two days ago. He said he would take the results very seriously and vowed to continue pushing for reforms to build the nation and encourage economic development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> It should be noted that defeat in the upper house will not oust Abe's coalition from power, as he still maintains a large majority in the stronger lower house which chooses the Prime Minister. In a bid to regain voters' confidence, Abe said a Cabinet reshuffle would take place.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He added that people were demanding a comprehensive change as well as a change in the party's ledership. Abe faces pressure to resign from inside his Liberal Democratic Party which has ruled Japan for most of the past 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Japanese Yomiuri newspaper quoted the former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba as saying that Prime Minister Abe should quit, otherwise, the party will be finished soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But analysts said that the current absence of a suitable successor in the party would help Abe remain in power for some time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun wrote that Abe should quickly dissolve the lower house and listen to the people. But Abe has ruled out the possibility of dissolving the lower house or of carrying out early legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Despite Mr Abe's refusal to step down, the deputy leader of his party has decided to resign over the party's heavy defeat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the New Komeito Party, won 46 seats in the lower house elections, while the Democratic Party, the main opposition party, won 60 seats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The ruling coalition needed 64 seats to retain its majority in the upper house, as half of the 242 seats in the upper house were up for election.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Abe's party won 37 seats, which constitutes a defeat worse than that suffered in 1998, which forced Ryutaro Hashimoto to resign from office as the head of government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Angry voters denied Abe's government a majority after a series of scandals and the government's inability to deal with the problem of pension records.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nuclearly, Husseini reported that his country is considering the "timeout" suggestion, which entails halting the expansion of its uranium enrichment program in return for suspending efforts to impose more sanctions on the country by the United Nations. But he stressed that "halting enrichment is not an option;" whereas a diplomat in Vienna has said that global powers are discussing means to introduce the idea to Iran in order to end the nuclear crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed El Baradei had put forward the idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Husseini also said, "There is nothing new in this proposal; it has been discussed before,</seg>
<seg id="16"> but Iran is still examining it," adding that "Tehran is willing to study any plans and suggestions that would guarantee its rights in the negotiation process."</seg>
<seg id="17"> He added that Iran's chief negotiator Ali Larijani and the European High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana discussed the proposal during talks concerning the nuclear dispute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> However, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and national security, stated that the idea of  a "timeout" is also not an appropriate solution.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Yemen: the Suicide Bomber of the Queen of Sheba Temple... Was an Arab.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said yesterday that the initial investigation into the suicide attack that targeted a convoy of Spanish tourists in the governorate of Marib on Monday, killing seven tourists and two Yemeni drivers and injuring others, indicated that the perpetrator of the attack was not Yemeni but was an Arab national.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He promised to reveal the details very soon, after examining the suicide attacker's DNA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Initial accusations against the Al-Qaeda organization in Yemen of being responsible for the attack, indicated the possibility that the perpetrator of the attack on the Queen of Sheba temple may have been Yemeni, and may have been one of the 23 who escaped the prison of the Political Security Organization (Intelligence service) last year after Al-Qaeda announced the appointment of one of them, Nasser Al-Wehaishi (Abu Baseer), as their new leader, and circulated a recording with the voice of Kassem Al-Raimi (Abu Huraira), who is on the list of wanted fugitives, in which he threatened to carry out attacks he described as "Jihadism against crusaders and their associates in Yemen".</seg>
<seg id="7"> "Abu Huraira" denied any negotiations with the Yemeni government, and stated that he was commissioned by "Abu Baseer" to make the recorded announcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Yemeni president described the attack on tourists in Marib as "criminal and terrorist, cowardly and dirty", threatening all Al-Qaeda operatives with the most severe punishment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said, "We will track them down wherever they may be and wherever they may go or hide, and we will punish them sternly for the crimes they have committed against innocent tourists and their Yemeni escorts, and against the nation and its interests, security, and stability."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Ali Saleh announced a 15 Million-Riyal-reward (75 thousand US dollars) to anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest of the terrorist elements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Upon the arrival of a Spanish plane, carrying the Spanish tourism minister and the families of the victims to Sanaa to transport the bodies of the Spanish victims back to their country, the investigation authorities began examining the suicide attacker's DNA in order to determine his identity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The attack was carried out by a suicide attacker in a 1992 model "Toyota Jeep".</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yemeni authorities have taken further strict security measures at embassies, hotels, and foreign facilities throughout the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Certain Yemeni government circles have considered the suicide attack to be a painful blow to the tourism industry, after information about European and foreign tourism agencies canceling thousands of reservations made by tourists including tourist visits this summer.</seg>
<seg id="15"> They said that the Yemeni economy "will be negatively impacted and will lose substantial tourism revenues."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In addition, the Yemeni House of Representatives launched a fierce criticism of the government and accused security bodies of negligence and of disregarding recent threats by Al-Qaeda members to carry out imminent and severe "terrorist" attacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The House of Representatives, which issued a statement condemning the attack and rejecting any link between the "terrorist" elements and the Islamic religion, summoned Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Dr Rashad Al-Alimi to stand before the deputies next Sunday and answer their questions concerning negligence.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Thousands of Palestinians Remain Stuck at the Border with Egypt...</seg>
<seg id="2"> The Ousted Palestinian Government and Several Factions Refuse to Open the Karam Abu Salem Crossing in Place of the Rafah Crossing.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Palestinian voices rose in protest to let in a few thousand Palestinians stuck in Egypt into the Gaza Strip through the Karam Abu Salem crossing or what Israel calls "Kerem Shalom", located at the intersection point of the Palestinian Egyptian-Israeli border to the southeast of the city of Rafah in the far south of the Strip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The national unity government and a number of resistance factions expressed their absolute refusal to replace the Rafah border crossing as a passage for Palestinians throughout the world with the "Kerem Shalom" crossing.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The factions translated their refusal into action through the firing of mortar shells and missiles over the crossing, which was originally allocated to bring in goods and not for the transportation of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> All this transpired after talk of an Egyptian-Israeli agreement to open the crossing of "Kerem Shalom" on Wednesday for one day with the purpose of bringing in some 4 thousand Palestinians stuck in Egyptian cities such as Rafah, Arish, and Cairo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Those Palestinians, 600 of which have fallen sick, have lost all hope because of the refusal of the Israeli occupation forces to open the Rafah crossing for almost a month to allow the Palestinians to return to or depart from the Strip freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Israel had allowed the opening of the crossing for two successive days, the sixth and 7th of last month. Since then it has refused to reopen it, especially after Hamas tightened its grip over the Gaza Strip through the use of force, on the 14th of last month.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Israel permanently closed the Rafah border crossing for the first time in the wake of the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in a commando operation conducted by militants belonging to the "Hamas" movement, the Popular Resistance Committees, and the "Army of Islam" at an Israeli military site near "Kerem Shalom" on June 25 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Since then, Israel has permitted the opening of the Rafah crossing on an average of four to six days a month, spread over its four weeks. In other instances, the closure has continued uninterrupted for a month or more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The government, in a statement issued yesterday, demanded the reopening of the Rafah crossing to the movement of travelers "so as not to turn the Gaza Strip into a huge prison".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The government also expressed its firm rejection of "all Israeli attempts to move the Rafah border crossing (...) to the Karam Abu Salem area, keeping the Egyptian-Palestinian border free of any foreign intervention or custodianship".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The "Hamas" movement, the "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine", the "Islamic Jihad" movement, the Popular Resistance Committees, and the Martyr Ahmed Abu Al-Rish Brigades have joined the government in its refusal to let stranded Palestinians enter via the Kerem Shalom crossing, and demanded that the Rafah border crossing be allowed to function again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Many activists, tens of whom are injured, fear returning through the "Kerem Shalom" crossing, which is entirely controlled by Israel, in fear of being arrested by occupation soldiers, who are in control of all the operational details at the crossing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Israel constructed the "Kerem Shalom" crossing under a Gaza Strip border-crossing protocol known as the "Rice Agreement", an agreement which was reached on November 15 2005, following Israeli withdrawal from the Strip on September 12 of the same year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The protocol states that the Rafah crossing is to be designated for the movement of Palestinians, diplomats, and others, as well as for exporting goods from the Strip, under Palestinian-Egyptian command and the supervision of the European monitoring mission.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It also states that goods should enter through the "Kerem Shalom" crossing for the some 1.5 million Palestinians living on a coastal strip with an area of less than 365 square kilometers.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Nechirvan Barzani, the head of the government of the Kurdistan Region, has admitted that there have been cases where the rights of detainees in Kurdish prisons have been violated. Meanwhile, the Islamic Group in Kurdistan has defied orders from the region's government not to hold meetings in Jamjamal mosque.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> He stated at a press conference, "I cannot say whether what is contained in the Human Rights Watch report is correct or incorrect. In fact, there are violations, and we in the government of the Kurdistan region have implemented considerable reforms in prisons, and we have cooperated and opened the gates of prisons for the organization, while many other governments have denied it entry into their prisons. This is the best proof that we are determined to implement radical reforms in these prisons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added, "We have demanded that the competent authorities and prison officials conduct an investigation into the contents of the report, and I was personally among those who called for the publication and announcement of the report with total transparency."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Mohammed Aziz, the minister of human rights in the Kurdish government, considered the report issued by the US organization "Human Rights Watch" on  prison conditions in the region to be "exaggerated". He explained that it covered the time period between last April and October 2006, during which the process of unifying the region's two administrations was not yet complete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He pointed out that "the ministry agrees with some of what was mentioned in the report", asserting that it "disregarded the recent positive achievements in the region to improve the conditions of prisons, as well as the release of 400 people following the implementation of the General Amnesty Law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Kurdish government denies any violations of the rights of detainees and prisoners in Kurdistan, while Arab parties demand that the fate of 250 prisoners who were surreptitiously transported from Kirkuk to Kurdish prisons in Ukra, Arbil, and Sulaimaniya be revealed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On the other hand, the ministry of religious endowments and Kurdish affairs issued an order prohibiting any political activity or partisan gathering inside the mosques of the region, and stressed the necessity of keeping mosques "places of worship, not of political activity". It also warned that it would take strict measures against any side that seeks to use mosques and other places of worship for partisan purposes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A statement issued by the ministry stated that "the Islamic Group requested a permit to hold a meeting inside the big mosque of Jamjamal, but the ministry refused. In spite of that, the Group defied the ministry and held a meeting under the leadership of its leader. Thus, the ministry of religious endowments and affairs warns political entities against using mosques, which are places of worship, and exploiting them for political or partisan purposes. The ministry will also take all the legal measures against anyone who breaks its rules".</seg>

<seg id="1"> Constitutional Amendments and Calls for Permanent Seat on Security Council... Love-hate Relations with Neighbors... Japan: a Cautious Rush and Timid Ambition to Play a Role Abroad after Overcoming Historical Feelings of Animosity.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One wonders, especially on one's first visit, how to get to know the country that has forced its way into our imagination, although it is thousands of miles away, owing to its economic progress, especially its technological prowess, not to mention its recovery from a disaster which was the worst endured by a people in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What is the secret of this success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How did Japan manage to overcome the catastrophic destruction inflicted on it after the Second World War, and remedy the effects of the United States dropping nuclear bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and rebuild what the war had destroyed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How did the country rise above the feelings of hatred towards its previous arch-enemy, the United States, to become its best ally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In recent years, Japan has witnessed and is still undergoing major changes, the most notable of which is a clear tendency to step outside its "isolation" and become more involved in international activities, which was manifested in amendments to the "peaceful" constitution allowing Japanese forces to be deployed abroad, and the announcement of other amendments, and the call for a permanent seat on the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="7"> What, then, is the secret behind this cautious rush and timid ambition?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> How does Japan view the Middle East and neighboring countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Japan's relations with its neighbors, particularly North Korea and China, are love-hate relations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Japan, a group of islands that extend from the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan, believes that it is a victim of geography (and history).</seg>
<seg id="11"> With North Korea with its ballistic missiles and nuclear program on one side, and China with a doubled military budget on the other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Japanese people are calm by nature; you barely hear their voices; you find them absorbed in their work without becoming weary.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The concern exhibited by some politicians towards the policies of neighbors, North Korea and China, is not reflected in the average citizen, who, as is the case with most people in the developed world, prioritizes domestic issues.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Corruption, surging prices, unemployment, and medical insurance concern the Japanese citizen more than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Despite the fact that Japan will be holding parliamentary elections by the end of this month, citizens seem to be more concerned with domestic issues, most notably the scandal of the loss of pension files.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The representatives of Lebanese political powers arrive in France today for the Lebanese-Lebanese dialog, which is scheduled to commence today in Saint-Cloud, a suburb of the French capital Paris.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Among those who left Beirut yesterday were Dr Mahmoud Berri, and Ali Hamdan, head of the foreign affairs bureau of the Amal Party, who met prior to their departure with Nabih Berri, speaker of the House of Representatives, who provided them with necessary instructions for the conference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A number of participants left Beirut on Friday, and the rest of the participants in the conference, which ends next Monday, are expected to leave today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Republic's Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Qabbani urged the representatives of the participating Lebanese sides, in a statement yesterday, to agree to "restore political activity in constitutional institutions because such a restoration would complement the Arab efforts being carried out by the Secretary-General of the Arab League Amr Moussa to bring together the Lebanese sides, as well as the role played by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, overseen by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, to save Lebanon".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Former Prime Minister Rashid Al-Sulh expressed in a statement his hopes that "the Lebanese would find solutions during the Saint-Cloud meeting, and show a sense of compassion for the people and the country, as was previously achieved in Taif".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He said, "Some have tried wars and conflict in Lebanon, and have not reached any results. Events have proved that there can be no solution unless there is direct contact or dialog between the Lebanese, out of compassion for their country and their own fate".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In a statement after their meeting under the leadership of Deputy Elie Skaf, the Popular Bloc of Zahla Representatives considered "that the unity of the conference manifests the prevalence of the logic of meeting and dialog over the policy of individualism and exclusive power".</seg>
<seg id="9"> And they called upon the ruling party to "make the most of the opportunity in this dialog forum to make an effective contribution, away from media provocation, stalling, and procrastination, to create an environment conducive to a compatible and gradual resolution based on maintaining civil peace".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> MP Antoine Zahra (of the Lebanese Forces) believes that "the Saint-Cloud conference is supposed to lead to a certain truce, and to confirm the possibility of restoring dialog at the leadership level in Lebanon in order to provide solutions".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a statement yesterday following its weekly meeting, the High Council of the Free Patriots Party expressed hope that the Saint-Cloud meeting would create a "hole in the barricade between Lebanese powers, although we are not really counting on any paradigm shift in the dialog, in light of recent signals by the opposition".</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Malik, secretary of state for the Department for International Development, said that he accepts that the "Hamas" movement is essential in the context of a long-term resolution and peace in the Middle East. But he said that it must comply with the terms of the International Quartet Committee, which require that Hamas denounce violence, accept Israel's right to existence, and accept the agreements signed with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While the British minister welcomed Israel's release of 120 million dollars of Palestinian revenues, he stressed the need for Israel to return the rest of the 800 million dollars in withheld revenues.</seg>
<seg id="5"> During the discussion, Malik agreed with Liverpool MP Louise Ellman that Israel has the right to build a separation wall, but he said that building it on occupied Palestinian territories is illegal and unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Regarding Israeli settlements, he said that his government's stance is clear, that is, any solution should be based on the pre-June 1967 War borders, on secure borders for Israel, and on a recognized viable Palestinian state that includes East Jerusalem.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Islamic Party MP Azhar Al-Samaraie has said that her party "demanded constitutional guarantees prior to taking part in the new coalition-first and foremost the granting of a general amnesty to prisoners, and the forming of committees to maintain equilibrium in the cabinet and within each ministry, supported by a constitutional provision ensuring its achievement".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> MP Hassan Al-Sanid, of the "Unified Iraqi Coalition", previously confirmed the opening of official communication channels with the Islamic Party, and invited it to join the moderate political powers venture.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He also said to "Al-Hayat" that "The Islamic Party tentatively approved a working paper containing the fundamental principles that the new coalition is based on", pointing out that "the party is currently exploring guarantees for the implementation of the working paper", and he stressed that "the new coalition is considered a framework for cooperation between the four main blocs (the Supreme Islamic Council, the Dawa Party, and the two Kurdish parties), serving as a driving force for the overall political process".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In connection to this, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani described the "Iraqi List", led by Ayad Allawi, as "nationalist and democratic, bringing together all the different sections of the people".

<seg id="3"> The latter, headed by Judge Sami Mansour, is expected to look into a request that investigator Eid be dismissed from the investigation into the crime, which was filed by lawyer Mohammed Farid Mattar, the lawyer of four plaintiffs in the case.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The task of the Turkish legislative elections' winner today will not be an easy one at all.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Major challenges await him both at home and abroad.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As the Middle East is destined for more turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="5"> A country promised more fears.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The winner need but look at the map to recall due entitlements.</seg>
<seg id="7"> All forecasts predict that the Justice and Development Party, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, which is being demanded to tackle the escalating chaos in the region, will emerge as a winner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> There is a dangerous major entitlement called the Iraqi bomb.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Turkey has adapted skillfully to the US invasion of Iraq. However, adapting to what comes after the invasion seems riskier.</seg>
<seg id="10"> President Bush's ability to extract success from the remnants of his adventures is diminishing.</seg>
<seg id="11"> His ability to resist calls to schedule a withdrawal is wearing away.</seg>
<seg id="12"> A withdrawal would mean leaving the region's nations to face the Iraqi ball of fire and its ramifications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If Iran is the major winner from the US invasion of Iraq, Turkey has come out a loser.</seg>
<seg id="14"> There seems to be a conspicuous imbalance in the Turkish-Iraqi-Iranian triangle.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Turkey's problem in Iraq cannot be summed up by Kurdistan Workers Party militants taking sanctuary in mountain areas and launching attacks from there.</seg>
<seg id="16"> A bigger problem is the establishment of a semi-state in Iraqi Kurdistan, whose relative stability would result in reviving the dreams of the Kurds dispersed across neighboring countries, especially Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Indeed, the invasion of Iraqi Kurdistan is no longer a simple task.</seg>
<seg id="18"> And assigning such a task to the army requires a price in the internal push and pull between Erdoğan's party, which has Islamist roots, and the secular legacy spearheaded by the military.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Such an invasion also has a price in terms of relations with America and the European Union, into which Turkey is trying to worm its way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> There seems to be another challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21"> What can Turkey do about the full blown attack by Iran to seize leadership of the region and worm its way into the nuclear states' club?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Is the Atlantic shelter a sufficient deterrent, or does Turkey also need the nuclear pillow to sleep peacefully?</seg>
<seg id="23"> Last October, I asked the Turkish prime minister in Istanbul about his country's response in the case of Iran carrying out a nuclear experiment.</seg>
<seg id="24"> He answered with a smile, "This is a military question."</seg>
<seg id="25"> I repeated the question and he repeated the same answer.</seg>
<seg id="26"> In Istanbul, I heard that the army has been discussing the issue and insists that it be kept out of the reach of politicians and the media.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> One could also point to many other issues.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The Arab-Israeli conflict, the increasing presence of "Al-Qaeda" in the region, the rise of sectarian tensions, and the prevalence of instability in more than one place.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Here one must note that Erdoğan's government has come a long way in preparing Turkey for a Middle East role, which it has labeled as the pursuit of stability.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It has improved its relations with Syria and Iran, while maintaining strong relations with Arab moderates.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It has maintained relations with Israel and improved relations with the Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Turkey's participation in the "UNIFIL" force in south Lebanon was striking, as was Turkey's attempt to establish negotiations between Israel and Syria, following an attempt to narrow differences between Beirut and Damascus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The winner also has to deal with the European dream.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The launch of negotiations with the European Union does not necessarily guarantee membership.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The measures taken by Erdoğan's government are still insufficient by the Union's standards.</seg>
<seg id="36"> It is not merely a matter of meeting qualifying conditions.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Europe is afraid of immigration, unemployment, and the non-integration of newcomers, and is scared of losing its identity.</seg>
<seg id="38"> In Europe, certain voices argue that Turkey is not European, neither culturally nor geographically, and that allowing it to join would mark a change in the union's identity.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Turkey will most probably remain under observation for many years, despite the European awareness of the importance of its stability for many reasons, including it being a safe passage for energy from the East to the West.</seg>

<seg id="40"> Domestically, Erdoğan can speak of the years of stability that Turkey has enjoyed during his party's era.</seg>
<seg id="41"> He can rely on figures.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The growth rate was about 7% last year.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Foreign investments reached 20 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="44"> Inflation fell from 29% in 2002 to 9% in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="45"> But the battle does not revolve around figures only. The past months have witnessed protests by millions of pro-secularists, revealing that a considerable portion of Turks fear that the Justice and Development Party's commitment to the principles of secularism may be merely a "temporary platform" hiding a secret agenda.</seg>

<seg id="47"> It could be said that this push and pull over the regime's identity and the firm commitment to the principles of secularism are core to today's election test, especially after recent warnings by the army, which senses difficulty in repeating its past experiences of "salvaging the country" from the rule of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="48"> Also, the role of the Kurdish factor in the elections and in raising concerns should not be forgotten.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The "Taliban" movement carried out their threat to execute one of the 23 South Koreans they abducted in the province of Ghazni last week, accusing Kabul of adopting a "dishonest" approach to negotiations, and announced that "the final deadline before the execution of more hostages was 8.30 last night."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The movement's spokesman, Qari Mohammad Yousuf, demanded the Koreans pressurize Kabul to avoid the risk of killing the rest of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="4"> However, the South Korean "Yonhap" news agency, quoted a government official in Seoul, whose identity was not revealed, as saying that "Taliban" has released eight hostages, given that the movement had previously announced that eight Korean hostages had fallen ill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Yonhap" indicated that there were reports of South Korea paying a financial ransom for the release of its citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "Taliban" released Christoph Reuter, a reporter for the German magazine "Stern", along with his Afghan interpreter, hours after their abduction in the province of Konar (east) parallel to the Pakistani border.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Governor of Konar province Shalizay Didar explained that tribal leaders have intervened to release Reuter, who had gone to Konar to carry out an investigation into the killing of 23 people in an air raid carried out by the Atlantic Organization NATO two weeks earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the meantime, a French soldier was killed in a missile attack on an Afghan army barracks in (southwest) Wardak province, where he was in charge of training a military unit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In Pakistan, the Police announced that at least 9 civilians were killed and 41 injured in an attack carried out by Islamists firing five missiles on the town of Bannu in the (northwest) North Waziristan region, parallel to the Afghan border.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Police chief Dar Ali Khattak explained that the missiles, which were fired at half past midnight, destroyed four houses and injured seven policemen. He thinks they were likely fired to retaliate for the army's attack on the hideout of "Pakistani Taliban" leader Abdullah Mahsud, forcing him to blow himself up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Local official Mahboob Khan stated that "the rebels struck locations indiscriminately to cause maximum damage, and to put the government in a difficult position."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The European Union's high representative for foreign policy Javier Solana has asserted that Europe's stance on Syria is "very clear", and that the international community has "set out clear requirements, which I expect to be respected by everyone including Syria. The ball is currently still in Syria's court."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Solana said in an interview to be published tomorrow, Tuesday, by the Progressive Socialist Party's "Al-Anbaa" newspaper that he is pleased with the establishment of an international tribunal into the case of Rafik Hariri's assassination, "though I wished it had been established based on a consensus in Lebanon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Solana applauded the International Investigation Commission and its president Serge Brammertz "for the high professionalism and confidentiality with which it performs its work".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He confirmed the EU's commitment to protecting Lebanon's sovereignty and independence and the unity of its lands, and said he maintains that Lebanon must be "free of all foreign intervention and united in its pursuit of democracy", adding that "ideally, the Lebanese problem should be settled by a Lebanese solution, but until that happens, all of us who wish the best for Lebanon will continue to urge all external players to stop trying to impose their agendas, and to do all that can be done to promote dialog".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As for the presidential elections, Solana said, "I think that as long as the constitutional process is respected, the new president will be able to unite rule for all Lebanese people".</seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> He believes that the Lebanese army was greatly effectiveness in its efforts at the Nahr Al-Bared camp, and said, "I was amazed at the army's enormous display of composure in the face of provocation," asserting that "a positive side to these incidents is that it (the army) has been a rare example of unity among the Lebanese".</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A social humanitarian case of a non-Lebanese family who have lived in Lebanon, and suddenly lost their provider and needed a legal solution regarding the land on which they live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> She bore two daughters to a Syrian husband, who died some time after their birth.	.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After his death, she obtained a custody order from the Armenian Orthodox archbishopric in Lebanon for her two minor, non-Lebanese daughters.</seg>
<seg id="5"> She asked the Court of First Instance in Mount Lebanon, headed by Judge John Al-Kuzai, assisted by judges Alaa Al-Khatib and Naji Al-Dahdah, to appoint her as a guardian for her non-Lebanese daughters' finances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Upon receiving the request, the court looked into the extent to which the matter fell under the jurisdiction of the Lebanese courts, and the applicability of Lebanese law to the matter, considering that all the family members were non-Lebanese. The court examined the international jurisdiction of local courts according to the text of the civil procedure code, which determines the international jurisdiction of Lebanese courts, which applies to the petition filed before the local court, on the grounds that the mother lives with her daughters in Lebanon and that her request concerns the minors' finances in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on these legal facts, which grant jurisdiction to the court, the court proceeded from looking into the request to adjudicating it and determining the law to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Within this context, the court stated in its ruling that "the legislature has settled the problem of conflicting laws through what are known as dispute rules, which are a set of national laws formulated by the legislature or the judge, but which do not provide a direct solution to the issue in question. Rather their role is limited to identifying the law that should be applied as the most appropriate and most relevant to the issue."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The court arrived at the conclusion that "Lebanese law, like many foreign legislations and international treaties, recognized the person's nationality as a basis for arbitration of personal status matters. In this regard, the law of the appellant's nationality should be applied".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The court considered this method to be a conventional method of addressing problems that arise from special international relations. However, the development of this type of international relations has led to the existence of other methods of settlement alongside conventional methods, including the method of immediately applicable laws, which rules out the application of conventional methods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The court explained that "immediately applicable regulations apply unvaryingly to domestic legal relations and international legal relations, regardless of any exogenous factors; because the issues these regulations address touch upon the social, moral and political fundamentals in the country of the judge looking into the dispute, where it becomes impossible for him not to apply these procedures that provide a direct solution to the issue at hand and do not define the applicable foreign law, which consequently entails the application of immediate, domestic legal regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The court addressed "the Lebanese sectarian system, which has led to multiple Lebanese laws in the area of personal status, where each denomination is subject to its own laws, as is the case with the 2/4/1951 law, which applies to all those who belong to one of the denominations of Christianity,</seg>
<seg id="13"> and which regulated guardianship rules and terms with regard to managing the finances of Christian minors. It addressed an issue that touches on the social foundations of Lebanon which secures the protection and care of the interests of this group within Lebanese territory, regardless of their nationality.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In light of what has been demonstrated, the law that should be applied in guardianship petitions, in keeping with what the petitioner is committed to, is Lebanese law, specifically the 1951 law.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Mark Howayek at Beirut Airport yesterday. From right to left: Deputy Hashem and Mr Basil and Deputy Mozaya.</seg>
<seg id="3"> After a period of medical treatment in Paris, Mark Howayek, active member of the "Free Patriotic Movement", who was injured in the January 23 events, returned to Beirut the day before yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4"> He was received at the airport by Deputy Charles Mozaya, representative of Deputy General Michel Aoun, Deputy Abbas Hashem, Gibran Basil, political liaison officer of the "movement", Dr Bassam Al-Hashem, Howayek's family, and "movement" supporters. He also received a call from Deputy Ibrahim Kanaan.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Deputy Hashem considers that "the movement is proud to be receiving its activist, who has sacrificed his soul for many young men".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Basil believes that "Mark's greatest consolation is the public display of solidarity with his cause".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> From the airport, Howayek and the attendees moved to Amchit Square, and were joined by Deputy Walid Al-Khoury. Also, Mozaya said, "Mark came to prove to those taking sanctuary in their palaces and their grand mansions; those claiming to be patriots when they are foreign agents, to have a passion for life when they are reapers of souls; those lecturing on freedom, sovereignty and independence when they are a mere clique of followers; to those who claim to protect the Christian community while they are the ones who called off the Great Friday; to those who claim immaculacy when they have a long history of crime; he came to prove that he is the one who has a passion for life and for Lebanon, a boundless passion. For you are a patriot of distinction and an honest Lebanese. You are the one who boldly defied the concept of hegemony; you are the one who refused the return of militias to our land, and thus have become a role model in our Free Patriotic Movement."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He added, "We, the proprietors of the patriotic movement, want to live in a sovereign, free and independent nation; in a nation that combats corruption and corrupt people and corruptors, and that respects the formula of coexistence.</seg>
<seg id="9"> We want to live in a nation that respects and protects citizens' rights. And to achieve that, we have to elect a statesman to the seat of presidency, not a thief, a foreign agent or a murderer. We must elect a man who represents the sweeping majority of Christians and the majority of Lebanese, a man of courage and honor, a man of valor and justice."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Why don't we turn secondary elections into a new episode of the pathway to democracy, instead of settlements and commendations?</seg>
<seg id="3"> For general elections, or secondary elections, revive the democratic race because the election process is the one and only safety valve for the conception of the state and its institutions, and the only witness to the exuberance of Lebanese diversity.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Commendation, though it might indicate good will, does not feed the democratic process, and it annuls the people's choices and their rights, and we should not be permitted, especially in unsuitable circumstances and in this delicate position, to nullify the main stops, for there shouldn't be any barriers-regardless of any considerations-in the way of our progress on the path of proper democratic practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> There are certain nations that have a very long democratic history, such as Belgium and Australia, that conduct obligatory voting, because they consider voting to be a duty and not merely a right.</seg>
<seg id="6"> There are other ancient nations that exhaust their people with elections tens of times a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two months before the presidential entitlement is due, the most suitable gift that the Lebanese people could present to themselves, is secondary parliamentary elections-on the condition that the Lebanese people partake in the elections with a competitive, civilized spirit that proves their maturity, and proves that they're far from the street lingo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We must be reminded of the benefits of elections, and of the fact that in such circumstances, verbal bombardment is most effective.</seg>
<seg id="9"> One of the obvious benefits is discerning the real magnitude of the different political powers and political movements, whether in the northern contingent or in Beirut.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For parliamentary elections are the only real indicator of the size and magnitude of this or that bloc, which helps to avoid fake displays of heroism here, and amplifying or downplaying the roles and sizes of contestant powers there, and on the basis of parliamentary elections each bloc can prepare for the general elections which follow after a while.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This democratic race under these difficult and oppressive circumstances will prove to the world, that the Lebanese people are capable of severing any plot that targets their political system, their peculiarity and liberties, and that the Lebanese people are qualified to overcome any terrorism regardless of its origins, especially if its aim is to drag Lebanon into the guild of dictatorial states, or states that suffer from the anarchy of internal schisms and foreign intervention.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The height of fear is that Lebanon will start getting used to making choices without elections, similar to what is happening in our surrounding world, after its people are made to believe that the election process is a threat to their safety.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> "The Observer" newspaper reported yesterday, Sunday, that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair launched an aggressive attack on those he called absurd British Islamists, who he said have nurtured a false sense of grievance that they are being oppressed by Britain and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Blair, who resigned from office on June 27, warned that Britain is in danger of losing the battle against terrorists unless mainstream society counters this threat.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The newspaper mentioned that Blair's statements, in which he also attacked civil liberty advocacy groups, were made in a television documentary that will be aired on Channel 4 today, Monday. It was recorded last Tuesday on the eve of his departure from office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Blair was quoted as saying on the program that the idea these people are propagating is that Muslims in Britain do not have the freedom to express their views or their religion, when in reality Muslims in this country [Britain] have more freedom than in most Muslim countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Blair added, "We are not fighting the battle properly, which is why we are finding it hard to win; and also because we are not standing up to these people and saying: it's not just your methods that are wrong, but your ideas are absurd too. Nobody is oppressing you and your sense of grievance is unjustified."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Blair cited the example of the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and said that Islamists have criticized it and considered it an example of the imperialist West's oppression of Muslims, to highlight unfounded claims of grievance.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He wondered how it can be claimed that Afghani Muslims are being oppressed, when Taliban forces used to execute teachers for teaching girls in schools?</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> King Abdullah's visit to Sharm El Sheikh directly after the Quartet summit was held has put an end to the period of rupture and cooling off that has characterized Egyptian-Saudi relations as a result of the dispute over their respective roles in the Palestinian cause, and each one's role in exerting influence and being subject to the influence of this issue; as well as Saudi Arabia's individual domination of the Mecca agreement without inviting Cairo to take part, which was considered by the Egyptians to be an insult to their diplomatic and political role for a long time in their ebb-and-flow relation with the Palestinians; believing that what Riyadh has done is a takeover of a regionally legitimate role.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We will not go over what has been done on the ground to thwart the Mecca agreement, for we are advocates of agreement rather than separation.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is important now is that the Egyptian role has returned to the fore with President Mubarak's suggestion of an initiative for dialog between Hamas and Fatah to reach a state of agreement that will remove the Palestinian cause from the crisis in which it has found itself, as a result of the irrational and immoral fighting on the part of Hamas; which were the words of Mr. Heikel in his latest intervention in the Palestinian cause, this dialog, however, requires a period of time for self-restoration and for allowing familial wounds to heal, and requires compromises on both sides before the negotiation table is approached.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is a suggestion that will be met with approval from Arab political circles and reservations from the leadership of the authority which wants to burn out the different stages by declaring a partitioning policy through premature parliamentary and presidential elections, which presents the conspicuous divorce of a political movement, even if we ideologically disagree with it; it still is influential within the political reality of Palestine, and to eradicate it from the roots while keeping with the rationale of the law would be extremely problematic and risky.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Palestinian position now requires special mediation, meaning mediation that has influence over both sides and that could firstly postpone Mr Abbas's demands for international forces to oversee the Strip, because the Palestinians will otherwise slip into a suicidal circle: the final "liquidation" of the Palestinian cause and this is precisely what the United States and Israel want; for Gaza to be placed under international supervision will open the gates to the old scheme of handing over Gaza to Egypt and the West Bank to Jordan.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> A source from the Portuguese ministry of foreign affairs said on Friday that the "Quartet on the Middle East" will meet in the capital, Lisbon, on July 19, in what could possibly be the first meeting attended by British ex-prime minister Tony Blair as an Envoy of the Quartet.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quartet includes the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4"> American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will be on a visit to Portugal on the same day, and is expected to attend the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Diplomatic sources have mentioned that Tony Blair, who was appointed by the Quartet on June 27 which is the same day that he stood down as prime minister after ten years in office, might take part in the meeting too.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The source at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said I still don't know but I think so...yes Blair will attend, adding that the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov might come too.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In Washington, Sean McCormack, spokesperson for the US Department of State, stated that he cannot confirm whether a meeting of the Quartet will take place in Lisbon next week.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He added I have not heard that all the final arrangements and final agreements have been prepared in order for the meeting to take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In Brussels, a European official that it is unlikely that Arab nations such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will participate in the Lisbon meeting, because the ongoing talks between the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas are proceeding satisfactorily.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The European official said that Olmert and Abbas's progress is satisfactory and the whole idea is to allow this to carry on without interference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Olmert had previously said that he expects to meet Abbas at the beginning of next week to discuss several issues, among them Israel's initiative to release from jail 250 members of the Fatah movement which is headed by Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Israel is holding around 10,000 Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Quartet's meeting will be the first since the take over of the Gaza Strip by the Islamic resistance movement Hamas from the Fatah movement which is led by Abbas in June.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This has led to a considerable shift in the political scene and the security scene of Palestine, for it has effectively partitioned the Palestinians between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Quartet's last meeting was held in Germany on May 30.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Diplomats have said to Reuters that Blair has pursued a bigger role since his appointment as an Envoy to the Middle East, which will allow him to be involved in a more direct and more relevant way in peacemaking.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The European official said that the Quartet will not grant him absolute freedom, but Blair is a major political figure and, to a certain extent, will be able to do whatever he pleases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Quartet determined Blair's involvement in raising funds for the Palestinians, building their governing institutions and strengthening their economic development.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Politicians in Israel and in the Palestinian Authority are not showing, in their private talks, great optimism regarding the probability of resuming talks concerning the establishment of a Palestinian nation.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Olmert's popularity has ebbed, he has also been placed in a fragile position which will not allow him to offer the concessions the Palestinians desire, while the Palestinians face a predicament due to the division of Fatah and Hamas and of the West Bank and Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But the Western forces long to see more stability, and American president George Bush, whose presidency has been marked by the problems in Iraq, reaffirmed that he would like to see a Palestinian state before his departure from authority after 18 months.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> A senior military official in Niger told Reuters that the delegation did not go there to request any mediation role from Algeria as has happened in the past, but to explain the situation and call upon its authorities to support border security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that if Algeria managed to convince the perpetrators of these attacks that Niger would not negotiate and that they should put their weapons aside, it would definitely be of great help.</seg>

<seg id="10"> Algeria has previously played the role of a mediator between the Tuaregs of northern Niger and the government.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The nomadic light-skinned Tuaregs, known for their blue turbans, launched a rebellion in the nineties demanding more self-rule from the government, dominated by dark-skinned Africans, following barbaric raids by security forces, in which a number of civilians were killed.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Most Tuareg groups signed a peace accord in 1995, which promised more development in the north. They reinforced the local government and promised to enroll thousands of ex-fighters in the security forces.</seg>

<seg id="2"> In a rare visit by a Pyongyang top official yesterday, Sunday, the North Korean foreign minister, according to a Philippine diplomat, pledged that his country will carry out its obligations to end the nuclear weapons program.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Pak Ui Chun, who came to office in (May) May, told Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo that the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program are making good progress, without mentioning specific details.</seg>

<seg id="6"> Cristobal added that Pak and Romulo discussed bilateral issues, as well as regional and international issues, including developments in the Korean Peninsula, which took up a large part of the talks between the two sides.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="12"> However, it is unlikely that such a meeting would be held in the absence of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has said that she needs to visit the Middle East region and that she will send her deputy to Manila instead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Pyongyang has shut down the Yongbyon Reactor as per an agreement reached in February during the six-party talks on the nuclear program.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Democratic Korea's nuclear issue escalated in the early nineties. The US government believed that the Yongbyon Nuclear Reactor was capable of producing enough plutonium to make two or three atomic bombs.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Worrying that Democratic Korea would develop nuclear weapons, the United States signed an agreement with Democratic Korea in October 1994 to suspend the nuclear facility in return for two relatively proliferation-resistant light-water reactors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Consequently, Pyongyang said it froze 8000 nuclear rods at the Yongbyon reactor until September 12, 2002, when it announced that it would restart operations after accusing the United States of failing to fulfill its commitments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> China has played an active role in defusing the Pyongyang nuclear tensions by bringing officials from China, Democratic Korea, the Republic of Korea, the United States, Japan, and Russia to the negotiating table for six-party talks.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunis, July 31/ Xinhua/ The Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation recently released a 2006 report on the investment climate in the Arab world, in which it predicted a rise in foreign investment flows into the Arab region during the current year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The report, excerpts of which were published in the Tunisian Al-Sabah newspaper today, Tuesday, says that the corporation attributed the rise to internal attracting factors and external push factors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Concerning internal factors, the report indicated improved national promotional techniques, continuous efforts in preparing the investment climate by facilitating, limiting, and cutting down the cost and time of administrative procedures, while increasing the number of comprehensive service centers, providing necessary information, improving the meeting of deadlines for disclosing data according to internationally recognized standards, as well as Arab countries expanding economic city projects and their basic infrastructure requirements, such as airports, roads, ports and railways, and the commitment of a number of Arab countries to complete their privatization programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It pointed out the external factors that have contributed to pushing investment towards the Arab region, most notably low returns on investments abroad compared to the Arab region, specifically in the field of natural resources such as oil and mining, expanded markets for some service sectors, particularly the tourism, communications and transportation sectors, as well as the boost in the real estate investment market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Another factor in the increase of Arab countries' share in direct foreign investments on the international level was the continued significant growth in inter-Arab investments in 2006, especially in the tourism sector, which witnessed large investments at a reported investment cost of more than USD 25 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The report predicts an improvement in the growth rate of Arab trade, particularly commodity and service exports (excluding Iraq, Somalia and Palestine), which can be attributed to the continued rise in oil and mineral prices, improved entry of Arab exports into global markets due to enhanced quality standards applied to products, and increased efforts in developing Arab exports.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The Israeli authorities had imposed restrictions on his release, including a prohibition on traveling abroad and talking to the media or foreigners without getting prior permission from the domestic security agency (Shin Bet), which claimed that he is still capable of harming the state's security by revealing more classified information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The court in Jerusalem convicted Vanunu of making contact with foreign citizens and journalists and of attempting to leave Israeli territory to go to Ramallah in violation of the restrictions imposed on him since his release in 2004 after spending 18 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Besides six months in prison with enforcement, he was sentenced to six months in prison with suspension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The court announced in its verdict that "although he violated the restrictions to which he was subject 14 times, the court decided to be merciful to him and sentence him to only six months in jail with enforcement."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Vanunu was facing a punishment of seven years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Jerusalem court asserted that "the defendant announced that he considers" the restrictions imposed on him by the Israeli judiciary "illegitimate."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Vanunu was released in April 2004 after spending 18 years in prison, but the courts restricted much of his freedom of movement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Israeli authorities are of the opinion that he possesses critical information that goes back to the period in which he was working at the Dimona reactor in the Negev desert (in the south).</seg>
<seg id="11"> He was convicted after he revealed Israeli nuclear secrets to the British newspaper Sunday Times in 1986.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Mordechai filed appeals several times before the Supreme Court to lift these restrictions, but he was unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Vanunu, an Israeli of Moroccan birth, who worked at the Israeli reactor located near the city of Dimona in southern Israel in the late seventies and early eighties of the last century, insists that he does not have anything new to reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Vanunu, who converted to Christianity, no longer considers himself an Israeli, and to no avail has asked several Western countries for asylum since his release. He complains that he is subject to constant surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Hebrew State has never acknowledged that it possesses a nuclear arsenal, but a number of foreign experts assert, on the basis of the testimony of Vanunu and other elements, that it possess about 200 nuclear warheads and long-range missiles.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Ban Ki-moon Withdraws Report on Desert After Controversy About Content; Report Focused on Morocco's Initiative, Ignored Polisario Proposals</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon withdrew a report he prepared about the negotiations that were held between Morocco and the Polisario front last month in New York. This followed a controversy which was caused by the report's reference to Morocco's initiative calling for granting the Western Desert autonomy without mentioning the Polisario suggestion that calls for holding a referendum on self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Ban Ki-moon stressed the necessity of amending the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While Morocco did not immediately comment on this news, Spanish media sources mentioned that the objections of the Polisario and the countries supporting it, especially Algeria and South Africa, came after Ki-moon's report contained a call for the front to give up its ambition and discuss the autonomy plan suggested by Morocco. That was what pushed the Secretary General of the international organization to withdraw the report from the official website of the United Nations for the purpose of modifying it to avoid escalation within the period of the preparation of the coming round of negotiations this August 10th in New York.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Rabat sent implicit messages to the Polisario and the international organization last week by announcing its unreadiness to negotiate about anything other than the autonomy proposal.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For his part, Ahmed Bukhari, Polisario's representative to the international organization said, "There are two proposals on the table and both sides will deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There is no place for other recommendations or notes which might create problems instead of helping the process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> With regard to the controversy that was caused by the report, a statement issued by the United Nations said, "In the interest of the process" Peter van Walsum, the special envoy of the Secretary General, will present an oral report instead of a written report to the Security Council.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Third Republican Senator Joins List of Critics of Bush's Policy in Iraq</seg>
<seg id="2"> Domenici called for a new strategy and laid the responsibility for failure on the Iraqi government.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A prominent Republican senator joined the critics of the policy of American President George Bush in Iraq calling for a new strategy days before a new confrontation in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Senator from New Mexico, Pete Domenici, who has been a member of the Senate for three decades and is a candidate in the 2008 elections, is the third influential Republican official in ten days to publicly opposes the policy of increasing the +number of American troops in Iraq that is being pursued by the American President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> During a press conference in Albuquerque New Mexico the day before yesterday, Domenici said, "I do not support the continuation of the current strategy." He placed responsibility on the Iraqi government for not achieving sufficient progress to deserve the sacrifices of American soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Agence France-Presse quoted him as saying "I do not support immediate withdrawal from Iraq or decreasing the financing of our troops."</seg>
<seg id="7"> But he added "I support a new strategy that will move our soldiers from combat operations and put them on the way to returning to their country."</seg>
<seg id="8"> He explained, "The Iraqi government is the one that is failing to achieve even slight progress to help Iraq or to deserve the sacrifices being made by our male and female soldiers."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Senator referred to his support for a project proposed to the Senate calling for the implementation of the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that were published last year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> This group recommended following a policy aimed at removing the largest portion of the American battle troops from Iraq by March 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It added that some American troops must stay in Iraq to train the new Iraqi army, to protect American facilities, and to perform fast intervention missions against the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Bush said on Tuesday that the strategy based on sending reinforcements consisting of 30,000 additional soldiers to Iraq, which has now reached its peak, must be given a chance to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Bush said, "If we leave Iraq before accomplishing the mission, the terrorists will not declare their victory and they will not lay down their arms."</seg>
<seg id="14"> Bush added "No, instead they will pursue us from here to our homes."</seg>
<seg id="15"> No matter how difficult the struggle is in Iraq, we must triumph."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Last week the highly influential Republican Senator Richard Lugar shocked political circles in Washington when he said before the Senate that the policy of sending reinforcements does not have chances of success.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In addition, Republican George Voinovich also recommended withdrawal from Iraq.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Domenici's statements came days before the return of members of Congress to Washington after a weeklong hiatus, with the Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, prepared to launch a new attack against Bush's policy in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Senior Democratic officials in the House of Representatives and the Senate commented on Domenici's statements.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said that the question posed is whether the Republicans who oppose Bush "will join the vote to change course in Iraq and bring the soldiers home?"</seg>
<seg id="21"> She added "How long will we wait to respect the desires of the Americans to end this war?"</seg>
<seg id="22"> Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Raid said, "Senator Domenici is right to consider the strategy of the American administration in this war wrong."</seg>
<seg id="23"> He added, "But we will not see the necessary change in the course pursued in Iraq unless members of the Senate like Domenici, Lugar, and Voinovich stand up to the American president and his obstinacy in clinging to this failed policy."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Bush Envoy to Sudan Arrives in Khartoum to Speed Darfur Peace; Security Council Deliberations on Implementation of Resolution to Deploy Forces in Region</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The American President's envoy to Sudan, Andrew Natsios, began a visit to the country yesterday with a field tour in the turbulent province of Darfur. The visit of the American envoy, the second of its kind since his appointment to the position at the beginning of this year only days after a personal attack directed against him by Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir who accused him of hampering the peace process in Darfur and "inciting the rebels in the province against the peace efforts," comes one day after a visit paid by envoys from the African Union and the United Nations concerned with devising a road map for the resumption of the peace negotiations between the Sudanese government and the armed men of Darfur who reject the fragile Abuja agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Informed sources in Khartoum said that the purpose of the visit of the American president's envoy to Sudan, which will last for seven days, is to get to know the developments of the situation and the course of implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement in the south and the Abuja peace agreement in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Natsios's talks will include a number of officials in the country led by First Vice President Lieutenant General Salva Kiir Mayardit, Vice President Ali Osman Muhammad Taha, the senior assistant to the president Minni Arkou Minnawi and Dr. Lam Akol Ajawin, the Sudanese Foreign Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After that he will visit the southern Sudan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Meanwhile, the permanent representative of Sudan to the United Nations, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, said that there have been closed discussions among the countries that are permanent members of the Security Council on some of the potential elements of the draft resolution on the hybrid process in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He expects that the discussions during the current week will extend to the experts and the rest of the member countries in the council. Then a session of the Security Council will be scheduled later to deliberate officially about the draft and ratification of the hybrid process.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abdalhaleem said that the two months of this July and August are characterized by importance concerning the developments on the issue of Darfur, since the Security Council is expected to issue a resolution on authorizing and financing the hybrid process. In addition, the rhythm of the peaceful solution of the issue will increase. He referred to the current visit to the country by Jan Eliasson and Salem Ahmad Salem, the envoys of the United Nations and the African Union, for peace in Sudan, which will be followed by the opening of the Tripoli Conference on Darfur in the middle of this month. Then, in August, the political negotiations with those who reject Abudja will start according to the schedule in the road map.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He also referred to the beginning of the implementation of what was agreed upon earlier, represented in the arrival in Khartoum of the new leader of the African troops and the joint envoy of the United Nations and the African Union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> A representative said that the delegation of Sudan in New York is taking part in the discussions to ensure that the draft resolution on the hybrid process comes in accordance with the established facts and the prior references that have been previously endorsed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Abdalmahmood explained that the Security Council will hold a session next Thursday to listen to a report on a visit made by its members to a number of African countries, including Sudan.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With the advent of the tenth anniversary of the end of British rule in Hong Kong and the return of this island to China after 150 years, the Disneyland Hong Kong entertainment city, which has been suffering from low revenues, yesterday, Tuesday, opened a promotional exhibition in the city of Guangzhou, in southern China, in an attempt to attract more Chinese visitors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The step might be extremely important economically, especially with the Chinese economic opening to the world and the pursuit of a market policy that has so far produced many wealthy people whose numbers have begun to compete with the countries of the Western World.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It is worth mentioning that the exhibition, which was organized by the city with investments of 3 billion dollars, uses multimedia to present many entertaining elements in the city and copies of its contents. It is the first of its kind in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The German News Agency reported that within the framework of the same promotional campaign, Disneyland Hong Kong distributed 270 compact video discs (DVDs) in various parts of China to encourage more Chinese, especially in the southern provinces, to visit it in Hong Kong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Some reports mention that there are more than 100 million Chinese who are doing well financially, which enables them to pursue tourism abroad. With this, Hong Kong is not the only one that will benefit from this tourist flow.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It should be mentioned that Disneyland Hong Kong opened its doors to the public in September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It has not announced any data concerning the number of visitors since it conceded its failure to reach the target number -- 5.6 million visitors -- in the first year.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Moroccan monarch, King Mohamed VI, renewed his support to the project of French President +Nicolas Sarkozy, which calls for establishing a union of the countries of the Mediterranean basin.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In a congratulatory message he sent to Sarkozy on the occasion of French National Day, which falls on July 14th, King Mohamed VI described the Mediterranean project as creative, because it responds to the expectations of the peoples of the region and contributes to the elimination of the real challenges placed on them, as stated in the royal message.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Moroccan king praised the "ambitious" reforms made by the new president of France with determination and steadfastness and with the courage and insight he possesses in order for France to remain a beacon and to enhance its international status.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Moroccan monarch expressed his pleasure with the coming state visit by Sarkozy tentatively next October, saying, "It will constitute another occasion to celebrate friendship, French-Moroccan friendship, and to strengthen mutual activity to support the values of peace, democracy, dialogue, and understanding between cultures."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Sarkozy was scheduled to include Morocco in his first visit to some Maghreb countries but he settled for visiting Algeria and Tunisia after Morocco asked to postpone Sarkozy's visit there because of the busy agenda of the Moroccan monarch, who on the day of Sarkozy's visit to Algeria was in the city of Oujda (in the east).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Rabat justified the postponement saying that it wanted Sarkozy's official stay in Morocco to have all the trappings of a state visit, which is supposed to last as long as possible to allow holding deep and extensive discussions and deliberations that deal with bilateral relations in addition to regional and international issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The office of the French president seems to have been convinced by the Moroccan justifications, and it hastened to deny that there was any passing cloud in the atmosphere of relations between Rabat and Paris. In fact, the French president pledged to return to the countries of the Arab Maghreb to stay there for a longer time. He said that his short visit to Algeria and Tunisia was dictated by other commitments awaiting him at home to prepare for the coming political inauguration as well as commitments at the European level.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Stumbling in Implementation of "Agreement on Wanted People" .. Israel Denies Withdrawal From Palestinian Cities in Near Future</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Efforts by the Palestinian Authority to put an end to the issue of the fugitives considered to be among the al-Aqsa Brigades -- the military wing of the Fatah movement -- stumbled after Israel refused to agree to stop the pursuit of 206 of the fugitives whom the Authority asked to be included in the Israeli amnesty decision.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Israel justified its refusal by claiming that the fugitives on the first list did not surrender their weapons to the security agencies, or did not sign a pledge to halt attacks on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Responsible security sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that Israel basically refuses to stop pursuing 28 of the fugitives in the brigades in the West Bank, most of whom are in Nablus and Jenin, on the charge of their having a connection to the Lebanese Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the head of the Israeli Shabak (internal security), Yuval Diskin, met with the Palestinian Minister of the Interior, Abd al-Razzaq al-Yahya, and other security leaders in Ramallah more than once to try to find an acceptable solution for those fugitives.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Security sources at that time confirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the truth of what was mentioned, but they refused to discuss the details.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Nevertheless, informed sources in the al-Aqsa Brigades told Asharq Al-Awsat that Israel proposed the expulsion of the 28 wanted people from the Palestinian territories, or gathering them in the cities of Ramallah and Jericho, but the Authority refused.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Apparently because of the current crisis, Israel did not submit to the Authority a required list last Wednesday, which would have included about 120 wanted people, according to the Brigades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It should be mentioned that a controversy erupted in the al-Aqsa Brigades concerning the decision to halt attacks on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Leaders in the Brigades rejected the decision to halt the attacks according to Zakariya al-Zubaidi, the commander of the Brigades in Jenin, and they told Asharq Al-Awsat that it is not mandatory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a related context, a spokeswoman for the Israeli government, Miri Eisin, denied news circulated by newspapers and agencies quoting Palestinian officials about the imminent Israeli withdrawal from the cities of Qalqiliya and Jericho.</seg>
<seg id="12"> She said, "Not everything the Palestinians request is implemented."</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Yedioth Ahronoth web site, quoting a Palestinian official, recently reported that the Authority is discussing with the Israelis a plan to transfer sovereignty over the Palestinian cities in three stages, starting with Qalqiliya and Jericho, then Ramallah and Bethlehem, and ending with Tulkarm. According to the source, Nablus and Jenin were excluded.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, the Israeli Army expanded its operations in the West Bank and last night arrested more than 25 Palestinians from different cities in the West Bank, on the eve of the release of 256 Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be released at 9:00 AM, and collected them at the Petunia barricade near Ramallah according to the Israeli Department of Prisons, which declared that it is waiting for the certification of the Israeli Supreme Court following the submission of petitions demanding a halt to the release of Palestinian prisoners, in view of the fact that the Israeli public prosecutor's office has notified the court that the decision is political, and the judiciary has no authority over it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> It should be mentioned that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will receive the released prisoners at the tomb of the late President Yasser Arafat at the president's headquarter in Ramallah.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The dispute between the Hamas and Fatah movements was a renewed showing of the impotence of the constitutional institutions, since the Fatah movement considered Bahr's invitation "illegal," while Bahr called for designating someone other than Salam Fayad to form the new government.</seg>

<seg id="3"> In a statement published in Geneva the day before yesterday, the Commission expressed its "extreme concern, because it received information indicating that the Turkish authorities had expelled 135 Iraqis to their own country early this week."</seg>

<seg id="2"> Kabul - Reuters: A spokesman for the Taliban movement said yesterday that the leaders of the movement have set 7:30 GMT today, Monday, as a final last deadline for the Korean hostages. He said that the movement will start killing the hostages if its prisoners are not released by that time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The spokesman for the Taliban, Qari Mohammad Yusuf, said that the Taliban leadership council headed by the movement's leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, has set this deadline which increases the value of the threat.</seg>

</p>

<seg id="6"> Separate talks between the Afghan government and Korean diplomats on the one hand and Taliban insurgents on the other hand have reached an impasse each time because of the Taliban's demand that the Kabul government exchange prisoners for the Korean hostages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> After being subjected to harsh criticisms for his release of five Taliban prisoners in exchange for the release of an Italian hostage last March, Afghan President Hamid Karzai excluded in advance reaching any agreement with the Taliban.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In his first comment on the last issue of the hostages Karzai condemned the abduction and did not talk about the possibility of making any deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A spokesman quoted him as saying "The seizing of hostages and the mistreatment of foreign guests, especially women, are actions that are contrary to Islamic and Afghan culture and committing these disgraceful actions on our soil represents total contempt for our Islamic and Afghan values."</seg>
<seg id="10"> An Afghan minister said Saturday that force might be used if the talks fail.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Vatican described the abduction operation as "a flagrant violation of human dignity that is contrary to all the basic standards of respect and rights, and it shows powerful contempt for divine law."</seg>
<seg id="12"> Among the remaining hostages are 18 women.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yusuf said that some of the hostages, who are being detained in small groups in different locations, are sick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Mi'raj al-Din Bathan, the governor of Ghazni, said that the medicine that the Korean government wanted to send to the hostages could not be delivered on Saturday because the Afghan team was unable to contact the Taliban.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> He added that the government does not want to use force to rescue the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="16"> He told Reuters, "We do not have a plan for attack.</seg>
<seg id="17"> We are trying to send the delegation to conduct more talks."</seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the Afghan forces, there are also foreign forces concentrated in Ghazni.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The Taliban are still holding one German and four of his Afghan colleagues whom they abducted from a neighboring province one day before the abduction of the Koreans.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Another abducted German was later found killed, with gunshot marks on his body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The South Koreans are the largest group of foreigners who the Taliban  have abducted since the forces under the leadership of the United States and the Afghani forces swept them from power in 2001.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The media department at the Egyptian Interior Ministry refused to give more details.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The official Egyptian News Agency Asharq Al-Awsat quoted what it called "a responsible security source at the Interior Ministry" who said that the security agencies "recently managed to abort the movement of an organizational group that embraced jihadist Salafism formed by citizens of Arab countries" and that "the security agencies succeeded in observing them and arresting these elements who frequently visited the country and remained in Egypt illegally for a period (of time)."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The spokesman continued, saying that the arrest operation coincided with the arrest of 18 members of the banned group the Muslim Brotherhood in the al-Marj district "in northeastern Cairo." All the defendants were referred to the office of the supreme prosecutor for state security, which interrogated them and ordered them to be jailed, asserting that "so far, there is no indication of an organizational connection between these two movements."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="2"> London 7-9-2007 (AFP) - A conference of Pakistani opposition leaders concluded its agenda Sunday in London with calls for the resignation of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and the return of the two former prime ministers, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a joint announcement issued at the end of the conference, which lasted through the weekend, the All Parties Conference stated its opinion that the military regime of President Musharraf "has led Pakistan to the edge of the abyss and it has led to discord and chaos, and it threatens the country with disintegration."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The conference, chaired by Nawaz Sharif, was attended by opposition leaders Omran Khan, Maulana Fazlur Rahman, Qadi Hussein Ahmed, and Amin Fahim, the vice-chairman of the Pakistani People's Party.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The head of the Pakistani People's Party, Benazir Bhutto, was absent, although she had been sent an invitation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In total, representatives of 38 parties participated in the conference, and all except the representative of the Pakistani People's Party agreed that their members of parliament would resign if Musharraf went ahead with his project requiring the current parliament to reelect him before the elections that are expected at the end of this year or the beginning of 2008. This was what was told to Agence France-Presse by Nader Chaudhry, the spokesman for Nawaz Sharif.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Pakistani People's Party decided to reserve its decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Since his dismissal of Judge Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry on March 9th, president Musharraf has been facing the most dangerous political crisis since he came to power as a result of a coup d'etat in October 1999.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Dubai 7-11-2007 (AFP) - The head of "al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb countries" on Tuesday criticized the efforts at developing the relationships between Algeria and France, and he called on France to "acknowledge all the crimes it has committed against the rights of Muslims in Algeria."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a statement published today on the internet, the leader of the organization, Abu Musab Adbul-Wadood, denounced in particular the efforts aimed, as he put it, at signing a treaty of friendship between France and its former colony Algeria.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The statement, which coincided with the visit on Tuesday of French President Nicolas Sarkozy to Algeria, said, "Between France and Muslims there is still a separating wall of skulls and body parts and a raging sea of tears and blood." It added "The true Islamic religion rejects the term 'friendship' with disbelievers" as it put it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> France colonized Algeria in 1830. Its colonial rule over it lasted until Algerian independence in 1962 after a war of liberation during which more than a million martyrs were killed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Abdul Wadood continued his statement saying, "The history of France in Algeria from 1830 until today is all crimes, injustice, hegemony, dictatorship, extermination, killing, exile, and displacement. Anyone who examines this history over two full centuries would hardly find any valid support for establishing even superficial relationships with France, not to mention finding anything that could justify friendship with it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Sarkozy said that he would revisit Algeria in November on a state visit that will be prepared by both countries and will result in "tangible results."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The signing of a treaty of friendship between the two countries collided with France's rejection of an Algerian request to acknowledge the "crimes" of colonialism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The French president has repeated many times that he rejects having his country express regret toward the colonial past and burdening the sons with the practices of grandparents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Abdul Wadood called upon France in particular to "acknowledge all its crimes committed against the rights of Muslims in Algeria. Acknowledgement, as it is said, is the first step toward reconciliation." He was referring to Germany's acknowledgement of what it did to the Jews.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So what is keeping France from confessing as Germany did?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He concluded his statement with a tone that is not free of threats. He said, "If Sarkozy goes too far in his past deception and he continues his insistence that sons cannot apologize for what sons have done, he should not expect the sons in Algeria to remain silent about what was done to the parents."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He also called upon France to stop interfering in Algeria's affairs and to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan and Lebanon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Al-Maliki told journalists that "the past stage, in which we began to take responsibility for security and in which our forces moved into the stage of facing and confronting terrorism with the support of the international forces, gave our personnel more confidence, capability, and expertise to assume the management of the tasks of operations."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem 7-26-2007 (AFP) -- The Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Matan Vilnai confirmed on Thursday that Israel recently allowed the transfer of weapons coming from Jordan to the Palestinian Authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Vilnai told the private Israeli Channel 10,"We allowed this transfer of  weapons although we are not sure that they will not ultimately wind up in the hands of Hamas. But we want to avoid the latter's control of the West Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added, "We hope that with this the forces loyal to Abu Mazen will be able to stand up to Hamas. But we are not sure about that either, although we are doing whatever we can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Wednesday referred to this weapons transfer process, talking about Israel's "various more confidential initiatives" within the framework of measures that have been taken by his government to support the position of President Mahmoud Abbas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The newspaper Haaretz on Thursday mentioned that Israel recently allowed the transfer of more than 1,000 M16 machine guns from Jordan to the Palestinian Authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The newspaper said that it was the largest quantity of weapons to be transferred to the Palestinian security agencies with the consent of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Haaretz said that since the beginning of this year thousands of machine guns have been transferred from Egypt and Jordan to the Fatah forces with Israeli consent.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Washington 7-30-2007 (AFP)- General David Petraeus, the commander of the American troops in Iraq, said on Monday that he "does not believe" that the British are currently preparing to withdraw their troops from Iraq. This was in a speech to the American television network ABC News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is holding talks with American President George Bush at Camp David (Maryland, in the east). Press reports referred to a plan for the withdrawal of the 5,500 British soldiers from Iraq, but Brown's spokesman denied those reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> From Baghdad General Petraeus said, "I do not think there is a plan.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There is a plan for a gradual withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In fact, in recent months they have started to transfer some facilities to Iraqi security forces in Basra (in the south), and they intend to continue with that in the coming months."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He stressed, on the other hand, that the American troops would remain in Iraq until the summer of 2009 to make it possible to achieve permanent peace in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Without referring to a specific date for the withdrawal of the 160,000 American troops from Iraq, General Petraeus said that "it will take about that long," but what is more important is knowing "the number of soldiers needed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In reply to a question about arms contracts valued at not less than 20 billion dollars with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and five other countries in the Gulf, and the possibility that there are Saudi fighters in Iraq, the American general said, "In fact, I am not sure they come from Saudi Arabia."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Washington 8-1-2007 (AFP)- American Vice President Dick Cheney declared on Tuesday that the strategy of sending reinforcements to Iraq has led to the improvement of security in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In response to a question by the American television channel CNN, Cheney also defended the decision of the Iraqi members of parliament to go on vacation for a month. He said, "This decision is better than the two months that they were planning at first." He nevertheless acknowledged that the United States is "eager" to see them perform their tasks better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Last month a preliminary White House report on the effect of the new strategy noted that the progress achieved by the Iraqi parliament is insufficient with regard to the needed reforms, especially adopting the law for sharing oil revenues, which is increasing tension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the American vice president expressed his opinion that the report on the effect of the new strategy, which is scheduled to be submitted in September, will show "achievement of important progress" on the road to the targets determined by the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Concerning the report of the commander of the American forces in Iraq, General David Petraeus, and the American ambassador, Ryan Crocker, Cheney said, "I believe that it will show that we have achieved important progress."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He explained, "The information that I get from people I respect indicates that the Petraeus plan is in fact on the way to achieving results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> After he reemphasized that the decision to strike Iraq in March 2003 was right, Cheney concluded by saying, "We (he personally and President George Bush) will end our term before January 20, 2009, and I think we will be able to leave with our heads held high in view of the fact that we did all that was good for our country."</seg>

<seg id="3"> The al-Qaeda organization showed a videotape filmed the night before last that included the clashes with the Algerian security forces in a mountain in Tizi Ouzou, reaching the terrorist bombing operation that took the life of seven soldiers and the burning of the security forces' cars during the terrorist bombing by means of a bomb that was planted on the highway while security force convoys were passing intermittently.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the tape, a number of people in the al-Qaeda terrorist groups appeared chasing some soldiers of the security forces who had fled from their cars at the moment of the explosion. There were also photos of clashes between the two sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> For his part, Abu Musab Abd al-Wadud, the commander of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb Countries, threatened in the same tape to carry out a series of attacks and terrorist actions against Algerian interests and organizations in many parts of Algeria. He pointed out that this comes within the framework of al-Qaeda's methodology of expanding its operations during the coming stage.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The commander of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb Countries also threatened to target many American and European interests in the Arab Maghreb region, and by means of acts of violence and terrorism to stand up against American attempts to establish the headquarters of the American Military Command, which is known as AFRICOM, in the Arab Maghreb region and the African coast.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Abu Musab Abd al-Wadud, the commander of al-Qaeda, called upon Algerian youth to refuse to join the security forces and the army in the coming stage so that they will not be exposed to harm during al-Qaeda operations against the security forces.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> London - News Agencies:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In an article published by the popular newspaper News of the World yesterday, the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, David Miliband, stressed the strength of his country's relations with the United States, denying talk about a slight transformation in the relations between London and Washington since Prime Minister Gordon Brown took office. Miliband explained that America is still Britain's primary ally.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Miliband wrote that with the new Brown government some are seeking to find evidence of the deterioration of our alliance with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He added that such deterioration does not exist and will not exist, and that nothing will change.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He continued saying that our relations with the United States are the strongest, compared to our other bilateral relationships; we are stronger together than if we were apart, and the values we share give us a real power.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On other subjects, Miliband spoke about participation in the sacrifice for other efforts, such as climate changes, poverty in Africa, and terrorism. These are challenges that cannot be faced without the United States, as he put it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In Washington last Thursday, the new Secretary of State for International Trade and Development, Douglas Alexander, stressed the benefits of a policy based on a multiplicity of parties, which was explained as a slight change in British foreign policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Meanwhile, an opinion poll whose results were published in the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph revealed that two weeks after Gordon Brown assumed leadership, the Labor Party overtook the opposition Conservative Party. The poll showed that 40% of Britons support the Labor Party compared to 33% for the Conservatives.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Everyday, by Mursi Atallah</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> If al-Qaeda, which embraces most of the terrorist operations in the world, is fighting Israel, as is mentioned by the literature of al-Qaeda's media statements .. why has al-Qaeda not carried out any terrorist operation against Israel?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A question that may seem strange, but I believe it is a correct and logical question, because, if al-Qaeda justifies its terrorist operations in the Arab and Islamic countries on the grounds that these regimes have dealings with Israel and that they accept moving on the road to peace with the Hebrew state, ... then why doesn't al-Qaeda take a shortcut and turn to hitting Israel, considering that it is the adversary and the enemy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although some of those who pose this question are seeking to imply that this represents evidence of Israel's involvement in those operations, no one has been able to provide decisive evidence of this. Therefore, such implications are still just doubts and suspicions that do not reach the level of accusing Israel directly, although the content of these implications does not exclude the possibility that al-Qaeda is a subcontractor-agent, whether knowingly or unknowingly!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The truth is that anyone who scrutinizes the content of articles and investigative reports in the major Israeli newspapers will clearly perceive that the Israeli sources that have a close connection to government circles in Israel say with complete decisiveness and confidence that "Israel does not fall within the scope of al-Qaeda's targets." .. This is something that raises a lot of questions concerning the cause of the confidence on the part of the Israelis in not being targeted by al-Qaeda!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If these Israeli sources had attempted to cover this up by the saying that al-Qaeda targets the Christian world, that malicious statement does not aim just to remove suspicion from Israel, but it also aims at the encounter between Islam and Christianity under the umbrella of the erroneous lie, which is popularized in Western media circles that are closely connected with Israel, and which depict al-Qaeda as one of the main models of the Arab and Islamic World.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The fact that is beyond any doubt is that the violence that is practiced by Israel and the flagrant injustice suffered by the Palestinians as a result of its aggressive policy represent the best climate for giving al-Qaeda the opportunity to work freely and the capability of recruiting new generations of extremists under the pressure of the feeling of injustice!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In return, all the terrorist operations carried out by al-Qaeda do Israel a great service by the tendency to link resistance with terrorism, on the one hand, and justifying all forms of aggression and the excessive use of force under the claim of the right of self-defense, on the other hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Frankly, and without beating around the bush, those who are obstructing the holding of an international conference for fighting terrorism are not far from all the questions that are raised and the suspicions and doubts that are repeated in whispers and out loud for which no decisive evidence has so far been available. But tomorrow, under new international circumstances and equilibria that do not allow double standards, evidence may become available, like detailed petitions full of all the evidence of accusations that are waiting for a fair judge to put an end to this repugnant phenomenon called terrorism.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When the State Lies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tempest that was stirred up about the selling of Banque du Caire has not subsided, even after the governor of the Central Bank acknowledged that the bank had reached a critical stage that led to the impairment of its performance, about which it could not remain silent, and the Central Bank was no longer able to bear an additional bill to solve its problems.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Also, the country's budget -- which at its root suffers from a severe deficiency -- was not capable of providing 20 billion pounds to pay its debts and compensate the shortfall in its allocations.</seg>
<seg id="5"> So the government put 80% of Banque du Caire up for sale to a principal investor, after it became clear to it -- belatedly -- that the idea of a merger or an acquisition did not represent a successful remedy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> This simply is the image that reached the biggest segment of public opinion among the non-specialists in economics like me, after a huge debate about this issue between those who understand and who do not understand, and between the defenders of the government right or wrong and its critics on the basis of well-founded political and economic arguments .. foremost of which is that selling Egyptian banks to a foreign investor represents a danger  to the national economy, and it leaves a wide area facing foreign control of financing ofdevelopment projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> However right or wrong the arguments of each side are, the government often does what is in its head, and it will proceed with the process of the bank sale because it is more committed to a plan that has been devised, which it calls the reform of the banking sector, in accordance with agreements with international institutions, the details of which are consigned to the drawers of the Policy Committee and are not made available to the public, than it is to the principles of transparency that they talk about!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, the real problem -- in my opinion -- is not the constraints that led to the sale of Banque du Caire, but the pervasive culture in the government bureaucracy, which is based on hiding the facts, covering up negatives, and burying heads in the sand .. until it explodes all at once. .. The problem of the failure of Banque du Caire appears not to have been born today, but goes back six years. And subsequent governments were not interested in disclosing it and doing something about it. .. This raises a question about the political and legal responsibility of a number of former prime ministers and ministers, during whose time in office the bank's vaults were open for a number of businessmen to scoop up loans without collateral, and abscond with it abroad.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is most likely one of the most important reasons for the failure of Banque du Caire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The political regime in Egypt does not recognize the principle of calling officials to account politically.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There is no punishment for them for the crimes of negligence, favoritism, and the abuse of public funds.</seg>
<seg id="12"> What happened in the banking sector to the point that it drove a principal Egyptian bank to the verge of bankruptcy, is repeated in one way or another in other sectors.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Such as the sudden shortage of water and the collapse of the railway utility and the marine transportation, and others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All as a result of putting off dealing with problems and covering them up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The responsibility for this deteriorated condition of the state's apparatus does not fall on the employees who lie with the knowledge of their supervisors.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because the state as a whole lies and falsifies numbers and data. .. But rather, they occur because of the lack of accountability and transparency at all levels, in spite of the numerous monitoring and accounting systems.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Egypt is intensifying its necessary contacts with the International Quartet and all international parties in order to deal with the current Palestinian situation in light of the sequence of developments and events. These have included the visit by the foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan to Israel last Wednesday in connection with the Arab peace initiative, in addition to holding a ministerial meeting of the Arab League, as well as the visit of the American Secretary of State to Egypt at the end of the current month.</seg>
<seg id="4"> A diplomatic source stressed that Egypt was continuing to give the utmost priority to the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, since it is an urgent issue that cannot bear any delay in continuing to work for pushing towards improving the aspects of Palestinian life and improving the economic situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Javier Solana, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, had a phone conversation with Aboul Gheit during which they discussed the most important results of his and his Jordanian counterpart's visit to Israel within the framework of mobilizing the necessary support for the Arab peace initiative. A diplomatic source explained that the foreign minister is preparing a report together with the Jordanian foreign minister for examination by the Arab League at the ministerial meeting on Monday, the day after tomorrow. The report contains a summary of the most important aspects of the visit, according to what was issued from the meeting of the ministerial committee on the Arab initiative last April 18.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Aboul Gheit told al-Ahram that the international parties, most importantly the International Quartet, will also be informed of the most important results of the visit and the reactions of the Israeli side to the initiative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Aboul Gheit noted that there were ongoing contacts with the International Quartet about the proposals mentioned by American President George Bush in his last speech on the Palestinian situation, and in particular the suggestion of holding an international meeting that will include the concerned parties. He stressed that the Egyptian stance demands that it not be considered enough to work towards achieving measures to improve the life of the Palestinians and support their institutions, but this must also be done concurrently with starting serious political negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The foreign minister stressed that Egypt is assuring all parties that there is a favorable opportunity to restart the negotiations, and that there is room for cooperation in giving the necessary impetus for positive movement, while Israel continues to take effective long-term steps that the Palestinian citizen would feel.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Adil Ibrahim</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Engineer Samih Fahmi, the Petroleum Minister, inspected some new fields in the Western Desert region, the new production facilities in the region, and the specialized petroleum port of al-Hamra, which is considered one of the most important strategic petroleum sites for loading and exporting crude oil. It is considered the main collection point for the crude oil produced in the Western Desert region where about 185,000 barrels are exchanged daily, and the number is expected to reach 225,000 barrels within the coming period.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The minister pointed out that al-Hamra port includes all the elements necessary to turn it into a main center for export through an advanced operational system. The minister called for the preparation of a study to develop the facilities of the al-Hamra oil port and the pipelines connected to it to increase its current export capacity, which amounts to 600,000 barrels a month, to one million barrels a month, and to increase the storage capacity of the tanks from 800,000 barrels to one million barrels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> During the inspection visit engineer Shamil Hamdi, the head of the Western Desert Development Committee, reviewed a report on the development of production in the Western Desert region and the status of production after putting some newly discovered fields on the production map one after another. This will lead to an increase in the production of the Western Desert region by about 40,000 barrels a day, bringing the total production of the region to about 270,000 barrels a day by next April.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The visit included an inspection of the crude oil receiving lines at the port which consist of three main lines, as well as an inspection of the crude oil delivery and shipment facilities through land lines, the storage depots, and shipping station pumps.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The minister also inspected the comprehensive secondary center for fighting pollution of the sea by oil. It contains the latest equipment for fighting marine pollution. He also inspected the port's chemical laboratory, which specializes in monitoring the quality of crude oil and is equipped with the latest modern technological equipment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Petroleum Minister also held an open meeting with workers from various petroleum companies operating in al-Hamra Port: Badr al-Din, Gabco, Webco, Ajiba, al-Hamra, Oil Pipes, Khalida, Janub al-Dab'a, and al-Alamein. The minister listened to their ideas and suggestions for improving performance in implementing the planned time schedules for increasing production.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tokyo - News Agencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asserted yesterday that he will remain in his position despite the overwhelming defeat dealt to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, which he heads, in the Senate elections the day before yesterday. He said, "We must consider these results very seriously," and he vowed to move forward with reforms to build the nation and encourage economic growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> It should be noted that Abe's coalition will not be removed from power because of the defeat in the Senate elections because it holds a large majority in the more powerful House of Representatives, which elects the prime minister. But Abe said he will reshuffle the cabinet in his government in an attempt to regain the confidence of the voters.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He added that the people are calling for comprehensive change in addition to changes in the leading positions in the Party. Abe is facing pressures to resign from inside his Democratic Liberal Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the last 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri quoted former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba as saying that Abe should resign and that if he does not do so the party will soon come to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But analysts said that the absence of a suitable successor to Abe in the Party at the present time might help him to stay in power for some time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Japanese newspaper Nikkei Shimbun mentioned that Abe must quickly dissolve the House of Representatives and submit to the people's judgment. But Abe has ruled out any dissolution of the House of Representatives or holding early legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Despite Abe's refusal to resign, the second man in his party resigned because of the harsh defeat of the party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Democratic Liberal Party and its partner in the coalition, the New Komeito Party, won 46 seats in the elections for the House of Councilors, compared to 60 seats won by the Democratic Party, the main opposition party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The ruling coalition needed 64 seats to hold on to a majority in the House of Councilors. Elections were held for half the seats of the 242-seat House.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Abe's party won 37 seats, which is worse than the defeat it was dealt in 1998 that forced Ryutaro Hashimoto to resign from the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The angry voters deprived the Abe's government of a majority because of a series of scandals and mistakes made by the government in dealing with the problem of retirement pension records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Abe is considered the youngest prime minister since the end of the Second World War. In the previous government he held the position of Secretary General of the Japanese Cabinet.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Yesterday Tehran witnessed diplomatic activity on two sides: the first was the visit of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Iran to discuss developments in bilateral, regional, and international relations, and the second was the declaration by the Islamic Republic that it is studying the "time-out" proposal that calls for halting expansion of its program of uranium enrichment while it waits to receive international inspectors between the eleventh and the thirteenth of the current month.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Chavez started talks with his Iranian counterpart Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad, in his third visit to Iran in two years and the last stop of a tour that took him to Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The visit of the Venezuelan president comes in response to the European tour of his American adversary George Bush. He is trying to provoke the White House by visiting countries whose relations with Washington are tense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> During the visit, Chavez, who supports Tehran's nuclear program, mocked rumors about a Venezuelan "nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="7"> He said, "It seems that I will sign an agreement to manufacture an atomic bomb." He added, "We do not need an atomic bomb because we have one. Our atomic bomb is called the Venezuelan people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Chavez arrived in Tehran on Saturday evening as head of a delegation including the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Energy, Economy, Industry, and Communications. He is supposed to visit with Ahmadi-Nejad today in the energy producing region of Assaluyeh on the gulf to inaugurate a petrochemical factory.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Several contracts will be signed during the visit, one for building 7,000 houses and a petrochemical unit in Venezuela.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mohammad Ali Husseini, announced that Latin America, which Nejad visited last January, is a "region which has good prospects for strengthening our relations."</seg>
<seg id="11"> Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega visited Tehran on last June 10.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Venezuelan ambassador to Iran, Arturo Anibal Gallegos Ramirez, said about the visit that "its purpose is to develop bilateral cooperation in the areas of economics, industry, and politics."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> With regard to the nuclear issue, Husseini reported that his country is studying the "time-out" proposal that calls for halting the expansion of its uranium enrichment program in exchange for a suspension of the effort to impose more sanctions by the United Nations. But he emphasized that "halting the enrichment was not mentioned," while a diplomat in Vienna said that the international powers are discussing proposing the idea to Iran to end the nuclear crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, proposed this idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Husseini said, "(The suggestion) does not include anything new, since it had been discussed before.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But Iran is still studying it." He added, "Tehran is prepared to study all plans and proposals that guarantee its rights in the negotiation process."</seg>
<seg id="17"> He added that the senior Iranian negotiator, Ali Larijani, and the High Representative for Foreign Policy of the European Union, Javier Solana, had discussed the proposal during talks to discuss nuclear disagreement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> But the chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs and National Security Committee, Alaa Al-Din Boroujerdi, stated that the idea of the "time-out" is also not an appropriate solution.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This coincided with the efforts of American President George Bush to get the support of his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for imposing wider sanctions on Iran during their talks in the American State of Maine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> On another front, the newspaper Haaretz reported that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had finally designated Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor Lieberman responsible for the task of thwarting the Iranian nuclear program. This followed deliberations in which Mossad Chief Meir Dagan, Israeli Nuclear Energy Committee Chairman Gideon Frank, National Security Council Head Ilan Mizrahi, Shabak Chief Yuval Diskin, and senior officials in the ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense and the Israeli Army, particularly from the Military Intelligence branch, participated.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Yemen: Suicide Bomber of Queen Bilqis Temple ... Is an Arab</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih said yesterday that the primary investigation into the suicide attack that targeted a convoy of Spanish tourists in Marib Governorate on Monday and resulted in the killing of seven of them and two Yemenis drivers and the injury of others, indicates that the one who carried out the attack was not Yemeni, but was of Arab nationality.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He promised to reveal the details very soon after the completion of the DNA examination of the suicide bomber.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The primary official accusations were that al-Qaeda in Yemen was behind the attack. This was an indication of the possibility that the person who carried out the attack on the Queen Bilqis temple was a Yemeni, perhaps one of the 23 escapees from the prison of the political security apparatus (intelligence) last year after the organization's announcement that it had appointed one of them, Nasir al-Wahishi (Abu Basir), as its new leader, and the distribution of an audio recording of Qasim al-Rimi (Abu Hurayra), who is on the list of the escapees and is a wanted man, in which he threatened to carry out attacks he described as "jihadist against the crusaders and their supporters in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Abu Hurayra denied any negotiation with the Yemeni government, and  said that he was assigned by Abu Basir to make this recorded announcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Yemeni President described the attack on the tourists in Marib as "criminal, terrorist, cowardly, and dirty." He threatened all al-Qaeda elements with the harshest punishment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said, "We will pursue them wherever they are and wherever they go and wherever they hide, and we will inflict a deterrent punishment on them for the crimes that they committed against innocent tourists and their Yemeni escorts and against the homeland, its interests, its security, and its stability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Ali Salih announced a reward amounting to 15 million Yemeni riyals (75,000 US dollars) to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of the terrorist elements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With the arrival of a Spanish airplane carrying the Spanish Minister of Tourism and families of the victims in Sana'a to transport the bodies of the Spanish victims to their country, the investigation authorities started an examination of the suicide bomber's DNA in order to determine his identity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber with a 1982 Toyota Jeep.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Yemeni authorities have made more arrangements and have taken strict security measures for embassies, hotels, and foreign facilities all over the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Yemeni government circles consider the suicide attack a painful strike against tourism, after information was received about European and foreign tourist companies canceling reservations for thousands of tourists who had planned tourist visits this summer.</seg>
<seg id="15"> They said that the Yemeni economy "will be affected negatively and will lose substantial revenues from tourism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In addition to that, the Yemeni House of Representatives harshly criticized the government and accused the security apparatus of dereliction and negligence toward the threats, lately issued by Al Qaeda elements, of carrying out imminent, painful, "terrorist" attacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The House which issued a statement in which it denounced the attack and acquitted the Islamic religion of having "terrorist" elements, summoned Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Dr. Rashad al-Alimi to appear next Sunday before the representatives to answer their questions regarding the dereliction.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Thousands of Palestinians Still Stranded at Egyptian Border...</seg>
<seg id="2"> Defunct Palestinian Government and Several Factions Reject Opening Karm Abu Salim Crossing in place of Rafah Crossing</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Palestinian voices were raised rejecting the entry of some of the thousands of Palestinians stranded in Egypt on their way to the Gaza Strip through the Karm Abu Salim Crossing, or as Israel calls it, Kerem Shalom, located at the point where the Palestinian, Egyptian, and Israeli borders meet southeast of Rafah City at the southernmost part of the Strip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The defunct national unity government and a number of resistance factions expressed their absolute rejection of the replacement of the Rafah border crossing by the Kerem Shalom Crossing as a passageway and an outlet for the Palestinians to the world.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The factions translated their rejection into the firing of rounds of mortar shells and rockets by their military wings at the crossing originally designated for the entry of goods into the Strip and not for the movement of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> These positions materialized after repeated reports of an Egyptian-Israeli agreement to open the Kerem Shalom crossing today, Wednesday, for one day for the purpose of allowing the entry of about 4,000 Palestinians stranded in Egyptian cities such as Rafah, al-Arish, and Cairo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For those Palestinians, including about 600 patients, there is no other route because of the refusal of the Israeli occupation authorities to open the crossing since about a month ago to allow the Palestinians to return to or leave the Strip freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Israel permitted the opening of the crossing for two consecutive days on the sixth and the seventh of last month. Since then it has refused to reopen it, especially after the Hamas movement tightened its grip on the Gaza Strip by force on the 14th of last month.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Israel closed the Rafah border crossing permanently for the first time in the wake of the abduction of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in a commando operation carried out by fighters from the Hamas movement, the popular resistance committees, and the Army of Islam at an Israeli military site near the site of Kerem Shalom on June 25, 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Since then Israel has permitted the opening of the Rafah crossing an average of four to six days a month distributed over four weeks. At other times it remained closed continuously for a month or more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a statement it published yesterday, the defunct government demanded that the Rafah crossing be opened to travelers "so that the Strip does not turn into a big prison."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The government expressed its absolute rejection of "all Israeli attempts aimed at changing the Rafah border crossing (...) to the region of Karm Abu Salim, so that the Egyptian-Palestinian border will remain free of any interference or foreign custody."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Hamas movement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Islamic Jihad movement, the Popular Resistance Committees, and the Martyr Ahmad Abu al-Rish Battalions joined the government in its refusal to allow the entry of the stranded people through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and they demanded that the Rafah border crossing be put back into operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Many of the activists, including dozens of wounded, fear returning through the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is totally controlled by Israel, for fear of being arrested by the occupation soldiers who control all operational details at the crossing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Israel established the Kerem Shalom crossing pursuant to the Protocol for Operating the Border Crossings in the Gaza Strip, known as the Rice Agreement, which was reached on November 15, 2005 in the wake of the Israeli withdrawal from the Strip on September 12 of the same year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The protocol specifies that the Rafah Crossing be used for the movement of Palestinians, diplomats, and others, as well as for the exportation of goods from the Strip, and that it will be under Palestinian-Egyptian control and monitoring by the European observers mission.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It also specifies that the entry of goods will take place through the Kerem Shalom Crossing for about 1.5 million Palestinians living in a coastal strip whose area is no more than 365 square kilometers.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Al-Jama'a al-Islamiya Defies Instructions, Meets under Chairmanship of Commander in Jamjamal Mosque ... Barzani Asserts Presence of Violations in Kurdish Prisons</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The head of the Kurdistan regional government, Nijirvan Barzani, confirmed that there have been cases of rights violations of inmates in Kurdish prisons. Meanwhile, al-Jama'a al-Islamiya in Kurdistan defied the decision of the regional government not to hold a meeting in the Jamjamal Mosque.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At a press conference, he said, "I cannot say that what the Human Rights Watch report contains is true or false. In fact, there are violations. We in the Kurdistan regional government have made good reforms in the prisons, and we have cooperated and opened the doors of the prisons for the organization while many governments refuse it entry to their prisons. This is the best evidence that we are determined to make radical reforms in these prisons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added, "We have called upon the concerned authorities and prison officials to conduct an investigation into what the report contained, and I personally was an advocate of publishing and publicizing the report with full transparency."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Minister of Human Rights in the Kurdish government, Mohammad Aziz, expressed his opinion that the report, which was issued by the American organization Human Rights Watch, on prison conditions in the region, contains "exaggerations." He explained that it included the period from October, 2006 to last April, the period in which the process of the unification of the two administrations of the region had not been completed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He called attention to the fact that "the ministry agrees with some of what is mentioned in the report." He asserted that it "neglected the positive things that were accomplished in the region lately to improve the conditions in the prisons, not to mention the release of 400 people following the application of the general amnesty law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Kurdish government denies that there have been violations of the rights of detainees and prisoners in Kurdistan, while the Arab parties are calling for the disclosure of the fate of 250 detainees who were secretly transported from Kirkuk to Kurdish prisons in Akra, Irbil, and al-Sulaimaniyah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On another topic, the Ministry of Endowments and Kurdish affairs issued a decision prohibiting any political activity or partisan assembly inside the region's mosques. It stressed the necessity of making the mosques "places for worship, not political activity." It warned that it will take strict measures against any party that tries to use the mosques and other places of worship for partisan purposes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A statement issued by the ministry said that "al-Jama'a al-Islamiya asked for permission to hold a meeting inside the great Jamjamal mosque, but the ministry refused. Nevertheless, al-Jama'a defied the ministry and held the meeting under the chairmanship of its commander. The Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs is warning political groups against using the mosques, which are places for worship, and exploiting them for political or partisan purposes. Furthermore, the ministry will take all legal measures against anyone who violates its decision."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Constitutional Amendments, Call for Permanent Seat in Security Council ... Love-Hate Relationships with Neighbors ... Japan: Cautious Rush, Timid Ambition to Play Role Abroad After Overcoming Historical Feelings of Hostility</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One is at a loss, especially on his first visit, how to get acquainted with the country, thousands of miles away, that invaded our imagination with its economic progress, and especially its technological excellence, and even more, its recovery from the most hideous disaster a people have been exposed to in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What is the secret of this success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How was Japan able to overcome the disaster of the destruction it suffered after the Second World War and deal with the effects of the bombing by the United States of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with two nuclear bombs, and rebuild what the war had destroyed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How did it overcome the feelings of hatred for its former mortal enemy, the United States, to become its best ally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In recent years Japan has witnessed, and is still witnessing, big changes -- the most conspicuous of which is a clear tendency to emerge from a state of isolation and be more involved in international activities -- that have arisen in carrying out modifications to the "peaceful" constitution that allow the deployment of Japanese forces abroad, and the announcement of other modifications, and the demand for a permanent seat in the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="7"> What is the secret of this cautious rush and timid ambition?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> How does Japan view the Middle East region and neighboring countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Japan's relationships with its neighbors, especially North Korea and China, are love-hate relationships.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Japan, a group of islands lying between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan, believes that it is the victim of geography and history.</seg>
<seg id="11"> North Korea, with its ballistic rockets and its nuclear program, on one side, and China, with its doubling of its military expenditure, on the other side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Japanese people are calm by nature -- you hardly hear their voice -- but you see them tirelessly pursuing their work.</seg>
<seg id="13"> You will not find the concern over the policies of the neighborhood -- North Korea and China -- that is shown by some politicians reflected among ordinary citizens, who, like most people in the developed world, give domestic issues priority in their life.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Corruption, high prices, unemployment, and health insurance preoccupy the Japanese more than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Although Japan will witness parliamentary elections at the end of this month, the citizens seem preoccupied with domestic issues, the most prominent of which is the scandal of the loss of the retirement pension files.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Representatives of Lebanese political forces to the Lebanese-Lebanese dialogue, which starts today at Saint-Cloud on the outskirts of the French capital, Paris, arrive in France today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Among those departing Beirut yesterday were Dr. Mahmud Berri and the foreign relations official of the Amal movement, Ali Hamdan, who prior to their departure met with the speaker of the National Assembly, Nabih Berri, who provided them with the necessary instructions for the conference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A number of the participants at the meeting left Beirut on Friday. The rest of the participants at the conference, which lasts until the day after tomorrow, next Monday, are expected to travel today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In a statement yesterday, the Mufti of the republic, Sheikh Mohammad Rashid Qabani, called upon the representatives of the participating Lebanese parties to reach an agreement among themselves on "returning political work to constitutional institutions because this restoration would integrate with Arab efforts being made among the Lebanese parties by the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, Amr Moussa, and with the role of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, under the aegis of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz, to rescue Lebanon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In a statement, former Prime Minister Rashid al-Sulh hoped "that during the Saint-Cloud meeting the Lebanese will reach merciful solutions for the people and the country as was done earlier at al-Ta'if."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He said, "Some in Lebanon have tried wars and struggle that have brought them nothing. Events have proved that there is no solution except by a direct meeting of the Lebanese or continuing the dialogue of mercy for their country and their destiny."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In a statement made after its meeting under the chairmanship of Deputy Elie Skaff, the popular bloc of deputies of the Zahleh district expressed its opinion that "the convening of the conference is something positive that gives precedence to the logic of meeting and dialogue over the policy of individualism and exclusivity.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It called upon the ruling team to "seize the favorable opportunity of this forum of dialogue in order to contribute effectively, away from media provocation, procrastination, and delay, to emerge in an atmosphere that is favorable to a mutually agreed upon interim solution based on maintaining the civil peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Deputy Antoine Zahra (the Lebanese Forces) believes that "The Saint-Cloud conference must lead to a specific truce and to ensuring the possibility of restoring dialogue at the leadership level in Lebanon so that solutions can be reached."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a statement after its weekly meeting yesterday, the supreme council of the Liberal Nationalist Party hoped that the Saint-Cloud meeting would achieve "an opening in the wall that separates the Lebanese forces, although we do not have much faith in any qualitative acceleration of dialogue in light of the latest signals given by the opposition."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first Muslim minister in the British government, Shahid Malik, who was appointed by new Prime Minister Gordon Brown last week, participated in a discussion in the House of Commons two days ago. The discussion was about aid for the Palestinian Authority, and it lasted for three hours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Malik, who is Secretary of State in the Ministry of International Development, said that he accepts the premise that the Hamas movement is important in the framework of a long-term solution and peace in the Middle East. But he said that it must comply with the conditions of the International Quartet, which has called for it to reject violence, accept the right of Israel to exist, and accept the agreements signed with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While the British minister welcomed the release by Israel of 120 million dollars of Palestinian revenues, he stressed that Israel must return the rest of the 800 million dollars of these revenues that it is retaining.</seg>
<seg id="5"> During a discussion with the member of the House of Commons for the city of Liverpool, Louis Ellman, Malik agreed that Israel has the right to construct a separation wall, but he said that its construction on occupied Palestinian land is illegal and unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Regarding the Jewish settlements, he said that the position of his government is clear, namely, that any solution must be based on the borders before the war of June 1967 and on secure borders for Israel and on a viable and recognized Palestinian state that includes eastern Jerusalem.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The Islamic Party demanded constitutional guarantees paving the way for its participation in the moderate forces front, while the president of the republic, Iyad Allawi, called upon the head of the Iraqi List, Iyad Allawi, to "contribute by strengthening the political process and the achievement of a national front representing the primary forces that believe in democracy and federalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The MP for the Islamic Party, Azhar al-Samarra'i, said that her party "demanded constitutional guarantees before it would participate in the new alliance. In the forefront of the guarantees is a general amnesty for detainees and the formation of committees for balance in the cabinet and within each ministry. These must be based on a constitutional provision that guarantees their implementation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A member of the Unified Iraqi Coalition, MP Hasan al-Sanid, confirmed the opening of official channels of dialogue with the Islamic Party and its invitation to join the project of the moderate political forces.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He told Al-Hayat that "the Islamic agreed in principle with the working paper that was presented to it, which included the essential principles on which the new alliance is based." He noted that "the party is currently searching for practical assurances about what was mentioned in the working paper." He stressed that "the new alliance is considered a framework for cooperation between the four main blocs (the Supreme Islamic Council, the al-Da'wa Party, and the two Kurdish parties) to be a driving force for the whole political process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In addition, the president of the republic, Jalal Talabani, described the Iraqi List, headed by Iyad Allawi, as "nationalist and democratic, bringing together MPs representing a varied spectrum of the people." During his reception for a number of MPs in the List he expressed his hope that Allawi would contribute "to the strengthening of the political process and the achievement of a national front representing the main forces who believe in democracy and federalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In addition, the government reiterated its desire for the establishment of strategic relations with America regardless of the date of the withdrawal of its forces. Government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh criticized the statements made by former senator Lee Hamilton in which he cast doubt on the capability of al-Maliki to achieve security. He said, "These statements show complete ignorance of the Iraqi situation, which is beset by risks that are not few in number."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In addition, a member of the coalition, MP Abd al-Karim al-Anazi, told Al-Hayat that "the expected American-Iranian meeting in Baghdad will discuss the selection of representatives of the three countries on the joint security committee, the mechanisms for making the work of this committee effective, and means for cooperation among its members."</seg>

<seg id="20"> There is another challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21"> What does Turkey do about the comprehensive attack that Iran is launching to snatch leadership in the region and enter the club of the nuclear countries?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Is the Atlantic umbrella considered a sufficient deterrent, or does it also need a nuclear pillow to sleep reassured?</seg>
<seg id="23"> Last October, I asked the Turkish prime minister in Istanbul about his country's response if Iran conducts a nuclear experiment.</seg>
<seg id="24"> He replied smiling, "That is a military question."</seg>
<seg id="25"> I repeated the question and he repeated the answer.</seg>
<seg id="26"> In Istanbul I heard that the army is discussing this matter and insists on keeping it out of reach of the politicians and the media.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is possible as well to refer to many issues.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The Arab-Israeli conflict, the increasing presence of al-Qaeda in the region, the growth of sectarian tensions, and the prevalence of instability in more than one place.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Here we must note that the government of Erdogan has made progress towards preparing Turkey for a Middle Eastern role, putting it under the banner of the search for stability.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It has improved its relations with Syria and Iran while retaining strong relations with the moderate Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It has retained its relationship with Israel and it has improved its relationship with the Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="32"> The participation of Turkey in the UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon was noteworthy. Also noteworthy was that Turkey tried to open the door to negotiations between Israel and Syria after an attempt to narrow the disagreement between Beirut and Damascus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The winner also has to deal with the European dream.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Launching the negotiations with the European Union does not mean that membership is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The measures that the government of Erdogan has taken are still not enough according to the Union's criteria.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The issue goes far beyond the conditions for qualification.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Europe is afraid of immigration, unemployment, and the newcomers' failure to assimilate. It also fears for its identity.</seg>
<seg id="38"> In Europe, voices are openly saying that Turkey is not European either culturally or geographically, and that its membership would be an alarming indication of a change in the union's identity.</seg>
<seg id="39"> The predominant idea is that Turkey will remain subject to monitoring for many years despite the Europeans' realization of the importance of its stability for many reasons, including its being a safe passage for energy from the east to the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> On the domestic side, Erdogan can talk about the years of stability that Turkey has gone through during his party's time.</seg>
<seg id="41"> He can rely on the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The rate of growth was about seven percent last year.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Foreign investments amounted to 20 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="44"> Inflation decreased from 29 percent in the year 2002 to nine percent in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="45"> But the battle is not only around figures. The past months have witnessed demonstrations by millions of advocates of secularism, which have revealed the fear of a not insubstantial portion of the Turks that the adherence of the Justice and Development Party to the values of secularism is merely "a temporary program" hiding a secret agenda.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> In spite of all the reassurances Erdogan has given, a not insubstantial section of the people did not accept the possibility of seeing Abdullah Gul occupying the seat of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk while his wife is wearing the veil.</seg>
<seg id="47"> This contention over the identity of the regime and strict adherence to the values of secularism can be said to be at the heart of the electoral test today, especially after recent warnings by the army, which senses the difficulty of repeating its previous experiences in "rescuing the country" from the civilian rule.</seg>
<seg id="48"> This is not to forget the role of the Kurdish factor in the elections and in stirring up fears.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> While the winds of racism are blowing on the region all the way to Pakistan, the Turks are heading to the ballot boxes today to impose on the winner the burden of facing the challenges both at home and abroad.</seg>
<seg id="50"> These are elections that concern the Turks, as they concern those whose misfortune it was to be born in this turbulent part of the world.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Taliban carried out its threat to execute one of the 23 South Koreans whom it kidnapped in the state of Ghazni last week. It accused Kabul of using negotiating tactics that are "dishonest." It declared that "its final deadline before executing more hostages would end at 8:30 yesterday evening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The movement's spokesman, Qari Muhammad Yusuf, called upon the Koreans to apply pressure on Kabul to avoid the risk of killing the remaining hostages.</seg>
<seg id="4"> But the South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted a government official in Seoul, whose identity it did not reveal, that the Taliban had released eight hostages. Note that the movement had announced earlier that "eight Korean hostages are ill."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Yonhap referred to reports that South Korea had paid a financial ransom for the release of its citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Taliban released a reporter for the German magazine Stern, Christoph Reuter, and his Afghani translator, after it kidnapped them and held them for hours in the state of Kunar (East) along the border with Pakistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The governor of the state of Kunar, Shalizai Didar, explained that tribal leaders intervened to free Reuter who had gone to Kunar to investigate the killing of 23 people in an air raid carried out by the Atlantic alliance (NATO) two weeks earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On another subject, a French soldier was killed in a rocket attack on an Afghan army barracks in the province of Wardak (southwest), where he was training a military unit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In Pakistan, the police announced the killing of at least nine civilians and the wounding of 41 others in an attack carried out by Islamists who launched five rockets at the town of Banu in the province of North Wazirstan (northwest) along the border with Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The chief of police, Dar Ali Khatak, explained that the rockets, which were launched a half hour apart after midnight, destroyed four houses and led to the injury of seven policemen. They were most likely in revenge for the army's attack the day before yesterday on the hideout of the leader of Taliban Pakistan, Abdallah Mahsoud, which forced him to blow himself up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> A local official, Mahboub Khan, said that "the insurgents fired at locations indiscriminately to cause the greatest amount of losses, and put the government in an uncomfortable situation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The suicide operations and attacks that have targeted the army and the police in the tribal regions in the last two weeks have multiplied, after the Pakistani Army attacked the Red Mosque in Islamabad where it killed about 100 Islamists.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The European Union's high coordinator for foreign policy, Javier Solana, asserted that the European position with regard to Syria is "very clear," and that the international community "has set clear requirements which I expect will be respected by everyone, including Syria. The ball is now still in Syria's court."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a statement to be published tomorrow, Tuesday, by the newspaper al-Anba', which speaks for the Progressive Socialist Party in Lebanon, Solana said that he is happy that the international court will take up the case of President Rafiq al-Hariri's assassination, "although I wish it had been established after obtaining agreement on it in Lebanon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Solana sent congratulations to the international investigation committee and its chairman, Serge Brammertz, "on the high level of professionalism and confidentiality with which it is managing its operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He stressed the commitment of the European Union to protecting the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon and the unity of its land. He said that he is still committed to a Lebanon that is "free from foreign intervention and united in its quest for democracy." He added that "the Lebanese problem is ideally dealt with by a Lebanese solution. But until that happens, all who want the best for Lebanon will continue to urge all the foreign players to stop imposing their agenda and do all that is needed to encourage dialogue."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> With respect to the value of the presidential elections, Solana said, "I think that if the constitutional process is respected, then the new president will be capable of unifying the government for all the Lebanese people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He expressed his opinion that the Lebanese Army is highly effective in the efforts it is making in the Nahr al-Barid Camp. He said, "I was amazed at the great self-restraint that it showed, especially in the face of provocations." He stressed that "one of the positive aspects of these incidents is that (the army) is a rare example of unity among the Lebanese."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Humanitarian and Guardianship Problem Meant Application of Lebanese Law on Foreign Family; Percentage of Readers 1.72%</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There is a social humanitarian case in which a non-Lebanese family that lived in Lebanon suddenly lost its breadwinner and needed a legal resolution in the country in which it resided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> She has two daughters from a Syrian husband who died a while after their birth.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After the death, she obtained a custody decision from the Armenian Orthodox Archdiocese in Lebanon for her two non-Lebanese minor daughters.</seg>
<seg id="5"> She asked the court of first instance in Jabal Lubnan, headed by Judge John al-Qazi, and with Judge Ala' al-Khatib and Naji al-Dahdah as members, to appoint her manager of her non-Lebanese daughters' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When the court received the request, the court studied the extent of the jurisdiction of Lebanese courts to adjudicate the case, and the extent to which Lebanese law is applicable to it, considering that all the members of this family are non-Lebanese. It studied the international jurisdiction of local courts according to the wording of the principles of civil procedure law that specified the international jurisdiction of Lebanese courts. One of them applies to the motion presented before the local court since the mother is living with her two daughters in Lebanon and the request that she submitted concerns the money of two minors in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the basis of these legal facts, which give it jurisdiction, the court moved from deciding the form of the mother's request to examining it in principle and determining the law that must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Within this framework, the court reached an independent judgment and said in its decision, "The legislator resolved the problem of conflicting laws by what is called the rules of disputation. These are national rules enacted by the legislator or the judge, but they do not give a direct solution to the matter under discussion, and their role is limited to the determination of the law that must be applied, considering it the law that is most appropriate for and most connected with judging the relation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It decided that "Lebanese law, like many foreign laws and international treaties, depends on the nationality of the person as a criterion for attribution in personal status issues. In this area it stipulates the application of the law of the litigant's nation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> It considered this approach to be a traditional method for treating the problems that arise from personal international relations. But the development of this kind of international relations led to other methods for solution alongside the traditional method, including the approach of laws of immediate application, which exclude the application of the traditional way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> It explained that "the rules of direct application are applied equally to domestic legal relations and international legal relations regardless of any external element, because the issues they deal with touches on the social, ethical, and political foundations of the country of the judge who is examining the dispute, so that it becomes impossible for him not to apply it, and they are given a direct solution to the issue at hand, and do not prescribe that the foreign law must be applied. Consequently, the immediate domestic legal rules must be applied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> It dealt with "the Lebanese sectarian system that led to the multiplicity of Lebanese personal status laws, so that each sect is subject to a law specific to it, as is the situation with Law 2/4/1951, which is applied to all who belong to one sect, namely Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="13"> It regulated the rules of custodianship and its conditions for managing the money of Christian minors. It deals with one of the matters that touch on the Lebanese social foundations, which mandate ensuring protection and care in the interests of this sect on Lebanese soil regardless of nationality.</seg>
<seg id="14"> According to what was presented, the law that must be applied in guardianship requests, as the plaintiff claims, is Lebanese law, and specifically law 1951.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Mark Howaik, at Beirut airport yesterday, appeared to the right of MP Hashem, Mr. Bassil, and MP Mozaya.</seg>
<seg id="3"> After a period of treatment in Paris, the activist in the Free Patriotic Movement, Mark Howaik, who was injured in the events of last January 23, returned the night before last to Beirut.</seg>
<seg id="4"> He was received at the airport by the representative of MP General Michel Aoun, MP +Chamel Mozaya, MP Abbas Hashem, the Movement's official for political communications, Jubran Bassil, Dr. Bassam al-Hashim, Howaik's family, and supporters from the Movement. He received a call from MP Ibrahim Kan'an.</seg>
<seg id="5"> MP Hashem expressed his opinion that "the Movement is proud to receive its fighter who sacrificed for many of the youth."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Bassil was of the opinion that "the great consolation for Mark is the gathering around him through the great solidarity with his case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> From the airport, Howaik and those present were taken to Amsheet square. They were joined by MP Waleed Khory. Mozaya said, "Mark has come to prove to those who withdraw into their palaces or retire into their government houses; those who claim patriotism, but are actually agents; those who claim to love life, but kill; those who lecture about freedom, sovereignty, and independence, but are subordinate followers; those who claim to protect the Christian community, but are the ones who cancelled the great Friday; those who claim innocence, but have records replete with criminality -- he came to prove that it is he who loves life and who loves Lebanon, without limits. So you are the patriot par excellence and the honorable Lebanese, you who confronted the logic of hegemony with the utmost courage, you who rejected the return of the militias to our regions so that you became a model to follow in the Free Patriotic Movement."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He added, "We are the owners of the national project. We want to live in a homeland that is sovereign, free, and independent, in a homeland that fights corruption, those who cause corruption and corrupt people, and a homeland that respects the formula of coexistence.</seg>
<seg id="9"> We want to live in a country that respects and protects the right of the citizen. To achieve all this, we have to elect a statesman to the presidency, not a thief, or an agent, or a murderer. We have to elect the man who represents the overwhelming majority of the Christians and the majority of the Lebanese, a man of courage and honor, a man of bravery and justice."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Why don't we use the local elections to write a new chapter in the path to democracy instead of settlements and recommendations?</seg>
<seg id="3"> General elections or local elections revive the democratic game because they alone are the safety valve for the concept of the state and the institutions, and they bear witness to the vitality of Lebanese diversity.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The recommendation, even if it is evidence of good intentions, does not nourish democracy. It nullifies the options and right of the citizens, and we should not, especially in inappropriate circumstances or a critical situation, destroy the essential bases, so there is no obstacle, whatever the considerations may be, in front of our progress in the healthy practice of democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> There are countries with a long history of democracy, like Belgium and Australia, that rely on compulsory voting because they consider voting not only a right but also a duty.</seg>
<seg id="6"> There are other countries with a long history that exhaust their people with elections dozens of times a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two months before the presidency is due, the best gift the Lebanese people can give to itself, is the local parliamentary elections, provided that the Lebanese embark upon it with a civilized competitive spirit, asserting their maturity, and keeping away from the language of the street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We must be reminded of the benefits of the elections, and in these circumstances, where mudslinging is at its peak.</seg>
<seg id="9"> One of the most prominent benefits is knowing the real political weight of the political forces and movements, whether in the north in al-Matn, or in Beirut.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The representative elections alone indicate the real weight of one team or another, which prevents empty boastfulness by one team or exaggeration or diminution by another. Accordingly, each team can make preparations for the general elections after a while.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This democratic sport, in these difficult and overpowering circumstances, will prove to the world that the Lebanese people are capable of nipping in the bud every conspiracy against its government, its private elements, and its freedoms, and that it has the ability to triumph over all terrorism, whatever its source, especially if its aim is to force Lebanon into the club of dictatorial countries, or the club of those countries that suffer from the chaos of internal divisions and foreign intervention.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The biggest fear is that Lebanon will become accustomed to choosing without elections, as happens in our surrounding world, after its people become convinced that elections are a threat to it.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The newspaper the Observer, published yesterday, Sunday, reported that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is launching a violent attack against those he called the absurd Islamists of Britain, who he said harbored a false feeling of injustice, imagining that they are subjected to oppression by Britain and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Blair, who resigned from his post last June 27th, warned that Britain is facing the danger of losing the battle against the terrorists unless mainstream society stands up against this threat.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The newspaper pointed out that Blair's statements, in which he also attacked civil liberties defense groups, came in a documentary television program that will be broadcast by Channel Four today, Monday. It was recorded last Tuesday on the eve of his departure from power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the program, Blair is quoted as saying the idea they are spreading is that Muslims in Britain do not enjoy the freedom to express their opinions or their religion. The truth is that the Muslims in this country (Britain) have more freedom than most Muslim countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Blair added, "We have not plunged into battle properly, which has caused us to find it difficult to win, and because we are not standing up against those people and telling them, 'Your methods are not only wrong, but your ideas are also absurd; no one is persecuting you, and your feeling of injustice cannot be justified.'"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Blair cited the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and said that the Islamists criticized it and considered it an example of oppression of Muslims by western imperialism to put a spotlight on grievances that never existed in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He wondered how it could be claimed that the Afghani Muslims are subjected to oppression when the Taliban forces used to execute teachers who taught females at school.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The visit of King Abdallah to Sharm al-Sheikh, directly after the Quartet summit conference, put an end to the period of alienation and coldness in Egyptian-Saudi relations due to disagreement about their roles in the Palestinian issue. There is disagreement over their roles in influencing and being influenced by this issue, and over Saudi Arabia's exclusive role in the Mecca Agreement, in which Cairo did not participate. The Egyptians considered this an insult to their diplomatic and political role over a long period of an ebb-and-flow relationship with the Palestinians. They consider what Riyadh did was to hijack their legitimate role in the region.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We are not referring to what was done on the ground to bring about the failure of the Mecca Agreement. We are supporters of agreement and not dissension.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The thing that is important now is that the Egyptian role has returned to the forefront through President Mubarak's proposal of a dialogue initiative between Hamas and Fatah for the purpose of reaching agreement on getting the Palestinian issue out of the crisis in which it has found itself as a result of the illogical and unethical fighting by Hamas. This was what Professor Heikal mentioned in his recent meddling in the Palestinian issue. This dialogue, however, needs a period for recuperation and healing of the family wound and concessions from both sides before reaching the negotiating table.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is a proposal that is marketable in Arab political circles, but which will be received with reservations by the Authority's leadership, which wants to scrap the process by announcing a policy of fragmentation by premature legislative and presidential elections. It is an irrevocable divorce with a political movement. And even if we disagree with it ideologically, it has an influence on the Palestinian political reality. Uprooting it according to the logic of the law would be extremely difficult and dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Palestinian situation is now in need of a special kind of mediation. It needs mediation that can influence both parties by first delaying Mr. Abbas's request for international forces to supervise the Strip, because the Palestinians will enter a suicidal cycle -- in other words, the final liquidation of the Palestinian issue, which is what the United States and Israel want. Putting Gaza under international supervision will open the door to the old plan of handing Gaza over to Egypt and giving the Bank to Jordan.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> A source in the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that the Quartet for mediation in the Middle East will meet in the capital Lisbon on July 19 in what might be the first meeting attended by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as an envoy for the Quartet.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quartet for mediation includes the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4"> American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will visit Portugal on that day and she is expected to attend the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Diplomatic sources mentioned that Tony Blair, who was appointed by the Quartet on June 27 -- the same day he resigned from power after 10 years -- may also participate in the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "I still do not know, but I believe, .. yes, that Blair will attend." He added that Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov may also come.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In Washington, American State Department Spokesman Shawn McCormack said that he could not confirm that a meeting of the Quartet will be held in Lisbon next week.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He added, "I did not hear that all the final arrangements and the final agreements were prepared for holding a meeting."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In Brussels, a European official said that Arab countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are not likely to participate in the Lisbon meeting because the talks taking place between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are going well.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The European official said the path of Olmert and Abbas is going well, and the idea is to let that continue without interference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Olmert said that he expects to meet with Abbas at the beginning of next week to discuss a number of issues, including Israel's initiative for the release from prison of 250 members of the Fatah movement, which is led by Abbas.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Niger Requests Algerian Assistance in Fighting Insurgents in Desert</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Officials said that the prime minister of Niger and army leaders are meeting on Sunday with Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the president of the neighboring state of Algeria, to discuss cross-border cooperation in fighting insurgents led by Tuareg tribes in the desert of northern Niger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The insurgent Niger Movement for Justice has killed at least 36 soldiers and holds dozens captive since the start of a rebellion in February calling for more autonomy for the vast region around the ancient desert city of Agadez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The government refuses to negotiate with the group and says that they are drug traffickers and contemptible gangs, but it has asked neighboring countries to try to prevent the flow of weapons, fuel, and food that are believed to reach them from other armed desert groups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Some officials and civil society organizations in Niger accuse Libya of supporting the insurgents, who also target the mining facilities in a region that contains some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world as well as oil reserves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A senior military official in Niger told Reuters that the delegation did not go to ask Algeria to play any role in mediation, as was the case in the past, but to explain the situation and to ask its authorities to support border security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The official, who stipulated that his name not be published, added, of course, if Algeria could persuade the people who are carrying out these attacks that Niger will not negotiate and that they have to lay down their weapons, that would be extremely helpful.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The delegation includes Prime Minister Seine Oumarou, Minister of Foreign Affairs Aichatou Mindaoudou, the commander of the armed forces, Mu'mini Burima, and General Abduh Kadha, the national security advisor to President Tandja Mamadou.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The official Algerian news agency said that President Bouteflika received the delegation on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In the past, Algeria played the role of mediator between the Tuaregs of northern Niger and the government.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The nomadic Tuaregs, who have light skin and who are known for their blue turbans, launched a rebellion in the 90s to demand more autonomy from the government, which is dominated by dark-skinned Africans, after a ferocious campaign by the security forces in which a number of civilians were killed.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Most of the Tuareg groups signed a peace agreement in 1995 that promised more development in the north, strengthened the local government, and promised to include thousands of the former fighters in the security forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insurgent movement says that these peace agreements were not fully respected, and that the north is still marginalized.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The government says that the great majority of the Tuaregs' demands in the 90s were fulfilled.</seg>

<seg id="2"> A Filipino diplomat said that, during a rare visit made by a high-ranking official from Pyongyang, the foreign minister of North Korea promised yesterday, Sunday, to implement his country's commitments to end the nuclear weapons program.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="12"> But it is unlikely that such a meeting will be held in the absence of American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who said that she is has to visit the Middle East region and that she will send her deputy to Manila in her place.</seg>

<seg id="13"> Pyongyang closed the Yongbyon reactor pursuant to an agreement reached in February during the six-party talks on the nuclear program.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The report, excerpts of which are quoted in the Tunisian newspaper As-Sabah published today, Tuesday, said that the organization attributed this increase in the share of the Arab countries to internal pull factors and external push factors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The report added that, as far as the internal factors go, Qatari marketing methods had improved and efforts to prepare the climate for investment had continued. This was accomplished by simplifying and reducing the number of bureaucratic procedures and the cost and time needed to carry them out, increasing the number of comprehensive service centers,  providing the necessary information, improving the extent of compliance with schedules for disclosing data and the extent of its coverage according to internationally agreed upon standards. In addition, the Arab region has expanded the areas where economic city projects are created, and the necessary essential infrastructure of airports, roads, ports, and railways has been improved. Furthermore, a number of Arab countries have committed to continuing privatization programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It noted external factors that contributed to driving investment to the Arab region. Among the most prominent of these factors is the decrease in yields on investments on the outside compared with their equivalent yields inside the Arab region. This applies specifically to the field of natural resources, such as oil and mining. Another factor is the expansion of the market for some activities in the service sectors. Among the most important of these sectors are the tourism, communications, and transportation sectors in their various manifestations. Also important is the boom in the real estate investment market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The continuing remarkable growth of inter-Arab investments during 2006, especially in the tourism sector, also contributed to the increased share of the Arab countries in direct foreign international investments. The tourism sector has witnessed huge investments, its declared investment amount exceeding 25 billion US dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The report expected improvement in the movement of the growth of Arab trade, especially exports (except for Iraq, Somalia, and Palestine) of goods and services. It explained that this was justified by the effect of the continued rise in the prices of oil and metals and improved revenues from Arab exports to the international markets due to the improved quality standards applied to its products and increased efforts towards developing Arab exports.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Israeli Spy Vanunu Sentenced Again to Six Months in Prison for Violating Probation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Israeli spy Mordechai Vanunu, involved in the nuclear sector, was sentenced again to six months in prison with enforcement because he violated the restrictions imposed on him since his release in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Israeli authorities imposed conditions for his release, including prohibition against foreign travel and talking to media outlets and foreigners without getting previous authorization from the internal security apparatus (Shin Bet) who claimed he is still capable of hurting the state security by revealing more secret information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The court in Jerusalem found Vanunu guilty of communicating with foreign national and journalists and of attempting to leave the Israeli territories to head to Ramallah, a violation of his probation, imposed on him since 2004, after spending 18 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In addition to a six-month prison sentence with enforcement, he received a six-month suspended sentence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The court announced its verdict "although he violated his probation 14 times, the court decided to have mercy on him and sentence him to six months in prison with enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Vanunu was facing a seven-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Jerusalem court confirmed that "the defendant announced that he considered" the restrictions that were imposed on him by the Israeli judiciary as "illegal".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Vanunu was released in April 2004 after he spent 18 years in prison, but the decision limited a lot of his free movement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Israeli authorities regard him as having sensitive information that dates back to the era when he used to work at the Dimona reactor in the Negev Desert (South).</seg>
<seg id="11"> He was convicted after he revealed Israeli nuclear secrets in 1986 to the "Sunday Times" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Mordechai appealed a number of times before the higher court to remove these restrictions, but to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Vanunu, a Moroccan-born Israeli who worked at the nuclear reactor near the city of Dimona, south of Israel, at the end of the 70's and the beginning of the 80's in the last century, insists that he doesn't have anything new that can be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Vanunu, who converted to Christianity, no longer considers himself an Israeli, and he sought asylum a number of times, to no avail, in a number of Western countries since he was released. He complains of being subjected to constant monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Jewish state has never admitted having a nuclear arsenal, but a number of foreign experts insist, based on Vanunu's testimony and other factors, that it has around 200 nuclear warheads and long range missiles.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, withdrew his report on the discussions between Morocco and the Polisario Front in New York because of an argument caused by the report's mention of Morocco's initiative, which calls for giving the Western Sahara a self-rule without mentioning the front's suggestion that calls for conducting a survey on self determination.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Ban Ki-moon mentioned the necessity to amend the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While Morocco did not comment immediately on this news, Spanish news sources said the objections of Polisario and supporting countries, especially Algeria and South Africa, came after Ban Ki-Moon's report included a call for the front to give up its ambition and discuss the plan of self-rule suggested by Morocco.  This led the Secretary General for the international organization to withdraw the report from the official website of the United Nations to add amendments to it, in order to avoid escalation during the preparation for the next round of discussions on August 10th in New York.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Rabat sent implicit letters to the Polisario and the international organization last week, announcing its unreadiness to discuss anything outside the suggestion of self-rule.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For his part, Ahmed Boukhari, the Polisario's representative to the international organization, said: "There are two suggestions on the table and the two sides will deal with them."</seg>
<seg id="7"> "There is no room for more recommendations or observations that might create problems instead of helping the process."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Third Republican Senator Joins List of those Criticizing Bush's Policy in Iraq</seg>
<seg id="2"> Domenici asked for a new strategy and put the blame of failure on the Iraqi government.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A prominent Republican senator joined the ranks of the critics of the American President George Bush's policy in Iraq calling for a new strategy a few days before a new confrontation in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The New Mexico Senator, Pete Domenici, who has been a member of the Senate for three decades and who is a candidate in the 2008 elections, is the third official Republican in ten days to critically oppose the policy of increasing the number of American troops in Iraq adopted by the American president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Domenici said in a press conference in Albuquerque in New Mexico the day before yesterday: "I do not support continuing with the current strategy," blaming the Iraqi government for not making enough achievements that merit the sacrifice of American soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He was quoted by the Agence France Press as saying: "I do not support the immediate withdrawal from Iraq or the reduction in funding our forces."</seg>
<seg id="7"> But he added: "I support a new strategy that transfers our soldiers from the fighting operations and puts them on the path to going home."</seg>
<seg id="8"> He explained that "The Iraqi government is the one that is failing in achieving even small progress to help Iraq or to merit the sacrifices made by our male and female soldiers."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The senator pointed to his support of a project that was proposed before the Senate and called for applying the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group released last year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> This group recommended a policy that aims at withdrawing the largest part of the American forces fighting in Iraq by March 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It added that some of the American forces should stay in Iraq to train the new Iraqi army, protect American installations, and conduct quick intervention missions against the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Bush said on Tuesday that the strategy that focuses on sending 30,000 additional troops to Iraq, which has reached its peak now, should be given a chance to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Bush said: "If we leave Iraq before completing the mission, the terrorists  will not announce their victory and will not put their weapons down."</seg>
<seg id="14"> And Bush added:" They will follow us here to our homes.</seg>
<seg id="15"> No matter how difficult the fight is in Iraq we have to win."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Last week, the very prominent Senator Richard Lugar caused a shock in Washington political circles when he said before the Senate that the policy of sending more troops doesn't have a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Republican George Voinovich also recommended the withdrawal from Iraq.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Domenici's statements came a few days after the Senate's return to Washington after a week-long recess, while the Democrats, who dominate Congress, were getting ready to unleash a new attack on Bush's policy in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="19"> A number of top Democrats in the Senate and the House commented on Domenici's statements.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The Leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said that the question is whether the Republications that oppose Bush will "join the vote to change the course of Iraq and bring the troops home?"</seg>
<seg id="21"> And she added: "How long will we wait to respect the wishes of Americans to end this war?"</seg>
<seg id="22"> The leader of the democratic majority at the Senate, Harry Reid, said:   "Senator Domenici is right in regarding the strategy of the American Administration in this war as wrong."</seg>
<seg id="23"> And he added: "We will not see the necessary change in the current course in Iraq, unless members of the Senate like Domenici, Lugar and Voinovich stand up to the American president and his stubbornness to hold on to this failed policy."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The American president's envoy for Sudan, Andrew Natsios, started his visit to the country with a field tour in the troubled Darfur region. The visit of the American envoy, the second of its kind since he was appointed in the beginning of this year, comes only a few days after a personal attack by the Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir that he is hampering the peace process in Darfur and "inciting rebels in the region against the peace efforts.  This came after a one-day visit by two envoys from the African Union and the United Nations over the status of the road map to resume the peace negotiations between the Sudanese government and Darfur gunmen who reject the fragile Abuja agreement."</seg>
<seg id="3"> Informed sources in Khartoum said that the seven-day visit of the United States' envoy to Sudan aims to halt the developing situation and get the comprehensive peace process in the south and the Abuja peace agreement in Darfur back on track.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Natsios's negotiations include a number of officials in the country, beginning with the First Vice President, Lieutenant General Salva Kiir Miyardeit, Vice President Ali Osman Mohammad Taha, the head of the president's leading assistants, Minni Arko Minawi, and Dr. Lam Akol Ajawin, the Sudanese Foreign Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He will visit the south of Sudan after this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Meanwhile, Sudan's permanent envoy to the United Nations, Abdul Mahmood Abdul Halim, said that there are closed negotiations among the permanent members of the Security Council regarding elements of the draft resolution on the hybrid operation in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He expects that the negotiations will extend during the current week to the experts and the rest of the member states at the council and then later on a security council's session will be set to officially discuss the draft and adopt the hybrid operation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abdul Halim said that the current month of July and the coming August will focus on developments in the Darfur case; it is expected that the Security Council will issue a resolution about delegating and financing the hybrid operation. Also, the pace of a peaceful solution to the situation will increase. He referred to the current visit to the country by Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim, the envoys of the United Nations and the African Union for peace in Sudan.  This will be followed by a conference in Tripoli about Darfur from the middle of this month until August during which the political negotiations with those who reject the Abuja Agreement will begin, according to what was determined in the road map.</seg>
<seg id="9"> And he pointed out to the beginning of the implementation of a previous agreement represented by the arrival of the leader of the new African forces and the envoy shared between the United Nations and the African Union for Khartoum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The envoy said that the Sudanese Commission in New York is taking part in the negotiations to guarantee that the draft resolution about the hybrid operation corresponds to the previous standards and references.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Abdul Mahmood explained that the Security Council will conduct a session next Thursday to listen to a report on its members' visit to a number of African countries, including Sudan.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With the arrival of the tenth anniversary of the end of the British rule in Hong Kong and the return of this island to China after 150 years, the entertainment city "Disneyland Hong Kong," which is suffering decreasing revenues, opened, a promotional exhibition in the city of Guangzhou in South China yesterday, Tuesday, in an attempt to attract more Chinese visitors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This might be a very important economic move, especially with the Chinese economic opening to the world and the implementation of a market economy, which has produced a large number of rich people, whose numbers are starting to compete with the countries of the Western world.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It is noted that the exhibition, built by the city with an investment of almost 3 million dollars, uses multimedia displays to show many entertainment elements in the city and copies of its contents. It is the first display of its kind in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5"> And as part of the promotional campaign itself, Disneyland Hong Kong distributed 270 digital video discs (DVDs) in different parts of China, as mentioned by the German News Agency, to encourage more Chinese, especially in the southern regions, to visit it in Hong Kong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Some reports say that there are more than 100 million Chinese who are doing well financially allowing them to pursue tourism abroad, and with this Hong Kong is not the only one that will benefit from this tourist flow.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is noted that Disneyland Hong Kong opened its doors to the public in September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It did not announce any data on the number of visitors since it admitted its failure in reaching the desired number of 5.6 million visitors in the first year.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Moroccan Monarch, King Mohammad the Sixth, renewed his support to French President Nicholas Sarkozy's project that calls for establishing a federation for the countries of the Mediterranean littoral.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In a congratulatory letter that he sent to Sarkozy on the occasion of France's Bastille Day that falls on July 14th, King Mohammad the Sixth described the Mediterranean project as creative because it addresses the visions of the people of the region and contributes to raising the real challenges put in front of it, according to the royal letter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Morocco's king commended the "ambitious" reforms that are being done by the new French president with determination and firmness and his well-known initiative with a piercing vision in order to continue shedding light on France and improving its international position.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Moroccan monarch expressed his happiness over the upcoming state visit by Sarkozy that will happen tentatively in October, saying: "This constitutes another reason to celebrate the Moroccan-French friendship and deepen the joint work so that the values of peace, democracy, dialogue and understanding between cultures will triumph."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Sarkozy's visit was supposed to include Morocco, during his first visit to some of the Maghreb countries but he ended up in the end with a visit to Algeria and Tunis, after Morocco asked to postpone Sarkozy's visit because of the full agenda of the Moroccan monarch, who was present during Sarkosy's visit to Algeria in Waja City (east).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Rabat justified the postponement, saying that they want Sarkozy's official status in Morocco to have the feel of a state visit that is supposed to last for the longest time possible and that will also have expanded discussions and deep negotiations touching upon the bilateral relations in addition to the regional and international issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It seems that the French presidency was convinced by the Moroccan justification and rushed to deny the existence of any passing cloud in the skies of the relationship between Rabat and Paris, but that the French president promised to go back to the Maghreb countries and to stay there longer. His short visit to Algeria and Tunis were dictated by other commitments that were waiting for him in his country in order to prepare for the coming political entrance, in addition to commitments on the European level.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Failure to Apply "Fugitives' Agreement," Israel Denies Imminent Withdrawal from Palestinian Cities</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Palestinian Authority's efforts to end the pursuit of fugitives from Al Aqsa Brigades, the military wing of the Fatah movement, failed after Israel refused to halt the pursuit of 206 fugitives whom the authority asked to be included in the Israeli amnesty decision.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Israel justified its rejection by saying that the fugitives from the first list haven't handed over their weapons to the security apparatuses or haven't signed an agreement to stop the attacks on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Official security sourced told "Al Sharq Al Awsat" that Israel, basically, refuses to shop chasing 28 of the fugitives from the Brigades in the West Bank ; most of them are in Nablus and Jenin and are accused of contacting the Lebanese Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Israeli newspaper "Yediot Ahronoth" said that the head of the Shabak (internal security), Yuval Diskin met with the Palestinian Interior Minister, Abd Al Razaq Al Yehya and other security leaders in Ramallah more than once with the aim of finding an acceptable solution for fugitives.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Security sources confirmed to "Al Sharq Al Awsat" what happened, but they refused to discuss the details.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Informed sources at Al Aqsa Brigades told "Al Sharq Al Awsat" that Israel proposed displacing the 28 wanted outside the Palestinian territories or gathering them in the cities of Ramallah and Jericho, which was rejected by the authority.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It seems that because of the current crisis Israel did not hand over to the authority a list due last Wednesday that would have had 120 wanted members on it, according to the Brigades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> An argument has broken out within the Al Aqsa Brigades about the decision to stop the attacks on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Leaders at the Brigades rejected the decision to stop the attacks that was announced by Zakaria Al Zoubaidi, the Head of the Brigades in Jenin.  They told "Al Sharq Al Awsat" that the decision was non-binding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a different context, spokesperson for the Israeli government, Miri Eisin, denied news reported by newspapers and news agencies quoting Palestinian officials that there will be an imminent Israeli withdrawal from the cities of Qalqiliyah and Jericho.</seg>
<seg id="12"> She said: "Not everything that the Palestinians ask for is done."</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yediot Ahronot's website recently quoted a Palestinian official as saying that the authority is discussing with Israel a plan to transfer the sovereignty over the Palestinian cities in three stages, starting with Qalqiliyah and Jericho then Ramallah and Bethlehem and ending with Tulkarm. According to the source, Nablus and Jenin were excluded.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, the Israeli army increased the number of its operations in the West Bank and arrested more than 25 Palestinians from different cities last night. This was on the night before the release of 256 Palestine prisoners who were supposed to be released together at 9 A.M. at Betonia checkpoint near Ramallah, according to the Israeli Prison Administration that is awaiting a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court regarding a petition to rescind the order to set the Palestinian prisoners free. This was in the context of the Israeli public prosecutor telling the court that this is a political and not a judicial decision and that the court has no jurisdiction.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Geneva - AFP: The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees expressed its sorrow for the deportation of 135 Iraqis by Turkey and returning them to their country, and warned that this move is considered a violation of international law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In a statement released in Geneva the day before yesterday, the Commission expressed "its great concern because it received information saying the Turkish authorities had expelled 135 Iraqis back to their country at the beginning of this week."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Taliban Gives Ultimatum and Threatens to Kill Koreans this Afternoon, Karzai Spokesperson Criticizes Taking of Hostages</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Kabul - Reuters: A spokesperson for the Taliban movement said yesterday that the leaders of the movement set one last ultimatum at 07:30 GMT today, Monday, regarding the Korean hostages and said that the movement will begin killing the hostages if their prisoners were not released by this time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taliban spokesperson Qari Mohammad Yousuf said that the council of the Taliban leadership headed by the leader of the movement Mullah Mohammad Omar has set this ultimatum which gives more weight to the threat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The kidnappers killed the leader of the Korean group last Wednesday but a number of ultimatums set by the Taliban have passed and the rebels have not execute their threat to kill the hostages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Yousuf told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location: "Since the talks between us, Kabul and the Korean government reached a dead end and they were not being honest... we will start killing the hostages unless they start releasing our prisoners by 12 o'clock tomorrow."</seg>
<seg id="6"> The separate talks between Afghani diplomats and Korean officials on one side and Taliban rebels on the other side reached a dead end each time because of the Taliban's demand that Kabul's government exchange the prisoners for the Korean hostages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> After he was subjected to huge criticism for releasing five Taliban prisoners in return for releasing an Italian hostage last March, Afghani President Hamid Karzai doubted beforehand that an agreement with the Taliban could be reached.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> And in his first comment on the latest hostage situation, Karzai condemned the kidnapping and did not talk about the possibility of making any deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A spokesman was quoted as saying: "Seizing hostages and harming the foreign guests especially women are actions in contradiction with the Islamic and Afghani culture and committing these shameful deeds on our land constitutes complete disdain of our Islamic and Afghani values."</seg>
<seg id="10"> An Afghani minister said on Saturday that force might be used if the negotiations failed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Vatican described the kidnapping operation as "as a huge violation to human dignity that contradicts all the fundamental standards for respect and rights and highly insults divine law."</seg>
<seg id="12"> There are 18 women among the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yousuf said that some of hostages detained in small groups in different places were sick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Governor of Ghazni province, Marajuddin Pathan said that the medicine that the Korean government wanted to send to the hostages could not be delivered on Saturday because the Afghani team could not communicate with the Taliban.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> He added that government doesn't want to use force to rescue the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="16"> He told Reuters that we do not have a plan for attack.</seg>
<seg id="17"> We are trying to send the delegation to conduct more negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the Afghani forces there are also foreign forces that are headquartered in Ghazni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Baek Jong Chun, special envoy for South Korea met yesterday with Karzai to discuss means of ending the hostage crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The Taliban are still holding one German and four of his Afghani colleagues that they kidnapped from a nearby region one day before kidnapping the Koreans.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Another German who was kidnapped with him was found dead later with evidence of gun shots on his body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The South Koreans are the largest group of foreigners who have been kidnapped by the Taliban since they were removed from power by forces led by the United Stated and Afghani forces in 2001.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> This kidnapping comes amidst an increase of violence during the past 18 months and it is one of the most bloody periods since the toppling of the Taliban.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Dubai 7-11-2007 (AFP) - The head of the "Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb countries" on Tuesday criticized the efforts to improve the relations between Algeria and France and called on France to "confess all of its crimes committed against the Muslims in Algeria."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The organization's Emir, Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, specifically criticized, in a statement that was published today online, the efforts that aim - according to him - to sign a friendship agreement between France and its previous colony, Algeria.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The statement, that coincided with French President Nicholas Sarkozy's visit on Tuesday to Algeria, said: "There is still a wall of separation, made from skulls and body parts and a raging sea of tears and blood between France and the Muslims," adding that "The correct Muslim religion refuses the expression of friendship with the infidels," as he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> France colonized Algeria in 1830 and continued occupying it until the independence of Algeria in 1962 after the liberation war in which more than one million martyrs died.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Abdul Wadud continued his statement saying that "The history of France in Algeria since 1830 until now is all crimes, injustice, domination, tyranny, genocide, killing, deportation, and displacement.  Anyone who follows the history for two full centuries will not find anything that merits forming even superficial relationships with France, not alone to find anything that justifies a friendship with it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Sarkozy said that he will again visit Algeria in November in a state visit being organized by the two countries that will yield "tangible results."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The signing of the friendship agreement between the two countries clashed with France's refusal of Algeria's request to confess the "crimes" of the occupation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The French president repeated many times his rejection that his country expresses regret over the colonial past and that the children should be burdened with the actions of their grandparents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Abdul Wadud asked France, specifically, to "confess all of its crimes committed against the Muslims in Algeria and confession is as the saying goes the first steps to reconciliation", pointing out to "Germany's confession of what it did to the Jews."</seg>
<seg id="11"> "So what prevents France from confessing like when Germany confessed?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> And he concluded his statement in a language that is not lacking any threats and said that "if Sarkozy persists in his old delusion and continues to insist that the children can not apologize for what the children did, then he should not expect the children in Algeria to remain silent about what was done to the parents."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He also asked France to stop meddling in Algeria's affairs and to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and Lebanon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Ottawa 7-23-2007 (AFP)- Canada announced on Monday that it will resume its direct aid to the Palestinian government after it was halted in 2006 following the formation of the Palestinian government by Hamas after its victory in the legislative elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Canadian Foreign Minister Peter MacKay said in a statement: "Because of the new Palestinian government's promise to abandon violence, recognize Israel, and commit to the previously signed agreements, and because there are chances to move the peace process, Canada will provide assistance to the new Palestinian government."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The minister added that Ottawa "is comfortable with the sense of responsibility that the (Palestinian) President (Mahmoud) Abbas and the Prime Minister (Salam) Fayyad showed in forming a government with which Canada and the international community can work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Canada was the fist country to announce suspending its direct assistance to the Palestinian government in 2006 after Hamas' triumph in the legislative elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ottawa announced on Monday it was issuing an amount of eight million  Canadian dollars (6.7 million American dollars) as a direct assistance to the new government based on a new temporary international mechanism that was approved by the Quartet Committee.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Washington 7-30-2007 (AFP) - General David Petraeus, the Commander of the American forces in Iraq, said on Monday during an interview with the American TV network ABC News that "he doesn't believe" that the British are currently getting ready to withdraw their forces from Iraq,.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> And while the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is conducting talks with the American President George Bush in Camp David (Maryland, East), news reports mentioned a plan to withdraw the 5,500 British soldiers from Iraq, but Brown's spokesperson denied these reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> General Petraeus said from Baghdad: "I do not think there is a plan.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There is a plan to withdraw gradually."</seg>
<seg id="6"> And they started, in reality, during the past few months to move some of the installations to the Iraqi security forces in Al Basra (south) and they intend to continue to do so in the coming months.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="7"> In return, he confirmed that the American forces will stay in Iraq until the summer of 2009 to allow a permanent security in Iraq to be achieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="9"> Replying to a question about the weapons contracts that amount to no less than 20 billion dollars with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and five other countries in the Gulf and the possibility of Saudi fighters in Iraq, the American general said: "In fact, I'm not sure they come from Saudi."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Washington 8-1-2007 (AFP) - Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday said that the strategy of increasing the troops in Iraq has led to improving security in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Replying to a question by the American TV station, CNN, Cheney also defended the choice of the Iraqi deputies to go on vacation for one month and he said: "This choice is better than the two months they were planning at first," while pointing out that the United States is "anxious" to see them perform their task fully.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Last month, a preliminary report to the White House about the effect of the new strategy noted that the progress achieved by the Iraqi Parliament is insufficient in regards to the necessary reforms, especially adopting the law about sharing oil revenues, which might increase the tensions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the American vice president indicated that the report about the effect of the new strategy expected to be released in September will show "achieving significant progress" towards the goals that were defined by the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As for the report of the commander of the American forces, General David Petraeus and the American Ambassador Ryan Crocker, Cheney said: "I think it will reveal that we have achieved significant progress."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He clarified that "The information I receive from people I respect indicate that Petraeus' plan is truly on its way to achieving results."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> After he renewed his confirmation that the decision to invade Iraq in March 2003 was right, Cheney concluded by saying: "We (himself and President George Bush) will end our term before January 20, 2009 and I think that we will be able to leave with our heads high because we did all that is good for our country."</seg>

<seg id="3"> The Al Qaeda organization showed a video tape last night that included the events of the clashes with the Algerian security forces in one of the mountains of Tizi Ouzou, which led to the terrorist explosion that resulted in the death of seven soldiers and the burning of police cars during the terrorist explosion. A bomb had been planted on the main route used for intermittent security convoys</seg>
<seg id="4"> A number of members of the terrorist groups belonging to Al Qaeda appeared in this tape while they were chasing the soldiers of the security forces who ran away from the cars when the explosion happened, in addition to scenes of clashes between the two sides.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> From his part, Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, Al Qaeda's Emir in the Islamic Maghreb, threatened to do a series of attacks and terrorist acts against the Algerian interests and companies in a number of Algerian areas, pointing out that this comes within Al Qaeda's approach to expand its operations during the coming period.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> London - New agencies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, stressed  -in an article published yesterday by the popular newspaper 'News of the World' - on the firmness of his country's relationship with the United States, denying what was said about a slight change in the relationship between London and Washington since Prime Minster Gordon Brown assumed his position. Miliband explained that America is the number one ally for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Miliband wrote that with Brown's new government some are trying to find evidence for a degeneration of our alliance with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He added that there is no and will not be any degeneration, and that nothing will change.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He continued saying that our relationship with the United States is the strongest, compared with our other bilateral relationships, and we are stronger together than if we were separated, and that the values we share give us real power.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Miliband spoke elsewhere about the participation in the sacrifice at the level of other efforts, like climate change, poverty in Africa and terrorism, and they are challenges that cannot be confronted without the United States, as he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The new Secretary of State for Commerce and International Development, Douglas Alexander, stressed in Washington last Thursday the benefits of a multilateral policy, which was explained as a slight change in the British foreign policy.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> Meanwhile, a new survey published in the British newspaper 'Daily Telegraph' revealed that the Labor Party - and after only two weeks since Gordon Brown took over the presidency - is advancing over the opposing Conservative Party, and the survey revealed that 40% of the British support the Labor Party compared to 33% supporting the Conservatives.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> If the Al Qaeda organization, which executes the majority of the terrorist operations in the world, is fighting Israel, as the press statement of Al Qaeda literally says .. then why has Al Qaeda not carried out any terrorist operation against Israel?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A question that might seem strange but in my opinion is a correct and logical question, because if the Al Qaeda organization justifies its terrorist attacks in the Arab and Muslim countries under the pretext that these regimes  are dealing with Israel and are accepting to walk on the peace of path with the Jewish state.. then why Al Qaeda won't shorten the way and move to attack Israel, since it is the foe and the enemy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although some who raise this question try to imply that this is an example of Israel's involvement in these operations, no one can provide decisive proof for that. As a result, these implications will remain as only doubts and assumptions that do not reach the level of a direct accusation against Israel even if the content of these implications don't disavow that "Al Qaeda" might be an internal collaborator, with or without its knowledge!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The truth is that whoever analyzes the content of the top Israeli newspapers, from opinions to analysis, will see clearly that the Israeli sources that have a close link with the ruling circles in Israel say in all determination and confidence that Israel is not within the target circle of the Al Qaeda organization.. and this matter raises many questions about the source of confidence among Israelis about not being targeted by Al Qaeda!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If these Israeli sources tried to cover this by saying that the Al Qaeda organization targets the Christian world, then this repugnant saying not only aims at removing the suspicion from Israel but also aims at causing a rift between Islam and Christianity under the umbrella of the false lie that is being promoted by the western media circles, which have a close relationship with Israel, and that portray the Al Qaeda organization as the main label for the Arab and Muslim world!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The undeniable truth is that the Israeli violence and gross injustice being imposed on the Palestinians as a result of its aggressive policy constitutes the best climate to facilitate the opportunity for the Al Qaeda organization to work freely and recruit new generations of extremists under the weight of this oppression!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In return, all the terrorist operations executed by the Al Qaeda organization provide a grand service to Israel by linking resistance with terrorism from one angle and justifying all forms of aggression and the excessive use of force in the name of self-defense from another!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And frankly, and without beating around the bush, those who delay the international conference to combat terrorism are not far from the questions and the assumptions and doubts expressed both publicly and privately, but without any conclusive proof as yet. However, this proof may appear tomorrow amidst new international standards and balances of power that will not allow double standards. They will be like detailed court briefs, filled with all the evidence to support the accusation, waiting for an honest judge to finally put an end to this ugly phenomenon known as terrorism!</seg>

<seg id="2"> When the state lies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The storm that was unleashed over the sale of the Bank of Cairo has not calmed down, even after the central bank's governor admitted that that bank had reached a critical stage such that one couldn't be silent about and which resulted in the deterioration of its performance and the bank was no longer able to handle an additional bill to solve its problems.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The state's budget, that actually suffers from a major deficit - was not able to provide 20 billion Egyptian pounds to pay off its debts and fill the deficit in its allocations.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Then the government offered 80% of Bank of Cairo for sale to a main investor, after it realized -late- that the idea of a merger or a takeover did not constitute a successful approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> This is simply the image that was sent to the majority of the public opinion, for those who are not specialized in economy like myself. After a fierce argument about this case between those who understand and those who do not, and between those who defend the government whether it is right or wrong and those who criticize it based on reasonable political and economic pretexts .. the leading argument is that the sale of Egyptian banks to a foreign investor constitutes a danger to the national economy and opens a big door to foreign control of funding of development projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Whether the pretexts of each party were right and wrong, the government most likely is doing what it has in mind and will go ahead with selling the bank because it is more committed to a plan that calls for reforming the banking sector. This is based on agreements with international organizations to enable public opinion to see the details in the drawers of the policy committee, more than its commitment to the principles of transparency that it likes to talk about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But the main problem - in my opinion - is not the necessities that led to the sale of the Bank of Cairo, but the prevalent culture in the governmental administration that hides the truth and spins the negatives while it buries its head in the sand.. until it explodes all at once... It has been shown that the Bank of Cairo's problems were not born yesterday, but go back for six years. Succeeding governments did not care about revealing it and dealing with it. This begs the question about the political and legal responsibility of a number of prime ministers and former ministers, who, during their time, opened the bank treasuries to businessmen who ladled out loans without guarantees, and then skipped off abroad.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is probably one of the most important reasons that led to the problems of the Bank of Cairo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The political regime in Egypt doesn't recognize the concept of making officials politically accountable.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So there is no punishment for crimes of negligence and favoritism and tampering with public money.</seg>
<seg id="12"> And what happened in the banking sector that led one of the main Egyptian banks to be on the brink of bankruptcy, is being repeated in one way or another in different sectors.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Like the sudden shortage in water and the collapse of the railway facilities and the marine transportation and others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This is as a result of ignoring and spinning problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The responsibility of this deteriorating situation of the state's apparatus doesn't fall on the employees who lie with their managers' knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because the state lies and forges numbers and data.. They occur due to the lack of accountability and transparency at all levels, in spite of the numerous monitoring and accountability apparatuses.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Petroleum Minister, Engineer Sameh Fahmy checked on some of the new fields in the western desert and the new production facilities in the area and the Al Hamra specialized oil terminal. It is considered the main hub for crude oil produced in the western desert, where 185 barrels are being produced daily with production expected to reach 225 thousand barrels during the coming period.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The minister indicated that Al Hamra terminal includes all the necessary features to transform it into a main export hub through an advanced work system. The minister asked for a study to be prepared on developing Al Hamra oil terminal's facilities and the connected oil pipelines to increase its current export capacity of 60 thousand barrels a month to one million barrels a month and increase the storage capacity from 800 thousand barrels to one million barrels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> And during the inspection visit, Engineer Shamel Hamdy, the Head of the Western Desert Development Committee, reviewed a report on the development of production in the western desert and the status of production after putting some of the newly discovered fields on the production map one after the other. It will result in an increase of the production from the western desert to around 40,000 barrels a day so the total production of the area will reach around 270,000 barrels a day next April.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The visit included checking crude oil reception pipelines at the terminal consisting of three main pipelines. He also checked on the facilities to receive and ship crude oil through land pipelines and warehouses and shipping station pumps.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The minister also checked on the alternate integrated center for combating oil sea pollution, which includes new equipment for combating sea pollution and checked on the chemical laboratory at the terminal, equipped with the most modern technological equipment specializing in monitoring the quality of crude oil.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In Spite of Overwhelming Defeat of Ruling Party, Japanese Prime Minister Refuses to Resign and Decides to Make Ministerial Adjustment</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tokyo- News agencies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, confirmed yesterday that he will stay in his position in spite of the overwhelming defeat, the day before yesterday, of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which he leads, in the House of Councilors elections.  He said, we have to look at these results with extreme seriousness, and he promised to move ahead with the reforms to build the nation and encourage economic growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> It is worth nothing that Abe's coalition will not be removed from power as a result of the defeat in the House of Councilors elections because it occupies a strong majority in the larger House of Representatives that elects the prime minister. However, Abe said that he will make a ministerial adjustment in his government in attempts to regain the voters' trust.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He added that the people are asking for a comprehensive change in addition to changes among the leading posts in the party. Abe is facing pressures to resign from within his Liberal Democratic Party that has ruled Japan for the majority of the past 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Japanese newspaper Yomiuri quoted former Defense Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, as saying that Abe should resign and if he doesn't do so then the party will end soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But some analysts said that the current lack of a suitable successor for Abe in the party might help him to stay in power for some time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said that Abe has to dissolve the parliament quickly and succumb to the will of the people but Abe disregarded any dissolving of the parliament, or conducting early legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Although Abe refused to resign, the second man in his party resigned because of the tough defeat for the party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Liberal Democratic Party and its new coalition partner, the Komeito Party, gained 46 seats in the House of Councilors elections, compared with 60 seats that were gained by the Democratic Party, which is the main opposition party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The ruling coalition needed 64 seats to keep a majority in the House of Councilors. The elections were for half of the council seats composed of 242 seats.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Abe's party got 37 seats; it was worse than its defeat in 1998 that obliged Ryutaro Hashimoto to resign from heading the government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Angry voters denied Abe's government the majority because of a series of scandals and because the government made mistakes in dealing with the pension records problem.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="3"> While they were trying to get in, the bodyguard prevented them fearing disorder and meddling inside, especially since they were in a state of extreme drunkenness.</seg>

<seg id="5"> Then they intentionally attacked two cars that were parked in front of the nightclub, causing major damage. Then they tried to take over a bus that was parked there and divert its direction but they failed because of the sudden and fast intervention of the members of the judicial police squad from the national security zone on the shores of Al Buhaira. They were successful in containing the situation and arresting three of the deviants while efforts are underway to arrest others who managed to escape.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Iran Studies ElBaradei's Suggestion to Stop Enrichment Expansion</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tehran witnessed yesterday diplomatic activity on two fronts. The first was the visit of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Iran to discuss  developments in the bilateral, regional and international relations. The second is the Islamic Republic's announcement that it is studying the suggestion of "a time-out" that mandates stopping the expansion of its uranium enrichment program while it waits to receive the international inspectors between the 11th and the 13th of this month.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Chavez started talks with his Iranian counterpart Mahmud Ahmadinejad, in his third visit to Iran and the last stop of his tour that took him to Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Venezuelan president's visit comes as a reply to the European tour of his American enemy, George Bush. He wants to provoke the White House with a visit to a country that has tense relations with Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> During the visit, Chavez who supports Iran's nuclear program ridiculed rumors about a Venezuelan "atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="7"> He added: "It seems I will sign an agreement to make an atomic bomb," adding: "We do not need an atomic bomb because we have it, it is called the Venezuelan people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Chavez arrived on Saturday evening to Tehran, heading a delegation that includes ministers of energy, finance, and communications. He is expected to visit today with Ahmadinejad the Assaluyeh region known for energy production in the Gulf to inaugurate a petrochemical plant.</seg>
<seg id="9"> A number of contracts will be signed during this visit; one of them is to build 7,000 homes and a petrochemical unit in Venezuela.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mohammad Ali Husseini said that Latin America which Nejad visited last January is a "region that has good prospects to improve our relations."</seg>
<seg id="11"> President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega visited Tehran on June 10.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Venezuelan Ambassador to Iran, Arturo Anibal Gallegos said the visit's "goal is to develop the bilateral cooperation in the economic, industrial and political areas."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> With regard to the nuclear issue, Husseini said that his country is studying the suggestion of "a time-out" that mandates stopping its uranium enrichment program in return of halting the pursuit of imposing more sanctions on it from the United Nations. However, he stressed that "halting the enrichment is not likely. Meanwhile, a diplomat in Vienna said that the international powers are discussing proposing this idea to Iran to end the nuclear crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei proposed this idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Husseini said: "The (suggestion) doesn't include anything new since it has been discussed in the past."</seg>
<seg id="16"> But Iran is still "studying it" adding that "Tehran is ready to study all the plans and suggestions that guarantee its rights in the negotiation process."</seg>
<seg id="17"> He added that the top Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani and the Higher Representative for the Foreign Policy of the European Union Javier Solana discussed the suggestion during talks to discuss the nuclear disagreement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for National Security and Foreign Policy Alaa Al-Din Boroujerdi said that the idea of "a time-out" is not an appropriate solution either.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This coincided with the efforts of American President George Bush p to get support from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to impose wider sanctions on Iran, during their talks in the American State of Main.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, the newspaper Haaretz said that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert finally made Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor Liberman responsible for the issue of thwarting Iran's nuclear program. This came during discussions that included the participation of Mosad Chief Meir Dagan, President of the Israeli Nuclear Committee Gideon Frank, President of National Security Council Ilan Mizrahi, Shabak Security Chief Yuval Diskin, and senior officials at the foreign and defense ministries and the Israeli army, especially the military intelligence unit.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Yemen: A Suicide Bomber at Queen Balqis Temple ... Arabic</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih said yesterday that the primary investigation in the suicide attack that targeted a Spanish tourist convoy in the Marib province on Monday and resulted in the death of seven of them and two Yemeni drivers and injuring others, indicate that the attacker was not Yemeni but had an Arab nationality.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He promised to reveal the details soon after finishing the examination of the DNA of the suicide bomber.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The first official accusations that the "Al Qaeda" organization in Yemen was behind the attack indicated a possibility that the person who committed the attack against the "Queen Balqis Temple" was Yemeni. And he might be one of the 23 who escaped from the political prison apparatus (intelligence) last year after the organization announced appointing one of them, Naser Al Wahishi (Abu Bseir) as its new leader and after the distribution of an audio recording of Qasem Al Rimi (Abu Huraira), who is on the list of fugitives and the wanted list, in which he threatened to launch attacks that he described as "Jihadist against the crusaders and their helpers in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="7"> "Abu Huraira" denied any negotiation with the Yemeni government and said that he was nominated by "Abu Bseir" to do the audio recording.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Yemeni president described the attack on the tourists in Marib as "criminal, terrorist, cowardly and dirty," promising the most severe punishment for the Al Qaeda elements.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said: "We will chase them wherever they are and wherever they go or hide and we will impose fierce punishment because of the crimes they committed against innocent tourists and their Yemeni companions and against the nation, its interests, its security and stability."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Ali Saleh announced a reward worth 15 million Yemeni Riyals (75,000 US dollars) to anyone who gives information that will lead to the arrest of the terrorist elements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With the arrival of a Spanish plane carrying the Spanish Tourism Minister and the families of the victims to Sana in order to send the bodies of the Spanish victims to their country, the investigation authorities started to examine the DNA of the suicide bomber to determine his identity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The attack was executed by a suicide bomber in a 1982 "Toyota Jeep.".</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yemeni authorities took further measures and implemented high security procedures for embassies, hotels and foreign establishments all across the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Yemeni government circles considered the terrorist attack a hurtful blow against tourists after receiving information about the cancellation by European and foreign tourism companies of the reservations of thousands of tourists taking part in tourism trips this summer.</seg>
<seg id="15"> He said that the Yemeni economy "will be negatively affected and lose large tourism revenues."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In addition to that, the Yemeni parliamentary council highly criticized the government and accused the security apparatuses of negligence and of ignoring the threats that were recently released by the members of "Al Qaeda" about "terrorist" attacks that are imminent and hurtful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The council, which issued a statement condemning the attack and saying that the Muslim religion is not guilty for these "terrorist" elements, summoned  Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Dr. Rashad Al Alimi so as to stand next Sunday before members of the parliament and answer their questions about negligence.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Thousands of Palestinians Still Stranded on Egyptian Borders</seg>
<seg id="2"> Defunct Palestinian Government and Other Factions Refuse Opening of Kerem Abu Salem Crossing Instead of Rafah Crossing</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The opposing Palestinian voices have increased regarding the entry of some thousands of Palestinians stranded in Egypt on their way to the Gaza Strip through the crossing of Kerem Abu Salem, or "Kerem Shalom" as Israeli calls it, which is located where the Palestinian, Egyptian and Israeli borders meet, southeast of Rafah city, south of the Strip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The defunct national unity government and other resistance factions expressed their absolute refusal of "replacing the Rafah border crossing with the Kerem Shalom crossing as a passage and exit for the Palestinians to the world."</seg>
<seg id="5"> The factions showed their refusal through the firing of bursts of mortar shells by its military wings on the crossing designated for the entry of products to the Strip and not for the movement of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> These positions came after the announcement of an Egyptian-Israeli agreement to open "Kerem Shalom" on Wednesday for one day for the purpose of letting in 4,000 Palestinians stranded in Egyptian cities like Rafah, Al Arish and Cairo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> These Palestinians, including around 600 sick people, did not have a way out because the Israeli occupation authorities refused to open the crossing for a month to allow the Palestinians to return to the Strip or leave it freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Israel allowed for the opening of this crossing for two consecutive days on the sixth and the seventh of last month. Up until now it refuses to reopen it, especially after the "Hamas" movement tightened its fierce fist on the Gaza Strip on the 14th of last month.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Israel closed the Rafah border crossing permanently for the first time following the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in a commando operation executed by fighters from the "Hamas" movement and committees of the people's resistance and "The Islamic army" in an Israeli military location near the area of Kerem Shalom on June 25, 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Since then, Israel has allowed the opening of the Rafah crossing for an average of four to six days a month over four weeks. In other instances, the closure lasted for a whole month or more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The defunct government demanded in a statement released yesterday the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of travelers "so that the Strip won't become a big prison."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The government expressed its complete refusal of "all the Israeli attempts aiming to move the Rafah border crossing (...) to the Kerem Abu Salem region so that the Egyptian-Palestinian borders are clear of intervention or external mandate."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The "Hamas" movement, "The Popular Front for Liberating Palestine," "The Islamic group" movement, the committees of the people's resistance and the Brigades of Martyr Ahmad Abu Al Rish joined the government in their refusal to let in the stranded individuals through the Kerem Shalom crossing. It also asked for reactivating the Rafah border crossing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> A number of activists, including tens of injured one are worried about the return through the crossing of Kerem Shalom that is being completely controlled by Israel for fear of being arrested by the occupation soldiers who control all the operational details at the crossing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Israel created the "Karem Shalom" crossing pursuant to a protocol to activate the border crossing in the Gaza Strip, known as the "Rice Agreement," that was agreed upon on  November 15 2005 after the Israeli withdrawal from the Strip on September 12 of the same year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The protocol says that the Rafah border should be designated for the movement of Palestinians and diplomats and others, in addition to the exports of goods from the Strip, and be under a Palestinian-Egyptian control and be monitored by a commission of European observers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It also stated that the products should be brought in through the "Kerem Shalom" border for approximately one million and half Palestinians living on a coastal strip that doesn't exceed 365 square kilometers.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> President of the Kurdistan regional government Nijervan Barzani admitted the existence of cases of violations of detainees rights in the Kurdish prisons, while the Islamic Group in Kurdistan talked about the decision of the regional government to prevent holding a meeting in Jamjamal mosque.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> He said in a press conference: "I can't say whether what the Human Rights Watch Report contains is right or not. In reality there are violations and we, in the Kurdistan regional government, put new reforms in the prisons and we cooperated and opened the prisons' doors to the organization at a time when many governments refuse entry inside its prisons. This is a good indication that we are determined to conduct radical reforms in these prisons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He added: "We asked the concerned parties and prison officials to conduct an investigation of what the report contained and I personally was one of those who called for publishing the report and announcing it in all transparency."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Minister of Human Rights of the Kurdish government Mohammad Aziz said the report released by the American organization "Human Rights Watch" about the situation in the prisons in the region is "exaggerated." He explained that it covered the period between last April and October 2006, and that is the period during which the process of unifying the administration of the two regions was not yet completed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He pointed out that "The ministry agreed with some of what was mentioned in the report," saying "it neglected the positive things that recently happened in the region with regard to the improvement of the situations in the prisons in addition to the release of 400 people as a result of applying the general amnesty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Kurdish government denies the existence of violations of the rights of the detainees and the prisoners in Kurdistan at a time when the Arab parties are asking about the fate of 250 detainees who were transferred secretly from Kirkuk to the Kurdish prisons in Akra, Irbil and al-Sulaimaniyah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On the other hand, the Ministry of Religious and Kurdish Affairs issued a decision that prevents any political activity or a party from gathering inside the region's mosques and emphasized the importance of keeping the mosques as "places for worship and not for political activity." It also warned that it will enforce strict measures against any party that wants to use mosques and places of worships for the party's purposes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to a statement by the ministry: "The Islamic Group asked for a permit to conduct a meeting inside the great Jamjamal mosque but the ministry refused. In spite of that, the group challenged the ministry and conducted these meetings headed by its emir. As a result, the ministry of religious affairs warns the political parties of using mosques that are places for worship and utilizing them for political and party purposes. The ministry will also take all the legal measures against whoever violates its decisions."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One is, especially when visiting Japan for the first time, confused by how to get introduced to this country located thousands of miles away and which occupied our imagination with its economic progress, and especially its technological achievements, and surviving a disaster, which was the ugliest faced by any nation in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What is the secret for this success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How did Japan manage to overcome the disaster of the destruction that came upon it after the Second World War, and eradicate the effects of the United States' bombing of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with two nuclear bombs, and rebuild what was destroyed by the war?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How did it overcome the feelings of hate towards its previous bitter enemy, the United States, to become its best ally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Japan witnessed in the last few years, and is sill witnessing, major shifts, the most prominent of which is an obvious leaning towards leaving the state of "isolation" and becoming more involved in international activities. This can be seen in amending the "peaceful" constitution to allow for the deployment of Japanese forces abroad, and announcing more amendments and requesting a permanent seat in the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="7"> What is the secret behind this cautious enthusiasm and timid ambition?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> How does Japan look at the Middle East region and the neighboring countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Japan's relations with its neighbors, especially North Korea and China, are relationships of love and hate.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Japan, which is a group of islands that extend between the Pacific Ocean and the Japanese Sea, thinks that it is a victim of geography and history.</seg>
<seg id="11"> North Korea with its ballistic missiles and nuclear program on one side, and China with the doubling of its military spending on the other side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Japanese people are quiet by nature. You can hardly hear their voice, and you see them focusing on work tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The concern that some politicians show towards the policies of the neighbors, North Korea and China, doesn't impact the ordinary citizen, who as all the citizens of the developed world, gives higher priority to domestic issues in his life.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Corruption, high prices, unemployment, and health insurance preoccupy the Japanese individual more than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Although Japan will witness parliamentary elections at the end of this month, citizens seem to be busy with domestic issues, the most prominent of which is the scandal of the loss of the pension records.</seg>

<seg id="10"> The ability of President George Bush to snitch successes out of his adventures is becoming slim.</seg>
<seg id="11"> His ability to resist the calls for a scheduled withdrawal is diminishing.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Withdrawal means leaving the region to face the Iraqi ball of fire and its consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If Iran was the biggest winner from the American invasion of Iraq, then Turkey came out as a loser.</seg>
<seg id="14"> There is a flagrant imbalance in the Turkish-Iraqi-Iranian triangle.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The problem of Turkey in Iraq can't be summarized in the fortification of the fighters of the Labor Kurdish Party in the mountainous areas and their unleashing of attacks from there.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The most difficult problem is the establishment of a quasi country in Iraqi Kurdistan whose relative stability will revive the dreams of the Kurds scattered around the neighboring countries, especially Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Invading Iraqis Kurdistan is no longer an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Giving this task to the army has its price in the internal tension between Erdogan's party with its Islamic roots and the guards of the secular inheritance, on top of whom is the military establishment.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This invasion has its price also in the relations between Turkey and the European Union that Turkey tries to sneak into.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> There is another challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21"> What would Turkey do in case of a full attack by Iran to snatch the leadership of the region and sneak into the club of nuclear countries?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Will the Atlantic umbrella be considered a sufficient deterrent or does it also need the nuclear cushion to sleep peacefully?</seg>
<seg id="23"> Last October, I asked the Turkish prime minister in Istanbul about the response of his country if Iran were to conduct a nuclear experiment.</seg>
<seg id="24"> He answered with a smile: "This is a military question."</seg>
<seg id="25"> I repeated the question, then he repeated the answer.</seg>
<seg id="26"> I heard in Istanbul that the army is discussing this issue and insists on keeping it away from the politicians and the media.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> We can also point to many files:</seg>
<seg id="28"> The Arab-Israeli conflict, the increasing presence of "Al Qaeda" in the region, the increase of the sectarian tension and the spread of a state of instability in more than one place.</seg>
<seg id="29"> We have to note here that Erdogan's government has made progress in preparing Turkey for a Middle Eastern role under the slogan of the search for stability.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It improved its relationship with Syria and Iran while keeping strong relationship with the moderate Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It kept the relationship with Israel and improved the one with the Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Turkey's participation in the "UNIFEL" forces in south Lebanon was noteworthy. Turkey's attempt to open the door to discussion between Turkey and Syria after attempts to lessen the conflict between Syria and Lebanon was also noteworthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The winner also has to deal with the European dream.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The start of negotiations with the European Union doesn't mean that the membership is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The measures that Erdogan's government took are still not enough according to the Union's standards.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The issue goes beyond the conditions for eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Europe is worried about immigration, unemployment and the lack of assimilation among the new comers, and also worried about its identity.</seg>
<seg id="38"> In Europe, there are voices that say Turkey is not European either culturally or geographically, and its inclusion threatens to change the identity of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Most probably, Turkey will be monitored for many years, after many Europeans realize the importance of its stability for many reasons, one of which is to be a safe passage for energy coming from the east to the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> On the domestic level, Erdogan can talk about the years of stability that Turkey witnessed during the era of his party.</seg>
<seg id="41"> He can depend on numbers.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The growth percentage was around 7% last year.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Foreign investments reached 20 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="44"> Inflation decreased 29% in the year 2002 to 9% in the year 2006.</seg>
<seg id="45"> The battle doesn't revolve only around numbers, since there were demonstrations by millions who support secularism revealing that there are worries among many Turks that the secular values of the Party of Justice and Development is only "a temporary program" hiding a secret agenda.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> In spite of all the reassurances that Erdogan gave, only few of the people did not accept the possibility of seeing Abdullah Gul occupying the seat of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk while his wife wears the veil.</seg>
<seg id="47"> We can say that this contention over the identity of the regime and the strict commitment to secular values are at the core of the electoral test today, especially after the latest warnings by the army that find it difficult to repeat its previous experience in "saving the country" from the civilian rule.</seg>
<seg id="48"> This is without forgetting the role of the Kurdish factor in the elections and in inciting fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> While the sectarian wind is blowing in the region all the way to Pakistan, Turks will head to the election ballots today to give the winner the burden of confronting challenges both domestically and abroad.</seg>
<seg id="50"> These elections concern the Turks and it also concerns anyone whose misfortune it was to be born in this unstable part of the world.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Yonhap" pointed to reports indicating that South Korea paid a financial ransom to release its citizens.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Governor of the Kunar province Shalizai Deedar said that the tribal leaders intervened to release Reuter who headed to Kunar to conduct an investigation on the death of 23 people in an air raid that was launched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) two weeks ago.</seg>

<seg id="10"> Police Chief Dar Ali Khatak said the missiles that were launched half an hour after midnight, destroyed four homes and injured seven policemen.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Solana said in an interview that will be published tomorrow, Tuesday, by the "Al-Anba" newspaper, that speaks for the Progressive Socialist Party in Lebanon, that he is happy about the formation of the international court in the case of the assassination of President Rafiq Al Hariri, "Although I hoped that it was formed after it had been agreed upon in Lebanon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Solana congratulated the international investigation committee and its President Serge Brammertz on "the high level of professionalism and secrecy in which it conducts its work".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He confirmed the commitment of the European Union to protect Lebanon's sovereignty and its independence and the unity of its land. He said that he is still committed to Lebanon being "free from outside interference and united in its pursuit of democracy," adding that "The Lebanese problem ideally is solved by a Lebanese solution but until this happens, all those who wish Lebanon well will continue to urge the external players to stop imposing their agendas, and do what they can to encourage dialogue."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Humanitarian and Custody Problem Imposes Enforcement of Lebanese Law on Foreign Family. Percentage of Readers 1.72%.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A social and humanitarian case involving a non-Lebanese family residing in Lebanon that lost its breadwinner and needed a legal solution in the territory where it resides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> She was blessed with two daughters from a Syrian husband who died some time after their births.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After the death, she obtained a custody ruling from the Armenian Orthodox Archdiocese in Lebanon over her two non-Lebanese minor daughters.</seg>
<seg id="5"> She requested from the Court of First Instance of Mount Lebanon, under the presidency of Judge John al-Qazzi and the membership of the two judges Alaa' al-Khatib and Naji al-Dahdah, to appoint her as trustee to manage the properties of her two non-Lebanese daughters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Upon receiving the request, the Court looked into the issue of how much jurisdiction the Lebanese courts have to rule on it, and the extent of applicability of Lebanese law to it given that all members of this family are non-Lebanese. It examined the international jurisdiction of local courts in accordance with the stipulations of the Rules of Civil Procedure Law which defines the conditions for international jurisdiction of Lebanese courts. One of the conditions applies to the petition filed before the local court with respect to the fact that the mother resides with her two daughters in Lebanon and that the request she submitted pertains to the property of the two minors in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on these legal facts which vest it with the jurisdiction, the court moved from adjudicating based on the form of the mother's request to examining it in principle and determining the law that must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In this context, the court reached an interpretation and said in its judgment "that the legislator resolved the conflict between laws via the so-called Rules of Conflict, which are national rules put forth by the legislator or the judge, but which, however, do not provide an immediate solution to the issue under question, and their role is limited to determining the law that must be applied as the most appropriate law to govern the relationship and the most relevant to it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It further said that "Lebanese law, like many foreign legislations and international treaties, relies on the person's nationality as the criterion of applicability in matters of personal status, and it imposes in this area the application of the petitioner's citizenship law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The court deemed this methodology to be a traditional methodology in handling problems arising from special international relations. However, the evolution of this type of international relations has led to the existence of other methodologies to the solution that are combined with the traditional methodology, including the methodology of immediately enforceable laws which exclude the application of the traditional methodology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> It explained that "the rules of immediate applicability apply equally to domestic and international legal relations regardless of any external factor because the matters they handle touch upon the social, ethical and political foundations of the country of the judge who is examining the conflict, since it becomes impossible for him not to enforce them. The rules provide the immediate solution for the issue in question and do not designate the foreign law that must apply, and consequently the immediate domestic legal rules must be applied."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> It addressed "the Lebanese sectarian system that has led to a multiplicity of Lebanese laws in the area of personal status, whereby each sect is subject to its own special law, as is the case with respect to Law 2/4/1951 which applies to all members of one of the sects, namely the Christian one,</seg>
<seg id="13"> and the statutes of guardianship rules and terms for the management of the properties of Christian minors." It addressed one of the issues at the core of Lebanese social foundations which mandate the provision of protection and care for the interests of this group on Lebanese soil, regardless of its nationalities.</seg>
<seg id="14"> According to this review, the law that must apply in guardianship petitions, pursuant to the petitioner's argument, is Lebanese law, and specifically Law 1951.</seg>

<seg id="3"> After a period of treatment in Paris, the activist of the Free Patriotic Movement Mark Howaik who was injured during the events of last January 23, returned to Beirut the night before last.</seg>
<seg id="4"> He was received at the airport by a representative of Deputy General Michael Aoun, Deputy Sharl Mozaya, Deputy Abbas Hashim, and the responsible for political communications in the Movement, Jubran Basil, Dr. Bassam al-Hashim, Howaik's family, and supporters from the Movement. He also received a call from Deputy Ibrahim Kana'an.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Deputy Hashim said: "The Movement is proud to receive his fighter who sacrificed for many young men."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Basil saw that "The great consolation for Mark was how surrounded he was through the big support for his case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the airport, Howaik moved along with the audience to Amsheet Hall. He was joined by Deputy Walid Khoury. Mozaya said: "Mark came to prove to those sitting in their palaces and retired in their houses; those who call for nationalism  but collaborate, and for the love of life but are soul grippers; those who preach freedom, sovereignty and independence but are followers; those who claim protecting the Christian community but are the ones who cancelled the great Friday; those who claim innocence but have records filled with crimes. He came to prove that he is the one who loves life and loves Lebanon without limits. You are the patriot by excellence and the honorable Lebanese. You are the one who confronted courageously the logic of dominance. You are the one who refused the return of militias to our areas and became a role model in the Free Patriotic Movement."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He added: "We are the owners of the national project. We want to live in a country that is free and independent, in a country that fights corruption,  those who cause it, the corrupt people and respect the formula of coexistence.</seg>
<seg id="9"> We want to live in a country that respects the right of the citizen and protects it. To achieve this, we need to elect a statesman to the presidency, not a thief or a collaborator or a murderer. We have to elect the man who represents the sweeping majority of Christians and the majority of Lebanese, a man of bravery and honor, a man of courage and justice."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Why don't we make the by-elections a new chapter in the course of democracy, instead of compromises and nominations?</seg>
<seg id="3"> General elections or by-elections revive the democratic game because it alone is the safety valve for the notion of state and institutions, and the witness to the vitality of Lebanese diversity.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Nominations, even if indicative of good intentions, do not sustain democracy. They abolish the citizens' choices and rights, and we cannot abolish the fundamental steps especially under the inopportune circumstances and the delicate situation. Irrespective of the considerations, there is no avoiding our progress in the sound exercise of democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> There are countries steeped in democracy, such as Belgium and Australia, which rely on compulsory voting because they consider voting not only a right but an obligation as well.</seg>
<seg id="6"> There are other deeply democratic countries that exhaust their people with elections dozens of times a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two months before the presidential elections, the best gift that the Lebanese people can offer themselves is the parliamentary by-elections, provided that the Lebanese engage in a competitive and civilized spirit confirming their maturity and their renouncing of the language of the street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A reminder of the benefits of elections is due, even if under these circumstances where verbal slinging is at its worst.</seg>
<seg id="9"> One of the most important benefits is finding out the real political weight of the political forces and movements, either in North Metn or in Beirut.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Parliamentary elections alone can show the real weight of this or that party, thus pre-empting the boastfulness of some, or the exaggeration or minimization of the importance of others, and on that basis each party can prepare for the general elections at some point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This democratic exercise in difficult and adverse circumstances will prove to the world that the Lebanese people are capable of stemming every conspiracy against their system, their characteristics and their freedoms, and are capable of victory over all terrorism from any source, particularly if its objective is to drive Lebanon into the club of dictatorial states or those states suffering from the chaos of internal divisions and external interventions.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The greatest fear is for Lebanon to become used to choosing without elections, such as happens in our surrounding world, after its people become convinced that elections are a danger to them.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The newspaper (the Observer) that was issued yesterday, Sunday, said that former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair launched a fierce attack against what he called the senseless British Muslims who, as he said, embraced a false feeling of injustice that they are being persecuted by Britain and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Blair who resigned from his position on June 27 warned that Britain is facing the danger of losing the war against the terrorists if mainstream society did not confront this threat.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The newspaper also referred to Blair's statements in which he also attacked the groups that defend civil liberties. His statement came during a documentary television program that Channel Four will broadcast on Monday. It was recorded last Tuesday on the eve of his departure from power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the program,  Blair is quoted as saying that the ideology they are promoting is that Muslims in Britain do not enjoy freedom of expression or freedom of religion, and the truth is that Muslims have in this country (Britain) more freedom than in the majority of Muslim countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Blair added that we are not fighting the battle adequately which makes it difficult for us to win. It is also because we do not stand in front of them and tell them that your ways are wrong and your ideas are also absurd and no one is persecuting you and your feeling of injustice is unjustified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Blair referred to the removal of the Taliban regime from power in Afghanistan, saying that Islamists criticized it and used it as an example of the persecution of Muslims by western imperialism to shed light on injustice that in reality did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He wondered how it is possible to claim that Afghani Muslims are being persecuted when Taliban forces used to execute teachers who taught females in school?</seg>

<seg id="2"> The visit of King Abdallah to Sharm Al-Sheikh directly after the Quartet's meeting ended the era of coldness and detachment that existed in the Egyptian-Saudi relationships as a result of the disagreements over their respective role in the Palestinian issue, their respective role in influencing and being influenced by this issue, and the involvement of Saudi with the Mecca agreement without the involvement of Cairo, which the Egyptians considered an insult to their diplomatic and political role over a long time of ebb and flow relations with the Palestinians. They considered what Riyadh did was to hijack the role of a regional project.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We do not want to deal with what has been done on the ground to cause the Mecca agreement to fail. We support the agreement and do not want to cause rift.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What matters now is that the Egyptian role is back on the forefront with the proposal of President Mubarak for a dialogue initiative between Hamas and Fatah in order to reach an agreement that will take the Palestinian issue out of the crisis in which it has found itself as a result of the illogical and unethical fighting by Hamas. This was said by Professor Haikal in his latest intervention regarding the Palestinian issue, but this dialogue needs a period of recuperation and healing of the family wound and concessions from both sides before reaching the negotiation table.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> This suggestion is welcomed in the Arab political circles and is met with reservation by the Authority's leadership that wants to burn the steps by announcing a policy to dismantle the early legislative and presidential elections. This is a clear divorce from the political movement. Even if we disagree with it ideologically, it will have an effect on the Palestinian political reality. Uprooting it on the logic of the law will be very difficult and dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Palestinian situation now needs a different kind of mediation; one that can influence both sides. First, to postpone Mr. Abbas's request for international forces to supervise the Strip, because the Palestinians will get into the suicide cycle, which is the final termination for the Palestinian issue. This is what the United States and Israel want, because putting Gaza under international supervision will open the door to the old project, which is handing Gaza to Egypt and the Bank to Jordan.</seg>

<seg id="9"> In Brussels, a European official said that it is unlikely that an Arab country like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will participate in the Lisbon meeting because the talks that are taking place between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are going well.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The European official said Olmert and Abbas's track is going well, and the idea is to let that continue without interference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Olmert said that he expects to meet with Abbas in the beginning of next week to discuss a number of issues including Israel's initiative to release from its jails 250 members of Fatah, which is led by Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Israel is holding around 10,000 Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Quartet's meeting is the first since the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, took over the Gaza Strip in June from Fatah that is loyal to Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This caused a transformation in the Palestinian political and security scene, so in reality it divided the Palestinians between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The last meeting for the Quartet was held in Germany on May 30.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Diplomats told Reuters that Blair wanted a broader role since he was appointed as an envoy to the Middle East, which would allow him to participate directly and in a greater way in peace making.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The European official said that the Quartet will not give him absolute freedom but Blair is a senior political figure and to some extent he will do what he wants to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Quartet specified Blair's role as collecting money for the Palestinians, building their governmental institutions and improving their economic development.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Politicians in Israel and the Palestinian Authority are not showing great optimism during their private conversations regarding the possibilities of resuming the negotiations related to the establishment of a Palestinian state.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Olmert's popularity declined and his position has become weak. It doesn't allow him to provide the concessions that the Palestinians are pursuing. Meanwhile the Palestinians are facing a dilemma because of the division between Fatah and Hamas and between the West Bank and Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But western powers are looking forward to seeing more stability. American President George Bush, whose presidency was characterized by problems in Iraq, reaffirmed that he wants to see a Palestinian state before he leaves power in 18 months.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Officials said that the Nigerian prime minister and army leaders will meet on Sunday with the President of neighboring Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to discuss cross-border cooperation to fight rebels led by Tuareg tribes in the desert, north of Niger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The rebellious Niger Movement for Justice killed at least 36 soldiers and detained dozens since the start in February of the rebellion requesting more autonomy for the vast area around the old desert city of Agadiz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The government refuses to negotiate with the group, saying they are drug- dealers and despicable gangs. But it also asked the neighboring countries to try to prevent the flow of weapons, fuel and food, that are believed to be reaching them from other armed desert groups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Some officials and civil society organizations in Niger accuse Libya of supporting the rebels who also target the mining facilities in an area that has some of the largest stocks of uranium in the world as well as oil reserves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A senior military official in Niger told Reuters that the delegation did not come to ask Algeria to play the role of mediator, like it was the case in the past, but to explain the situation and ask its authorities to support border security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The official, who asked not to be named, added of course, if Algeria managed to convince the perpetrators of these attacks that Niger will not negotiate and that they have to disarm, this would be really helpful.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The delegation will include Prime Minister Seine Oumarou, Foreign Minster Aichatou Mindaoudou, Chief of Armed Forces General Moumouni Boureima, and General Abdou Kaza, the National Security Advisor to President Mamadou Tandja.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The official Algerian news agency said that President Bouteflika received the delegation on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Algeria has in the past played the role of mediator between the Tuaregs of northern Niger and the government.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The light-skinned Bedouin Tuareq, known for their blue turbans, launched in the nineties a rebellion to ask for more autonomy from the government that is dominated by dark-skinned Africans after a brutal campaign by the security forces in which many civilians were killed.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The majority of the Tuareg groups signed a peace agreement in 1995 that promised more development in the north. The local government was fortified and promised to enroll thousands of former fighters in the security forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The rebellious movement says that these peace agreements were not fully respected and that the north is still marginalized.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The government says that the majority of the Tuareg's demands from the nineties were met.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The report, which some of its excerpts were published in the Tunisian newspaper "As-Sabah" issued today /Tuesday/, said that the Corporation attributed the reason for the increase share of the Arab countries to internal attractive factors and external driving factors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The report added that as far as internal factors are concerned, the government promotion ways have improved and efforts to prepare a climate for investment have continued through facilitating the administrative procedures, reducing their numbers, costs and the time needed to accomplish them along with increasing the number of comprehensive service centers, providing the necessary information, improving the extent of compliance with deadlines for disclosing data and the extent of its coverage according to internationally-agreed upon standards. In addition, the Arab region has increased the launch of economic cities projects and what they need from basic infrastructure in terms of airports, roads, ports and railways and a number of Arab countries have committed to finish the privatization programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report pointed to external factors that contributed to the push of investment towards the Arab region. The most prominent is the decrease revenues of the average investment outside compared with its counterpart inside the Arab region, and especially in the natural resources sector like oil and mining and the expansion of the market for some activities in the services sector, the most important of which are tourism, communications and transport sectors of all kinds and the popularity of the real estate investment market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It also contributed to the increase share of the Arab countries in direct foreign international investments. The inter-Arab investments notably continued to increase during the year 2006, especially in the tourism sector, which witnessed huge investments; its declared investments exceeded 25 billion US dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The report predicted improvement in the growth cycle of Arab trade especially exports (with the exception of Iraq, Somalia and Palestine) of products and services. It justified this by the effect of the continued increase of oil and metal prices and improved revenues from the entry of Arab exports on international markets due to the improvement in the quality standards that are applied on its products and increased efforts to develop Arab exports.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Israeli Spy Vanunu Sentenced Anew to 6 Months Imprisonment for Violating Restrictions Imposed on Him Since His Release.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Israeli nuclear activities spy Mordechai Vanunu was sentenced yesterday to 6 months enforceable detention, because he violated the restrictions imposed on him since his release in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Israeli authorities had imposed on him restrictions in return for releasing him, including a ban on overseas travel and speaking to the media and foreigners without prior authorization from the internal security service Shin Bet which alleges that he is still capable of damaging the state's security by disclosing further classified information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The court in Jerusalem found Vanunu guilty of contacts with foreigners and foreign media and an attempt at leaving the Israeli territory to go to Ramallah, thus breaching the restrictions imposed on him since his release in 2004, after spending 18 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In addition to the enforceable 6 months imprisonment, he was also sentenced to 6 months suspended imprisonment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The court announced in its decision that "despite violating the restrictions imposed on him 14 times, the court has decided to show leniency and sentence him to only 6 enforceable months of imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Vanunu was facing a seven year imprisonment penalty.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Jerusalem Court confirmed that "the defendant announced he considers" the restrictions imposed on him by the Israeli judiciary "unconstitutional".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Vanunu was released in April 2004 following spending 18 years in jail, but the judiciary has largely limited his freedom of movement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Israeli authorities believe that he is privy to accurate information from the period during which he worked at the Dimona nuclear reactor in the Negev Desert (south).</seg>
<seg id="11"> He was sentenced after disclosing Israeli nuclear secrets to the British paper Sunday Times in 1986.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Mordechai appealed a number of times to the Supreme Court to have the restrictions lifted, but to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Moroccan born Israeli Vanunu, who worked at the Israeli reactor near the town of Dimona in southern Israel in the late 70s and early 80s of the last century, insists that he has nothing new to disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Vanunu, who has embraced Christianity, does not consider himself an Isreali any more, and had unsuccessfully applied for asylum to a number of western countries since his release. He complains that he is being placed under constant surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Hebrew state had never acknowledged ownership of a nuclear arsenal, but a number of foreign experts assert on the basis of Vanunu's testimony and other sources that it possesses approximately 200 nuclear heads and long-range missiles.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon withdrew a report he had prepared about the negotiations held between Morocco and the Polisario Front last month in New York, following a dispute caused by the reports mention of the Moroccan initiative for granting self-governance to Western Sahara while making no mention of the Polisario's proposal for a referendum on self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Ban Ki-Moon confirmed the necessity of amending the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While Morocco did not immediately comment on this news, Spanish media mentioned that the objections of the Polisario and states that support it, especially Algeria and South Africa, came after Ki-Moon's report included an appeal to the Polisario to give up its ambitions and discuss the self-governance plan proposed by Morocco. This forced the international organization's Secretary General to remove the report from the official UN website to amend it, so as to avoid escalations prior to the preparations for the coming round of negotiations in New York on August 10th.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Last week, Rabat had sent implicit messages to the Polisario and the international organizer that announced it was not prepared to negotiate anything outside the self-governance proposal.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Polisario representative to the international organization Ahmed Boukhari stated on his part that, "There are two proposals on the table and both sides are going to deal with them."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Third Republican Senator Joins the List of Bush's Iraqi Policy Critics</seg>
<seg id="2"> Domenici called for a new strategy and held the Iraqi government responsible for failure</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A prominent Republican senator has joined the list of those criticizing the US President George Bush's Iraqi policy, calling for a new strategy days before a new confrontation in the Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The senator for New Mexico Pete Domenici, member of the Senate for three decades and candidate for the 2008 elections, is the third executive Republican official in the past ten days to object openly to the policy of sending more US troops to Iraq followed by the US President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> During a press conference held in Albuquerque in New Mexico the day before last, Dominici said, "I do not support the continuation of the current strategy" holding the Iraqi government responsible for failing to make even modest progress to merit the sacrifices being made by the US military."</seg>
<seg id="6"> Agence France-Presse quoted him as saying, "I do not support immediate withdrawal from Iraq, or a reduction in funding our forces."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, he added, "I support a new strategy that will move our troops out of combat operations and on the path to coming home."</seg>
<seg id="8"> He explained that "the Iraqi government is the one that fails to make even modest progress to help Iraq itself or to merit the sacrifices being made by our men and women in uniform."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The senator pointed to his support of a bill presented to the Senate that called for the implementation of the recommendations published last year by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Group had recommended the following of a policy aiming at the withdrawal of the majority of combatant US troops from Iraq by March 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It added that some of the US forces must stay in Iraq to train the new Iraqi Forces, protect US installations and carry out quick intervention missions against terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Bush said on Tuesday that the strategy based on sending enforcements of 30,000 additional troops to Iraq, which has now reached its climax, must be given a chance to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="13"> "If we depart Iraq prior to finishing the mission, the terrorists will not announce their victory and will not lie down their arms,"  he said.</seg>
<seg id="14"> He added, "They will chase us here, in our homes."</seg>
<seg id="15"> "We must win regardless to how difficult the strife in Iraq."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Last week, comments made by the high ranking executive Republican senator Richard Lugar before the Senate caused a shock through the Washington political circles when he stated that the policy of sending reinforcements has no chances for success.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The Republican George Voinovich also recommended the withdrawal from Iraq.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Domenici's announcements were made days before the Congress members return to Washington after a one week break, with the Democrats who control both Houses in the Congress getting ready for a new attack on Bush's policy in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Senior Democrat officials in the House of Representatives and the Senate  commented on Domenici's announcements.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the question was whether the Republicans who oppose Bush "will join in the vote for change of course in Iraq and return the troops home"?</seg>
<seg id="21"> "How long until you respect the wishes of the American people to end this war?" she added.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid said that "Senator Domenici is correct to assess that the Administration's strategy in this war is misguided.</seg>
<seg id="23"> "But," he added, "we will not see a much-needed change of course in Iraq until Senators like Domenici, Lugar and Voinovich stand up to President Bush and his stubborn clinging to a failed policy."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The US President's envoy to Sudan Andrew Natsios started his visit to the country yesterday with a field trip to the troubled Darfur region. The US envoy's visit, being the second after his appointment to the position early this year, comes only days after a personal attack on him by the Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir who accused him of obstructing the peace process in Darfur and "inciting the rebels in the region against peace efforts". It comes one day after the visit of two African Union and UN envoys to discuss a road map for resuming peace negotiations between the Sudanese Government and the Darfur militias rejecting the brittle Abuja Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Informed sources in Khartoum stated that the seven-day visit of the US President's envoy to Sudan aims at understanding the developments in the situation and the progress of the realization of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in the South and the Abuja Peace Agreement in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Natsios' talks include a number of officials in the country, including the First Vice President Lt. Gen. Salva Kiir Mayardit, Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha, Senior Assistant to the President Mini Arkoi Minawi, and Sudan's Foreign Affairs Minister Lam Akol Ajawin.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Subsequently, he will visit Southern Sudan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Meanwhile, the Permanent Representative of Sudan to the UN Abdel Mahmoud Abdel Halim said that closed discussions are held by the permanent members of Security Council of certain potential elements of the proposed resolution on the Hybrid Operation in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is expected that the discussions will extend throughout the current week to include experts and the remaining members of the Council, and then a session of the Security Council will be set for official deliberations on the project and the authorization of the Hybrid Operation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abdel Halim stated that this July and coming August are going to have important developments on the Darfur issue, as it is expected that the Security Council will issue a resolution on the authorization and funding of the Hybrid Operation, as well as intensifying the methods for a peaceful resolution to the problem. He pointed out the current visit to the country by the UN Envoy Jan Eliasson and African Union Special Envoy For Peace Salim Ahmed Salim, to be followed by the Tripoli Conference on Darfur mid this month, and culminating in political negotiations with the rejecters of Abuja to start in August in accordance with the specifications of the Road Map.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He also pointed out that previously agreed issues have started to be implemented, with the arrival in Khartoum of the new African Forces commander and the joint UN and African Union envoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Representative said that the Sudanese delegation in New York participates in the discussions to ensure that the proposed resolution on the Hybrid Operation conforms with the formerly ratified verities and standards.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Abdel Mahmoud explained that the Security Council will hold a session next Thursday to hear a report on its members visit to a number of African countries, including Sudan.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On the 10th Anniversary of ending the British rule in Hong Kong and the return of this island to China after 150 years, the Hong Kong Disneyland entertainment city suffering from low revenues has opened a showroom in Guangzhou in southern China yesterday, Tuesday, in an attempt to lure more Chinese visitors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The act might be of great economic importance, especially with the Chinese economy opening to the world and adopting market policy that has so far generated many wealthy people whose numbers compete with those in the western world.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The 3 billion dollar city featured in the showroom many multimedia displays  and replicas of its rides, and is the first of its kind in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5"> As part of the same promotional campaign Hong Kong Disneyland distributed, as reported by the Deutsche Presse Agentur, 270 DVD video discs  across China to encourage more Chinese particularly in southern provinces, to visit it in Hong Kong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Some reports state that there are in excess of 100 million well-off Chinese who can engage in overseas tourism, and as such Hong Kong won't be the sole benefactor of this tourist flood.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It should be mentioned that Hong Kong Disneyland opened its doors to the public in September 2005.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The ruler of Morocco King Mohammed IV renewed his support for the French President Nicolas Sarkozy's project calling for the formation of a union of the Mediterranean states.</seg>
<seg id="3"> King Mohammed IV, in his congratulatory letter sent to Sarkozy on the occasion of the French National Day which falls on July 14, described the Mediterranean project as creative because it responds to the hopes of the region's nations and contributes in relieving the real challenges faced by them, as stated in the royal letter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The King of Morocco praised the "ambitious" reforms carried out resolutely and steadily by the new French President in a way characterized by courage and far-sightedness, with the aim to continue France's radiance and to strengthen her international position.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Moroccan ruler expressed his joy at the coming initial state visit by Sarkozy in October saying that "it will create an appropriate occasion for celebrating the French-Moroccan friendship and consolidating joint efforts for championing the values of peace, democracy, dialogue and understanding among cultures."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It was planned that Sarkozy will include Morocco in his first visit to the Maghreb states, but in the end he had to do with visiting Algeria and Tunisia, as Morocco requested that Sarkozy's visit be deferred on account of the busy schedule of the Moroccan ruler who was in the town of Wajda (in the east) on the day Sarkozy visited Algeria.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Rabat justified the postponement by saying it wanted Sarkozy's official stay in Morocco to be characterized as a state visit, which is supposed to last as long as possible so as to permit the holding of deep and extensive talks and discussions that deal with regional and international issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It seems that the French presidency was satisfied by the Moroccan justifications, and quickly denied there was a passing cloud over the Rabat-Paris relations. The French president even undertook to return to the Arab Maghreb states to stay longer, and that his short visits to Algeria and Tunisia were dictated by other commitments awaiting him in his homeland in preparation for the coming political entry as well as other commitments on the European level.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Efforts by the Palestinian Authority aiming at the closure of the issue of Aqsa Brigades  (the Fatah military wing) fugitives has stumbled after Israel refused to stop pursuing 206 of the fugitives that the Authority had asked to be included  in the Israeli amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Israel justified its refusal on the grounds that the fugitives of the first list did not hand their arms to the security services, or that they did not sign an undertaking to stop attacking Israel.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Official security sources told "Al-Sharq Al-Awsat" that Israel fundamentally refuses to stop pursuing 28 fugitives from the Brigades in West Bank, most of whom from Nablus and Jenin, on the charge of contacts with the Lebanese Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Israeli paper Yediot Ahronot said that the chief of the Israeli internal security Shabak Yuval Diskin met with the Palestinian Minister of Interior Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Yahya and other security chiefs in Ramallah more than once with the aim to discuss an acceptable solution for these fugitives.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Security sources had then confirmed that to "Al-Sharq Al-Awsat", but refused to discuss the details.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But informed sources in Aqsa Brigades told "Al-Sharq Al-Awsat" that Israel proposed the exile of the 28 fugitives out of the Palestinian territories, or congregating them in the two towns of Ramallah or Jericho, and that this was rejected by the Authority.</seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the Brigades, it appears that because of the current crisis, Israel did not hand the Authority last Wednesday a provisional list which was to name 120 fugitives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It should be mentioned that a dispute ensued in the Aqsa Brigades about the decision to stop attacks on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Leaders in the Brigades rejected the decision announced by the Brigades chief in Jenin Zakaria Al-Zubaidi to cease the attacks and told "Al-Sharq Al-Awsat" that it was not binding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a related development, the Israeli Government spokeswoman Miri Eisen denied news spread by the press and agencies quoting Palestinian officials as saying that the Israeli withdrawal from the cities of Qalqilia and Jericho was imminent,</seg>
<seg id="12"> and said, "not everything the Palestinians ask for shall be done."</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Yediot Ahronot website has lately quoted a Palestinian official saying that Authority is discussing with the Israelis a plan to transfer sovereignty over the Palestinian towns in 3 stages, starting with Qalqalia and Jericho, then Ramallah and Bethlehem and ending in Tulkaram. According to the source, Nablus and Jenin have been exempted.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Furthermore, the Israeli forces have extended their operations on the West Bank and arrested over 25 Palestinians last night in different towns in the West Bank. This occurred on the eve of releasing 256 Palestinian detainees who are supposed to be freed at 9 AM and gathered at the Bitunia crossing near Ramallah according to the Israeli Prisons Department, which announced that it is awaiting the endorsement of the Israeli Supreme Court following appeals that the Palestinian prisoners release be prevented. This despite  the Israeli Public Prosecutor informing the Court that the decision is political and that the judiciary has no jurisdiction over it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> It should be mentioned that the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will welcome the released prisoners at the grave of the late President Yasser Arafat in the Presidential HQs in Ramallah.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Taliban Set a Final Deadline and Threaten to Start Killing the Koreans At Noon. Karzai's Spokesman Criticizes the Hostages Detention.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Kabul (Reuters): A Taliban spokesman said yesterday that the leaders of the movement had set 0730 GMT today, Monday, as the final deadline for the Korean hostages and said that the movement will start killing the hostages if its prisoners are not released by that time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf said the deadline had been set by the Taliban leadership council, headed by leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, giving the threat added weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The kidnappers killed the leader of the Korean group last Wednesday, but several deadlines set by the Taliban have passed without the rebels carrying out their threat to kill the remaining hostages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Yousuf told Reuters by telephone from an unknown location that "since the talks between us, the Kabul administration and Korean government have reached deadlock and they are not honest ... we will start killing the hostages if they do not start releasing our prisoners by tomorrow at 12 o'clock."</seg>
<seg id="6"> Sporadic talks between the Afghan government and South Korean diplomats on one side and Taliban rebels on the other have continually reached deadlock because of the rebel demand that Kabul government swaps prisoners for the Korean hostages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> After coming under harsh criticism for freeing five Taliban prisoners in exchange for the release of an Italian hostage in March, the Afghan President Hamid Karzai has previously ruled out reaching a deal with the Taliban.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In his first comment on the latest hostage case, Karzai condemned the kidnapping, but did not talk of the possibility of reaching a deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A spokesman quoted him as saying that "hostage-taking and the abuse of foreign guests, especially women, is against Islam and Afghan culture and the perpetration of such heinous acts on our soil represents total contempt for our Islamic and Afghan values."</seg>
<seg id="10"> An Afghan minister said on Saturday force might be used if talks fail.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Vatican described the kidnapping as a "grave violation of human dignity that clashes with every fundamental norm of civility and rights and gravely offends divine law".</seg>
<seg id="12"> Eighteen of the remaining hostages are women.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yousuf said some of the captives, who are held in small groups at different locations, were sick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Ghazni's governor, Mirajuddin Pathan, said medicines the Korean government had wanted to send to the hostages could not be delivered on Saturday because the Afghan team could not establish contact with the Taliban.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> He added that the government did not want to use force to rescue the hostages,</seg>
<seg id="16"> and told Reuters that "we have no plan of attack".</seg>
<seg id="17"> "We are trying to send the delegation for more talks."</seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to Afghan forces, foreign troops are also stationed in Ghazni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> South Korean special envoy Baek Jong-chun met Karzai yesterday to discuss ways to end the hostages' crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The Taliban are also holding one German and four of his Afghan colleagues, abducted from a neighbouring province a day before the Koreans.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Another German seized alongside them was later found dead with gunshot wounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The abduction of the Koreans is the largest kidnapping of foreigners by the Taliban since U.S.-led and Afghan forces overthrew it from power in 2001.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It comes amid an increase of violence in the past 18 months, the bloodiest period since Taliban's removal.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Dubai, 07/11/2007 (AFP) - On Tuesday the leader of the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb criticized the efforts aimed at improving relations between Algeria and France and called on France to "admit all its crimes perpetrated against Muslims in Algeria."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a statement published today on the Internet, the organization's Emir Abu Musab Abdul Wudud  denounced in particular efforts towards, as he said, signing a friendship treaty between France and its former colony Algeria.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The statement, which coincided with the French President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to Algeria on Tuesday, said "There is still a wall of skulls and dead bodies and a sea of tears and blood separating France and Muslims," adding that according to him "real Islam rejects the notion of friendship with unbelievers,"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> France colonized Algeria in 1830 and continued to occupy it until Algeria's independence in 1962, after a war for liberation in which more than one million people were martyred.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The history of France in Algeria, since 1830, has been full of crimes, repression, hegemony, tyranny and murders. Readers of this history shall find little in over two centuries that could warrant even superficial relations with France, let alone justification for friendship with it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Sarkozy stated that he will return to visit Algeria in November, on a state visit that is being prepared "by both countries and that will have concrete results".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The signing of the bilateral friendship treaty clashed with France's rejection of Algeria's demand it admitted to "colonial crimes".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The French President repeatedly said he refuses his country's expression of regret for the colonial past and blaming the sons for their forbearers acts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Abdel Wudud demanded in particular that France "admit all its crimes committed against Muslims in Algeria, because as the saying goes, admission is the first step to reconciliation," pointing to Germany's admission to what it did to the Jews.</seg>
<seg id="11"> "So what prevents France from admitting like Germany did?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He ended his statement in a threatening tone, saying, "If Sarkozy carries on with his old perversity and continues insisting  that sons cannot apologize for the actions of their fathers, he will have to expect that sons in Algeria will not keep silent on what happened to their fathers."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He also demanded that France stops interfering into Algerian affairs and that it withdraws its forces from Afghanistan and Lebanon.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Washington, 07/30/2007 (AFP) - The Commander of the US Forces in Iraq Gen. David Petraeus said on Monday in an interview with the US ABC News Channel that "he does not believe" the British are currently preparing for the withdrawal of their forces from Iraq.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> And while the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is holding talks with the US President George Bush in Camp David (east Maryland), press news reports have indicated a withdrawal plan from Iraq of the 5500 British troops. Brown's spokesman, however, denied these reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Gen. Petraeus said, "I don't believe there is a plan."</seg>
<seg id="5"> "There is a plan for a gradual withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="6"> They have started in recent months to transfer some of the gear to the Iraqi Security Forces in Basra (south) and they intend to continue this in the coming months."</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="9"> In response to a question about armaments contracts of no less than 20 billion dollars with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and five other Gulf states, as well as the probability of Saudi militants being present in Iraq, the US general said "I am not even sure that they come from Saudi Arabia."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Washington, 08/01/2007 (AFP) - US Vice President Dick Cheney announced Tuesday that the strategy of sending reinforcements to Iraq has led to improved security in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Responding to a question by the US TV station CNN, Cheney also defended the Iraqi deputies' option to go on a one month holiday, saying that "it's better than taking two months off, which was their original plan," while admitting that the US was "eager" to see them complete their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Last month, a preliminary report by the White House on the effect of the new strategy mentioned that the progress achieved by the Iraqi Parliament is insufficient for the necessary reforms, and particularly the legislation on the distribution of oil revenues which are increasing the tensions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the US Vice President believes that the report on the effect of the new strategy, which is due to be submitted in September, will show that "important progress was achieved" through the goals defined by the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Speaking about the report of the US Forces Commander in Iraq Gen. David Petraeus and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker, Cheney said he "believed it will show we made important progress."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Information I obtained from people I respect indicates that the Petraeus Plan is in fact on its way to achieving results," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> After confirming that the decision to invade Iraq in March 2003 was correct, Cheney finished by saying, "we (himself and President George Bush) will end our term before January 2009, and I think we'll be able to hold our heads high knowing we did the best we could for the country."</seg>

<seg id="3"> The night before last, Al-Qaeda Organization broadcasted a video film containing the events of the clashes with the Algeria security forces in one of  the Tizi Ouzou mountains that culminated in the terrorist explosion that killed seven soldiers and burnt down security forces vehicles during the terrorist explosion, using a bomb planted on the main road during the intermittent passage of security convoys.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The tape shows a number of members in the terrorist groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda giving chase to some of the security troops who escaped from the vehicles when the explosion occurred, in addition to shots from alternating attacks on each  of the two parties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the same video, the Emir of the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arab Maghreb Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud threatened a series of attacks and terrorist activities against Algerian public departments and institutions in many parts of Algeria, indicating that this was part of Al-Qaeda's method in expanding its operations during the coming phase.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Emir of Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb also threatened to target many US and European interests in the Arab Maghreb region, and to resist through violent and terrorist acts the US attempts at establishing the headquarters of the United States African Command, known as AFRICOM, in the Arab Maghreb and African Sahel regions.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Emir of Al-Qaeda Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud called on the Algerian youth to refuse joining the security and the military forces in the coming phase so that they don't get hurt during Al-Qaeda's operations against the security forces.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> London - News Agencies:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In an article published by the popular News Of the World tabloid yesterday, the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband affirmed the strength of his country's relations with the United Nations, denying what was being said about a slight change in the London-Washington relations following the assumption of office by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Miliband clarifies that the US was still Britain's top ally.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Miliband wrote that "with a new Brown government, some people are looking for evidence that our alliance with the United States is breaking up."</seg>
<seg id="5"> He added that there isn't any breaking up and there won't be any, and that nothing has changed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "Our relationship with the USA is the strongest, in comparison to our other bilateral relationships, and we are stronger together than we are apart. Our shared values give us real strength," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand, Miliband spoke of shared sacrifice on the level of other efforts, such as climate change, poverty in Africa and terrorism, challenges that according to him cannot be faced without the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The new Trade and Development Secretary Douglas Alexander had confirmed last Thursday in Washington the benefits of a policy based on multilateralism. This was explained as a slight change in the British foreign policy.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Every Day, by Mursi Attallah</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> If  Al-Qaeda Organization aims most of its terrorist operations at fighting Israel, as the Al-Qaeda's propaganda rhetorical literature states, then why has there not been a single terrorist operation carried out against Israel?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> It might seem a strange question, but it is in my opinion a genuine and logical one. If Al-Qaeda Organization justifies its terrorist operations in Arab and Islamic countries by saying that these regimes deal with Israel and accept walking the peace path with the Hebrew state, then why doesn't Al-Qaeda take a shortcut and hit Israel, the enemy and opponent?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although some who pose this question aim at implying that this represents Israel's involvement in those operations, no one was as yet able to provide conclusive proof of that. As such, these implications remain mere doubts and suspicions that do not reach the levels of directly accusing Israel, despite that these implications do not rule out that Al-Qaeda's could be, consciously or unconsciously, an internal collaborator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In fact, whoever carefully studies the contents of the major Israeli papers, whether articles or reports, will clearly feel that Israeli sources close to the official circles in Israel state resolutely and confidently that Israel "is not part of Al-Qaeda's targets". This has raised many questions about the source of confidence among the Israelis about not being targeted by Al-Qaeda.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And whereas these Israeli sources tried to cover this up by saying that Al-Qaeda Organization only targets the Christian world, this malicious talk not only intends to keep suspicion away from Israel, but also aims at creating discord between Islam and Christianity under the cloak of  incorrect lies propagated by Western media circles close to Israel that portray Al-Qaeda Organization as one of the highlights of the Arab and Muslim world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But the doubtless fact is that the violence practiced by Israel and the gross injustice heaped on the Palestinians as a result of its hostile policies represents the best environment that facilitates the opportunity for Al-Qaeda Organization to work freely and enlist new generations of radicals oppressed by  injustice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In return, the terrorist acts carried out by Al-Qaeda Organization provide Israel with a great service towards tying resistance to terrorism on the one hand, and rationalizing all forms of aggression and excessive use of force with the right to self-defense on the other!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Frankly and without beating about the bush, those who thwart the holding of an international anti-terrorist conference are not far removed from all the posed questions, nor from the whispered and loudly proclaimed doubts and suspicions that so far have no conclusive proof but which in the future, under new international conditions and balances that do not permit double standards, might become detailed pleadings full of all the impeachment proofs, awaiting a fair judge who will put an end to this disgusting phenomenon called terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="1"> At Close Quarters, by Salama Ahmed Salama</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When the State Lies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The storm caused by the sale of Cairo Bank has not abated, not even after the Governor of the Reserve Bank admitted that the bank had reached a serious stage that could not be ignored, and which led to its impeded performance and the inability of the Reserve Bank to bear the additional bill for fixing its problems.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Besides, the state's budget which is suffering from severe deficit anyway, was not able to provide 20 billion pounds to meet its debts and compensate for the deficit in its appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="5"> So the government put 80% of Cairo Bank for sale to a major investor, after it found out, belatedly, that the notion of mergers or repossession was not an effective cure</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> This is, simply, the picture that reached the public opinion of the majority of economic laymen such as myself. It followed a huge debate on this issue between those in the know and those not in the know, and between those who defend the government whether it is right or at fault and those who criticize it with such sound political and economic arguments as, for example, that selling Egyptian banks to foreign investors represents a danger to the national economy and opens the door to foreign control of funding development projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And no matter how true or wrong the arguments of each team, the government will generally do what it has on its mind and will carry on with the procedures of selling the bank. This is because it is more committed to a drafted plan for what it calls the Financial Sector Reform which is based on agreements with international organizations,  and whose details are locked away from public view in the drawers of the Policy Committee; than to its commitment to the laws of transparency that it talks about!!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But the real problem in my opinion is not in what necessitated the sale of the Cairo Bank, but in the widespread culture of hiding facts in the public administration, of covering up mistakes and burying heads in the sand until the matter explodes wholesale. It appears that the problem of the stumbling Cairo Bank did not happen in a single day, but goes back six years. The consecutive governments did not bother to make it public and deal with it. This poses the question about the political and legal indemnity of a number of prime ministers and former ministers during whose time the bank's coffers were opened to a number of businessmen who scooped up loans without collateral and escaped with them overseas.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This, probably, is the most important reason that made the Cairo Bank stumble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The political regime in Egypt does not acknowledge the principle of holding political officials accountable.</seg>
<seg id="11"> They are not punished for crimes of negligence, nepotism, and misuse of public funds.</seg>
<seg id="12"> What happened in the financial sector to make an Egyptian bank reach the edge of bankruptcy repeats itself in some form or another in other sectors.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Like the sudden shortage of water, the collapse of the railways and the sea transport utilities, and others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> They are all the result of relegating problems and hiding them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The responsibility for this deteriorating situation of the state organs is not the responsibility of the employees who lie with their directors' knowledge,</seg>
<seg id="16"> because the whole state lies and falsifies numbers and data; all because of the lack of accountability and transparency on all levels, despite the multiplicity of control and auditing institutions.</seg>

These included the visit by the Egyptian and Jordanian Foreign Ministers to Israel last Wednesday as a continuation of the Arab peace initiative, as well as the visit of the US Secretary of State to Egypt late this month.</seg>
<seg id="4"> ِ A diplomatic source stressed that Egypt continues to consider the Palestinian humanitarian crisis the topmost priority, as an urgent matter not permitting delays, while continuing to work on making life better for the Palestinians and improving the economic situation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> The European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana made a call to Aboul Gheit during which they discussed the most important results of his and his Jordanian counterpart's visit to Israel as part of the necessary advocacy for the Arab peace initiative. A diplomatic source explained that the Foreign Minister is preparing a report with Jordan's Foreign Minister to brief the League of Arab States at the ministerial meeting to be held on Monday, after tomorrow. The report includes the most important results of the visit in accordance to what the ministerial committee on the Arab initiative had decided during its meeting on last April 18th.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> The Foreign Minister assured that Egypt emphasized to all parties that the opportunity is ripe for re-launching the negotiations, and that there is space for contributions to the momentum of positive action, while Israel continues to take effective long-term steps that the Palestinian people can feel.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Minister of Petroleum Eng. Sameh Fahmi inspected some new oil fields in the Western Desert and the new facilities in the area, as well as the specialized Al-Hamra Petroleum Port considered to be among the most important strategic sites for loading and exporting crude oil. It is considered the main collection point for crude oil produced in the Western Desert, with 185,000 barrels being handled per day and expected to reach 225,000 barrels in the coming period.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Minister pointed out that Al-Hamra Port has all the necessary ingredients for converting it into a major export center using an advanced workflow system. The Minister demanded that a study be prepared to develop Al-Hamra Petroleum Port facilities and the pipelines connected to it, so as to increase its export capacity which currently stands at 600,000 barrels per month to one million barrels per month, and to increase the storage containers' capacity from 800,000 barrels to one million barrels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> During the inspection visit, the Director of the Western Desert Development Committee Eng. Shamel Hamdi reviewed a report on the development of production in the Western Desert region and the production situation following the placing of some of the newly discovered fields on the production map. This will increase the production of the Western Desert by approximately 40,000 barrels per day, with total regional production to reach approximately 270,000 barrels per day this coming April.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The visit included inspection of crude oil reception lines at the port, which consist of three major lines, as well as inspection of the delivery and loading of crude oil via landpipes, the storage depots and pumps at the loading stations.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Minister also inspected the Comprehensive Branch Center for Preventing Oil Sea Pollution, which contains the newest equipment for countering sea pollution. He also inspected the chemical laboratory at the port specializing in quality assurance of the crude oil, and fitted with state-of-the-art technological equipment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Minister for Petroleum held an open meeting with the workers from the various oil companies working at Al-Hamra Port, these being Badr Aldin, GAPCO, WEPCO, AGIPA, Al-Hamra, Oil Pipes, Khalda, Janoub Al-Daba'a and Al-Alamein. The Minister listened to their ideas and suggestions on improving performance so as to execute the scheduled programs planned for increasing productivity.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tokyo - News Agencies:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe confirmed yesterday that he will remain in his post despite the crushing defeat of his Liberal Democratic Party in the upper house elections the day before last. He said these results needed to be looked at very seriously and promised to continue the reforms to build the nation and encourage economic growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> It is worth mentioning that Abe's coalition will not be removed from power because of the upper house elections since it maintains a large majority in the lower house which elects the prime minister. However, Abe said he will reshuffle his cabinet in an attempt to regain voters' trust.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He added that the people demand a complete change, in addition to changes in the leadership positions of the party. Abe faces pressure to resign from within his Liberal Democratic Party which had ruled Japan for most of the past 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Japanese paper Yomiuri quoted the former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba as saying that Abe must resign, because if he doesn't the Party will soon be finished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> But analysts say that the lack of a suitable successor to Abe in the party at this time could assist him in staying in power for some time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Japanese paper Mainichi Shimbun mentioned that Abe should dissolve the lower house quickly and submit to the will of the people, but Abe rejected any dissolution of the lower house or the holding of early parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="9"> And although Abe refused to resign, the second in charge in his party resigned because of the party's crushing defeat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Liberal Democratic Party and its partner in the coalition New Komeito Party won 46 seats in the upper house , as compared to 60 seats won by the major opposition party, the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The ruling coalition needed 64 seats to maintain its majority in the upper house, as the elections were held for half of the 242 seats of the house.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Abe's party won 37 seats, the worst defeat yet since that of 1998 which forced  Ryutaro Hashimoto to resign his premiership.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The angry voters deprived Abe's cabinet of the majority because of a series of scandals and the government's errors in dealing with the pension records problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Abe is the youngest Japanese prime minister since World War II, and was the Chief Cabinet Secretary in the previous government.</seg>

<seg id="7"> "It looks like I might be signing an agreement to make an atomic bomb," he said, then added: "We don't need an atomic bomb, because we own it. Our atomic bomb is called the Venezuelan people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Chavez arrived in Tehran on Saturday evening at the head of a delegation consisting of the ministers for foreign affairs, energy, economy, industry and communications. He and Ahmadinejad are expected to visit the Asaluyeh energy producing zone in the gulf to inaugurate a petrochemical plant.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Contracts will be signed during the visit, one of them for building 7,000 homes and a petrochemical unit in Venezuela.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry Mohammad Ali Hosseini announced that Latin America, which Nejad visited last January, "is a region with new horizons for strengthening our relations."</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega visited Tehran last June 10th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Venezuelan Ambassador in Iran Arturo Anibal Gallegos Ramirez announced that the visit "aims at improving bilateral cooperation in the economic, industrial and political sectors."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> On the nuclear front, Hosseini informed that his country was considering the Time-Out proposal that imposes the suspension of its uranium enrichment program in return for the suspension of the impositions of further United Nations sanctions against it. He confirmed, however, that "suspending the enrichment is not an option," while a diplomat in Vienna said that international powers are discussing the proposal of the idea to Iran to end the nuclear crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei had proposed this idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Hosseini said "The proposal does not contain anything new, and it was discussed previously,</seg>
<seg id="16"> but Iran is still considering it," adding that "Tehran is willing to consider all plans and proposals that include its rights to the negotiation process."</seg>
<seg id="17"> He added that the Iran's top negotiator Ali Larijani and the European Union High Representative for the Foreign Policy Javier Solana discussed the proposal during the talks on the nuclear disagreement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> But Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission announced the Time-Out idea is not a suitable solution either.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This coincided with efforts by the US President George Bush to obtain the support of his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for imposition of wider sanctions on Iran during their talks in the US State of Maine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> In another development, Haaretz paper wrote that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had recently appointed the Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor Lieberman to deal with countering the Iranian nuclear program, following deliberations with the Mosad chief Meir Dagan, the Director General of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission Gideon Frank, the head of the National Security Council Ilan Mizrahi, the Chief of Shabak Yuval Diskin and senior officials in the ministries of foreign affairs, defence and Israeli Army, and especially from the Military Intelligence Unit.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Yemen: the Suicide Bomber of Queen of Sheba Temple.. an Arab</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh said that preliminary investigations of the suicide attack that targeted a bus of Spanish tourists in Marib Province and resulted in the death of seven Spaniards and two Yemeni drivers, while injuring others, indicates that the attacker was not a Yemenite but an Arab national.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He promised to disclose the details very soon, after the attacker's DNA is tested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The official intial accusations against Al-Qaeda organization in Yemen as being responsible for the attack indicated the possibility that the attacker of the Temple of Queen Sheba was a Yemenite; perhaps one of last year's 23 fugitives from the political security (the intelligence) prison, since the organization announced the appointment of one of them, Nasir Al-Wuhayshi (Abu Basir), as the new leader. An audio recording in which one of the wanted fugitives, Qasim Al-Raymi (Abu Horeirah),  threatens "assaults" described as "jihad against the crusaders and their supporters in Yemen" was also distributed.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Abu Horeirah denied any negotiations with the Yemeni government, saying he was charged by Abu Basir to make this recorded announcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Yemeni President described the attack on tourists in Marib as "criminal, terrorist, cowardly and dirty", threatening the direst punishment against all Al-Qaeda members.</seg>
<seg id="9"> "We will pursue them wherever they are, wherever they go, or hide. We will punish them severely for the crimes they committed against innocent tourists and their Yemeni companions, and against the country, its interests, security and stability."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Ali Saleh announced a reward of 15 million Yemeni riyals (US$75,000) to anyone who will provide information that would lead to the arrest of the terrorist elements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> As a Spanish plane carrying the Spanish Tourism Minister and families of the victims arrived in Sanaa to transport the bodies of the Spanish victims, the authorities begun investigations into the suicide bomber's DNA tests to verify his identity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He executed the attack in a Toyota Jeep 1982 model.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Yemeni authorities took additional stringent security measures and procedures in embassies, hotels and all foreign establishments around the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Yemeni government circles consider the suicide attack a painful blow for tourism, following information that European and foreign tourism agencies cancelled the bookings of thousands of tourists who were part of tourist tours this summer.</seg>
<seg id="15"> They said that the Yemeni economy "will be adversely affected and lose large revenues from tourism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As such, the Yemeni Council of Deputies strongly criticized the government and accused the security bodies of negligence and ignoring latest threats made by Al-Qaeda members about imminent and painful "terrorist" attacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The Council issued a statement to denounce the attack and exonerated Islam from "terrorist" elements. It summoned the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Interior Dr. Rashad Al-Alimi to appear before the deputies next Sunday and answer their questions about the negligence.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Thousands of Palestinians Still Stranded At the Egyptian Border</seg>
<seg id="2"> The Deposed Palestinian Government and Numerous Factions Refuse to Open the Karam Abu Salem Crossing Instead of Rafah Crossing</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Palestinian rejection was loud against the entry of a few thousand Palestinians stranded in Egypt into the Gaza Strip through the Karam Abu Salem crossing, called by Israel Kerem Shalom, situated on the meeting point of the Palestinian-Egyptian-Israeli borders, south east of Rafah city in the far south of the Strip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The deposed national unity government and a number of resistance factions expressed their ultimate rejection of replacing the Rafah border  with the Kerem Shalom crossing as a corridor and exit for the Palestinians to the world.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The factions expressed their rejection by having their military wings fire mortar missiles and rockets into the crossing which was originally reserved for entrance of goods into the Strip and not for the movement of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> These attitudes surfaced following rumours about an Egyptian-Israeli agreement to open Kerem Shalom crossing today, Wednesday, for a single day to permit 4,000 Palestinians stranded in such Egyptians cities as Rafah, Al-Arish and Cairo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> These Palestinians, among whom are 600 sick persons, suffer hardships because of the refusal of the Israeli occupation to open the crossing for about a month to permit the Palestinians to return to the Strip or leave it freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Israel had permitted the opening of the crossing for two consecutive days on the 6th and 7th of last month, and since then refused to reopen it, especially as Hamas movement used force to gain control over Gaza Strip on the 14th of last month.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Israel closed the Rafah border crossing permanently for the first time after the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier Gilead Shalit in a guerilla act executed by Hamas , Popular Resistance Committees and Jaish Al-Islam fighters at an Israeli military site near Kerem Shalom on June 25, 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Since then, Israel has permitted the opening of Rafah crossing on an average of four to six days a month, distributed throughout its four weeks; at other times the closure continues uninterrupted for a month or more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a statement issued yesterday by the deposed government it demanded the opening of Rafah crossing to passenger movement "so that the Strip does not become a huge prison".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The government expressed its definite rejection of "all Israeli attempts aiming to move Rafah border crossing (...) to Karam Abu Salem, so that the Egyptian-Palestinian border remains clear of any interference or foreign custodianship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Hamas Movement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Islamic Jihad, Popular Resistance Committees and Martyr Ahmed Abu Alrish Brigades joined the government in rejecting the entry of those stranded through Kerem Shalom, and demanded the re-opening of Rafah border crossing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Many of the activists, among them tens injured, are afraid to return via the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing for fear of being arrested by the occupation forces that control all the details of the crossing's operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Israel established the Kerem Shalom crossing according to the Gaza Strip border crossings operation protocol known as the Rice Agreement, reached on November 15, 2005 following the Israeli withdrawal from the Strip on September 10 of that same year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The protocol states that Rafah crossing be reserved for the movement of Palestinians, diplomats and others, as well as the export of goods from the Strip, and that it remains under the Palestinian-Egyptian control and the observation by a delegation of European observers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It also stipulates that Kerem Shalom crossing be used for the entry of goods for the approximately 1.5 million Palestinians who live on the coastal stretch no more than 365 square kilometers in area.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Kurdistan Region Prime Minister Nechirvan Barazani confirmed that detainees in Kurdish prisons have their rights abused, while the Islamic Group in Kurdistan defied the government's decision to ban the Chemchemel Mosque meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a press conference he said that "it is not possible for me to say that what the Human Rights Watch report stated was correct or incorrect. In fact there are abuses and we in the Kurdistan Region government carried out good prison reforms. We cooperated and opened the prison doors to the organization at a time when many governments refuse it entry to its prisons. This is the best proof that we intend to carry out radical reforms in these prisons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "We asked the relevant bodies and prison authorities to investigate what the report said, and I personally called for the report to be published and announced very clearly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Minister for Human Rights in the Kurdish cabinet Mohammed Aziz stated that the report issued by the US Human Rights Watch organization about the state of prisons in the region "was exaggerated" and explained that it covered the period between last April and October 2006, in which period the unification of the region's two administration had not yet been finalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He pointed out that "the Ministry agrees with some of what the report stated", stressing that it "neglected the positives achieved recently in the region in improving conditions in prisons, as well as discharging 400 persons following the application of the amnesty legislation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Kurdish government denies that detainee and prisoner's rights are abused in Kurdistan at the time when Arab parties demand the disclosure of the fate of 250 prisoners who were secretly transferred from Kirkuk Prison to Kurdish prisons in Aqra, Arbil and Suleymaniyah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On its part, the Kurdish Ministry for Endowments and Religious Affairs issued an order banning any political or party gatherings in the region's mosques, stressing the need to make the mosques "places of worship, not political activity". It warned that it will carry out strict measures against any party that attempts to use mosques and other worship places for party purposes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A statement issued by the Ministry said that "the Islamic Group requested permission to hold a meeting in the Chemchemel Mosque, but the Ministry refused. Despite that, the Group defied the Ministry and held the meeting chaired by its Emir. As such the Ministry for Endowments and Religious Affairs warns political parties against using mosques, which are places of worship, and exploit them for political or party purposes. The Ministry will take all legal actions against any who breach its orders."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Constitutional Amendments and Demand For a Permanent Seat in the Security Council.. Love and Hate Relationships With Neighbors.. Japan: Cautious Plunge and Shy Ambitions to Play a Role Overseas After Overcoming the Historical Feelings of Enmity</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One finds it perplexing, particularly on one's first visit, to get to know a country that has invaded our imagination, while being thousands of miles away, with its economic progress and especially its technological superiority, not to mention overcoming  the worst disaster a nation ever suffered in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What is the secret of this success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How could Japan overcome the disastrous destruction that it suffered after World War II, and deal with the effects of the United States bombing of the two cities of Heroshima and Nagazaki with nuclear bombs, and rebuild what war had destroyed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How did it overcome the feelings of enmity against its former arch-enemy, the United States, to become its best ally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In recent years Japan has witnessed huge changes and continues to do so. The most prominent among them is a clear tendency to exit the "isolation" state and engage more in international activities. This was manifest in the amendments of the "peaceful" constitution that permits the deployment of Japanese forces overseas, and the announcement of other amendments, as well as the demand for a permanent seat in the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="7"> So what is the secret of this cautious plunge and shy ambitions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> How does Japan perceive the Middle East region and its neighboring countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Japan's relationship with its neighbors, and especially with North Korea and China, is a love-hate relationship.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Japan, which is an archipelago spread over the Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan, believes it is a victim of geography and history.</seg>
<seg id="11"> North Korea on one hand, with its ballistic missiles and nuclear program, and China with its doubled military expenditure on the other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Japanese people are naturally quiet, you seldomly hear their voices, tirelessly dedicated to work.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The worry demonstrated by some politicians in North Korea and China about neighboring policies are not reflected in the layman who, like most developed countries' people, gives priority in his life to internal issues.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Corruption, high cost of living, unemployment and health insurance worry the Japanese more than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="15"> And although Japan will witness parliamentary elections at the end of this month, residents seem worried about internal issues, the most prominent being the scandal of lost pensioner records.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="2"> Representatives of Lebanese political parties will arrive in Paris today for the inter-Lebanese dialogue which starts at St. Cloude in a suburb of the French capital Paris.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Among those who left Beirut yesterday was Dr. Mahmoud Berri and the Head of Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Amal Party Ali Hamdan, who met with the Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri prior to departure and were issued by him with the necessary directives for the conference,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A number of participants left Beirut on Friday, and it is expected that the remaining participants in the conference that will be held until the day after tomorrow, coming Monday, will leave today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In his statement yesterday, the Grand Mufti of the Republic, Sheikh Mohammed Rashid Qabbani called on the representatives of the Lebanese participating parties to agree amongst themselves on "restoring political activity to the constitutional institutions because such a restoration complements the Arab efforts by the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States Amr Moussa among the Lebanese parties, and with the role played by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in trying to save Lebanon, sponsored by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Former Prime Minister Rashid Al-Solh said in a statement he hoped "the Lebanese reach some solutions during the St. Cloude meeting for the sake of the people and the country, as happened before in Taif."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Some in Lebanon have tried wars and conflicts and it got them nowhere. Events have proven that there is no solution but direct meeting of Lebanese, or starting a dialogue, for the sake of their country and their fates," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Zahle deputies' Popular Bloc said in its statement issued after their meeting chaired by Elie Skaff that "the coming together of the conference is a positive sign of the logic of concurrence and dialogue winning over the politics of appropriation and monopolization."</seg>
<seg id="9"> It called on the ruling team to "seize the available opportunity of this dialogue forum and effectively contribute, away from media agitation, procrastination and stalling, to come up with an environtment suitable for an intermin concordant solution based on the preservation of civil peace."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> MP Antoun Zahre (Lebanese Forces) declared that "the St. Cloude conference should lead to a specific truce and to the affirmation that dialogue can be reestablished at the level of Lebanese leadership so as to provide solutions."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In a statement issued after its weekly meeting yesterday, the Supreme Council of the National Liberal Party hoped that the St. Cloude conference will be "a window in the wall of separation between the Lebanese parties, although we won't hold our breaths for any qualitative dialogue leap, seeing the latest indications shown by the opposition."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> An Islamic Party MP Azhar Al-Samarrai said her party "demanded constitutional guarantees ahead of its participation in the new alliance, and primarily a general amnesty for detainees, the formation of balancing institutions within the cabinet and each ministry, and supporting this with constitutional legislation that ensures its being carried out."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Member of the United Iraqi Coalition MP Hassan Sunaid confirmed official dialogue channels were opened with the Islamic Party and it was invited to join the moderate political forces project.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He told Al-Hayat that the "Islamic Party had given an initial approval of the working paper it was presented with, which contained the basic principles on which the new alliance is based." He pointed out that "the party is currently seeking applicable guarantees for the things mentioned in the working paper," and stressed that "the new alliance is a framework for cooperation between the four main blocs - the Supreme Islamic Council, Daawa Party and the two Kurdish parties - that will become the motion setter for the whole political process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> To this end, President Jalal Talabani described the Iraqi List chaired by Iyad Allawi as "patriotic and democratic, bringing together deputies who represent various spectrums of the people." During his reception of a number of the List's MPs he expressed his hope that Allawi will participate "in strengthening the political process, and achieve a national front that will represent the main forces committed to democracy and federalism."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Worries of the Turkish Winner</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The job of today's Turkish legislative elections will not be at all easy.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Major internal and external challenges await him.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Middle East expects more unrest,</seg>
<seg id="5"> and its states expect more worries.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It would be enough for the winner to look at the map and recollect unexpected events.</seg>
<seg id="7"> All expect the most probably prime winner to be the Justice and Development Party led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan and of whom it is demanded to deal with the increasing chaos in the region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> There is a major and serious event known as the Iraqi bomb.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Turkey coexisted skillfully with the US invasion of Iraq. But coexistence after the invasion seems more risky.</seg>
<seg id="10"> President George Bush's ability to claim successes from the ruins of his adventures is diminishing.</seg>
<seg id="11"> His ability to withstand calls for scheduling the withdrawal are eroding.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Withdrawal means that the region's states will be faced with the Iraqi fireball and its consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If Iran is the prime beneficiary from the US invasion of Iraq, Turkey has emerged from it as a loser.</seg>
<seg id="14"> There is a gross imbalance in the Turkish-Iraqi-Iranian triangle.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Turkey's problem in Iraq can not be reduced to the Kurdistan Workers Party fighters fortified in the mountainous region and instituting raids from it.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The more difficult problem lies in the formation of a semi-state in Iraqi Kurdistan, whose relative stability will lead to the revival of what the Kurdish diaspora in the adjoining states, and especially Turkey, have dreamt of.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Besides, invading the Iraqi Kurdistan is no longer an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The assumption of this role by the army will cost internal tugging between Erdogan's party rotted in Islam and the vanguard of secularism with the military establishment at its head.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The invasion will also cost relations with the US and the European Union into which Turkey is attempting to sneak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> There is another challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21"> What should Turkey do in the face of the extensive attack by Iran to grab the regional leadership and sneak into the nuclear countries club?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Will the Atlantic umbrella be enough to deter, or does it too need a nuclear pillow before it can sleep at ease?</seg>
<seg id="23"> Last October I asked the Turkish Prime Minister in Istanbul how his country will respond if Iran carried out a nuclear test.</seg>
<seg id="24"> "This is a military question," he responded smilingly.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I repeated the question, and he repeated the answer.</seg>
<seg id="26"> I heard it said in Istanbul that the army was discussing this matter and insists that it stays out of reach of politicians and the media.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Other issues could also be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The Arab-Israeli conflict and the increasing presence of Al-Qaeda in the region; the growth of denominational tensions and the widespread instability in more than one place.</seg>
<seg id="29"> For the record, Erdogan's government has gone far on the road of preparing Turkey for a role in the Middle East under the rubric of searching for stability.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It improved its relations with Syria and Iran, while maintaining strong relations with moderate Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It maintained its relations with Israel, and improved the ones with Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Turkey's participation in the UNIFIL in South Lebanon was notable, as was the attempt to open the Israeli-Syrian negotiations which followed the attempt to diminish the disagreement between Beirut and Damascus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The winner will also have to deal with the European dream.</seg>
<seg id="34"> That negotiations with the European Union are underway does not mean that the membership is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Measures taken by Erdogan's government still fall short of the Union's standards.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The issue is larger than conditions for eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Europe is worried about immigration, unemployment and the arrivals' inability to integrate, and fears for its identity.</seg>
<seg id="38"> There are voices in Europe openly saying that Turkey is neither culturally nor geographically European, and that its joining warns of change to the Union's identity.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Most likely Turkey will remain under observation for many years, despite the Europeans being aware of the importance of its stability for numerous reasons, being a safe East-West energy corridor among them.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Taliban Movement carried out its threat by executing one of the 23 South Koreans kidnapped in Ghazni province last week, accusing Kabul of "dishonest" negotiations manner and announcing that "its final deadline before executing more hostages ended at 8:30 PM yesterday."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The movement's spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousif demanded that the Koreans pressure Kabul so as to avoid the risk of having the remaining kidnapped killed.</seg>
<seg id="4"> But the South Korean Yonhap News Agency quoted a government official in Seoul whose identity remains unknown as saying that the Taliban released eight hostages. The movement had previously announced that "eight of the Korean hostages are sick."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Yonhap mentioned that it was reported South Korea paid ransom money to obtain the release of its nationals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Taliban also released the German Stern reporter Christoff Reuter and his Afghan interpreter, after kidnapping them for hours in Konar province (east) adjoining the border with Pakistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The governor of Konar province Shalizai Didar explained that tribal chiefs interceded for the release of Reuter who traveled to Konar to investigate the death of 23 persons in an air raid launched two weeks ago by NATO.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In a separate development, a French serviceman was killed in a rocket attack on barracks belonging to the Afghan army in Wirdak province (south west), where he was training a military unit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In Pakistan, the police announced that at least nine civilians were killed and another 41 injured in an attack carried out by Islamists who fired five rockets on the town of Banu in north Waziristan (north west) adjoining the border with Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Police chief Dar Ali Khatak explained that the rockets were fired every half hour after midnight destroying four houses and injuring seven policemen. He said they were probably fired in revenge for the army's raid the day before yesterday on the hideout of Abdullah Massoud, head of Taliban Pakistan, forcing him to blow himself up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Local official Mahboub Khan said that "the insurgents shelled sites indiscriminately to cause the greatest damage, thus placing the government in an uncomfortable situation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Suicide attacks and attacks targeting the army and the police in tribal areas have doubled two weeks ago, following the storming by Pakistani Army of the Red Mosque in Islamabad, where over a hundred Islamists were killed.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana confirmed that the European position on Syria is "very clear" and that the international community "had specified clear prerequisites which I expect will be respected by all, including Syria. The ball is currently still in the Syrian court."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a talk to be published tomorrow, Tuesday, by the organ of the Socialist Progressive Party in Lebanon Al-Anbaa, Solana stated he is happy about establishing an international court for the case of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's assassination, "although I hoped it would be established after a consensus about is reached in Lebanon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Solana congratulated the international investigations committee and its chair Serge Bramirtz on "the high professionalism and confidentiality with which it conducts its work."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He confirmed the support of the European Union of Lebanon's sovereignity, independence and integrity of its land, and said he was still committed to Lebanon "being free of external interference and united in its strife for democracy.  He added that the "Lebanese problem would be ideally solved through a Lebanese solution, but until that happens all those who wish well for Lebanon will continue to exhort foreign players to stop imposing their agendas and do whatever is necessary to encourage dialogue."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In regards to the presidential election events, Solana said "I believe that if they respected the constitutional process, the new president will be able to rule the whole Lebanese people in unity."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Lebanese Army in his opinion is very effective in the efforts carried out in Nahr Barid camp. "I was surprised by the great show of tenacity, particularly in the face of provocations," he said, and confirmed that "one of the positive aspects of these events is that it (the Army) is a rare example of Lebanese unity."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Humanitarian and Guardianship Problem Forced Applying Lebanese Legislation to Foreign Family - reading rate 1.72 per cent.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A social humanitarian case of a non-Lebanese family resident in Lebanon that suddenly lost its bread-winner and required a legal solution in the country where it resides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> She had two daughters from a Syrian husband who died some time after they were born.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After his death, she obtained custody over her two minor, non-Lebanese daughters from the Orthodox Armenian Archbishopric in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="5"> She filed an application with the Court of First Instance in Mount Lebanon, chaired by Justice John Kazzi and membership of Justices Alaa Al-Khatib and Nagi Al-Dahdah, to appoint her as the guardian over the management of her two non-Lebanese daughters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When the Court received the application, in considered the issue of whether Lebanese courts had the jurisdiction to decide on it, and how far was the Lebanese law applicable to it since all family members are non-Lebanese. It also considered the international jurisdiction of local courts according to the Principles of Civil Courts Act which specifies international jurisdiction cases for Lebanese courts. One of these is applicable to the application presented before the local court since the mother resides with her daughters in Lebanon and the application she lodged deals with the money the two underage girls have in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the basis of these legal facts that gave it jurisdiction, the court moved on from deciding on the form of the mother's application to considering its grounds and specifying the applicable legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In this context, the court made an interpretive judgement, stating in its decision "that the lawgiver resolved the issue of conflicting legislation by what is known as conflict rules. These are national rules created by the legislator or the judge, but they do not provide direct solution to the presented problem and its role is limited to specifying the applicable legislation as the most appropriate and most applicable one for deciding on the relationship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It was of the opinion that "Lebanese legislation, like many foreign legislations and international accords, relies on the persons's nationality for support in family law cases, and in this domain imposes the application of the law of the litigant's country."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> It considered this methodology to be the traditional methodology in dealing with issues caused by special international relationships, but that the progress in this type of international relations led to other resolution methodologies alongside the traditional one. One of these is the directly applicable laws methodology which precludes the application of the traditional methodology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> It explained that "directly applicable laws are equally applicable to internal legal relations and to international legal relations, regardless to any outside element, because the case it deals with touches on the social, moral and political fundamentals of the state of the considering judge, making it impossible for him not to apply them. It provides a direct resolution to the presented issue without specifying the applicable foreign legislation, and as such necessitates the application of the principles of direct internal legislation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> It touched on "the Lebanese sectarian system which resulted in a multiplicity of Lebanses Family Laws, so that each denomination subscribes to its own legislation, such as Act of 04/02/1951 which is applicable to all members of one denomination, namely Christianity,"</seg>
<seg id="13"> as well as regulating the principles and conditions of guardianship over Christian minors' finances. It deals with an issue that touches the social Lebanese fundamentals which provide for the protection and care of this category on Lebanese territories regardless of their nationality."</seg>
<seg id="14"> According to the above, the applicable legislation in guardianship applications as adhered to by the applicant is the Lebanese legislation, and specifically the Act of 1951.</seg>

<seg id="3"> After a period of medical treatment in Paris, the Free Patriotic Movement activist Mark Hoayek who was injured in the January 23rd events returned to Beirut.</seg>
<seg id="4"> He was welcomed at the airport by the representative of MP Michel Aoun, MP Chamel Mozaya, MP Abbas Hashim, the political communications official in the Movement Gibran Basil, Dr. Bassam Hashim, the Hoayek family and supporters from the Movement.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> From the airport, Hoayek and those present went to Amshit Square, where they were joined by MP Walid Khouri. Mozaya said, "Mark came to prove to those retired in their palaces and secluded in their government houses; who pretend patriotism while being collaborators, and love of life while they are soul-catchers; those who preach freedom, sovereignity and independence while they are dependents; to those who pretend to protect the Christian community but cancel Good Friday; those who allege purity but have records full of criminality; that he has come to prove he loves life and loves Lebanon without limits. You are the patriot par excellence, the honorable Lebanese.You are the one who stood up courageously to the logic of hegemony. You are the one who rejected the return of militias to our areas and so became the role model to look up to in the Free Patriotic Movement.</seg>

<seg id="8"> "We, of the patriotic project, want to live in a sovereign free and independent country, in a country that fights the corruption, the corrupting, and the corrupted, and respects coexistence, " he added.</seg>
<seg id="9"> We want to live in a country that respects the rights of the citizen and protects him. To achieve all this we have to elect a statesman at the helm of leadership - not a thief, not a collaborator, and not an assassin.

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Why don't we make by-elections a new chapter in democracy's path, instead of settlements and recommendations?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Both general and by-elections revive the game of democracy, because they alone are the security valve for state and institutions, and a proof for the vitality of Lebanese pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Recommendation, even if done in good faith, does not feed democracy bread, abolishing people's choices and rights. We have no right, and especially in the inappropriate conditions and critical situation, to abolish principal stations. Nothing prevents us, no matter what the considerations, from progressing in peaceful practice of democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> There are countries steeped in democracy, such as Belgium and Australia, which endorse compulsory polling because it considers voting not just a right but also an obligation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> There are other firmly established states that exhaust their nations with scores of elections annually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two months before the presidential elections, the best gift that the Lebanese can give themselves are the parliamentary by-elections, to be attended by the Lebanese in the spirit of civilized competitivness that proves their maturity and avoidance of street language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In these conditions when verbal exchange reaches its height, it is necessary to remind of the benefits of elections.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The biggest benefit is getting to know the real political weight of the political parties and movements, whether in the North or in Beirut.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Parliamentary elections alone give an indication as to the true size of this or that team, which prevents heroisms on this side, or deflations and inflations on that. And each team can prepare itself for the upcoming general elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This democratic exercise in difficult and hard times will prove to the world that the Lebanese are able to cut off any conspiracy against its system, its characteristics and its liberties, and that it is qualified to triumph over any terrorism, no matter what its source, particulary if its goal was to enlist Lebanon in the club of dictatorial countries, or those that suffer from the chaos of internal divisions and foreign interference.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Blair Launches Stinging Attack on Absurd British Islamists</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday, the Sunday Observer newspaper reported that the British Prime Minister Tony Blair launched a stinging attack against what he called absurd British Islamists who, he said, have nurtured a false sense of grieviance that they are being oppressed by Britain and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Blair, who has resigned his post last June 27 warned that  Britain is in danger of losing the battle against terrorists unless mainstream society confronts the threat.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The paper mentioned that Blair's remarks, in which he also attacks some civil liberty campaigners, were made in a documentary recorded last Tuesday on the eve of his departure from Downing Street, and will be broadcasted by Channel 4 on Monday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Blair was quoted in the program as saying that the idea these people propagate is that Muslims in this country don't have the freedom to express their religion or their views, while the fact is that the Muslims have far more freedom in this country (Britain) than in most Muslim countries,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Blair added that "we are fighting this battle incorrectly which makes it difficult for us to win, because we are not standing up to these people and saying, "It's not just your methods that are wrong, your ideas are absurd. Nobody is oppressing you. Your sense of grievance cannot be justified."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Blair held out the example of the overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan - criticised by Islamists as an example of the heavy-handed imperial West oppressing Muslims - to highlight unfounded claims of grievance.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He asked how is it possible to claim that Afghanistan's Muslims are being oppressed when the Taliban 'used to execute teachers for teaching girls in schools'.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Return of the Axis Policy</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> King Abdullah's visit to Sharm Al-Sheikh directly after the Quartet Summit ended a period of estrangement and coldness in the Egyptian-Saudi relations. It resulted from their disagreement about the role each played in the Palestinian cause; the role of each to influence and be influenced by it, as well as from Mecca's monopolization of the Mecca Agreement without inviting Cairo to participate. This was construed by the Egyptians as an insult to their long-term diplomatic and political role in the give-and-take relationship with the Palestinians. They decided that what Riyadh did was to kidnap a regional project.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We won't talk to what was done in practice to make the Mecca Agreement fail, as we are supporters of agreements not dissention.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is important now is that the Egyptian role is back at the forefront. President Mubarak proposed the Hamas-Fatah dialogue intiative in order to reach a state of consensus that will oust the Palestinian cause from the crisis it found itself in as a result of the illogical and immoral infighting on the part of Hamas. This is what Mr. Heikal said in his latest intervention about the Palestinian cause. But this dialogue requires a stage of catching breath and mending filial wounds, of concessions on both sides, before reaching the negotiations table.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The proposal is popular in Arab political circles, and is met with reservation by the Authority's leadership which wants to burn bridges by announcing a policy of dismantling through early parliamentary and presidential elections. That is a final divorce from political action, and although we differ with it ideologically, it has some influence in the Palestinian political life, and trying to pull it by the roots through the logic of law is going to be very difficult and risky.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Palestinian situation at the moment needs special mediation, one that has influence on both side. It should foremostly delay Mr. Abbas' request for international forces to supervise the Strip, because it will drag the Palestinians into the suicide circuit, which is the final liquidation of the Palestinian cause. This is what the United States of America and Israel want, because placing Gaza under international control will open the door to the old project of handing Gaza over to Egypt and the Bank to Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Palestinians need to be patient to reach the coast of the Arab initiative.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A source in the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said Friday that the mediation Middle East Quarter will meet in the capital Lisbon on July 19. This might be the first meeting to be attended by the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the Quartet's envoy.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The mediation Quartet includes the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As US Secretary of State State Condoleezza Rice is visiting Portugal on that day, it is expected she will attend the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Diplomatic sources mentioned that Tony Blair, who was appointed by the Quartet on June 27th, which is the day he resigned after 10 years in power, might also participate in the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The source at the Foreign Ministry said, "I am not sure yet, but I believe so, yes, that Blair is coming," adding that the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov might also attend.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In Washington, a spokesperson for the US Department of State Sean McCormick said he could not confirm there would be a Quartet meeting in Lisbon next week.</seg>
<seg id="8"> "I have not heard that all of the final arrangements and final agreements have been made for one," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> An EU official in Brussels said the meeting in Lisbon was not likely to involve Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, as talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were progressing.</seg>
<seg id="10"> "The Olmert-Abbas track is going well, the idea is to let that run and not disturb that," the official said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Olmert has said he expects to meet Abbas early next week to discuss, among other things, Israel's gesture to free 250 members of Abbas's Fatah faction from jail.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Israel holds about 10,000 Palestinian prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Quartet's meeting will also be its first since Hamas captured Gaza from Abbas' Fatah movement in June.</seg>
<seg id="14"> That transformed the Palestinian political and security landscape, effectively dividing the Palestinians between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Quartet last met in Germany on May 30.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Diplomats have told Reuters that Blair has sought a broader role since his appointment  as Middle East envoy, one that would give him more direct involvement in peacemaking.</seg>
<seg id="17"> "The Quartet will not give him a free hand, but Blair is a huge political figure and will to a certain extent do what he wants to do," said the EU official.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Quartet had defined Blair's role as raising funds for the Palestinians, building their ruling institutions and promoting their economic development.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Privately, politicians in both Israel and the Palestinian Authority display little optimism about the prospects for resuming negotiations on a Palestinian state.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Olmert is deeply unpopular and in a poor position to make concessions that Abbas is seeking, while the Palestinians are hobbled by the division between Fatah and Hamas, the West Bank and Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Yet the western powers are keen to see more stability and U.S. President George  Bush, whose tenure has been marked by problems in Iraq, has reaffirmed that he would like to see a Palestinian state by the time he leaves office in 18 months.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Officials said that Niger's prime minister and military chiefs will meet neighbouring Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Sunday to discuss cross-border cooperation against Tuareg-led rebels in Niger's desert north.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The rebel Niger Movement for Justice has killed at least 36 soldiers and taken dozens hostage since launching an insurgency in February to demand greater autonomy for the vast region around the ancient Saharan caravan town of Agadez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The government refuses to negotiate with the group, saying they are drug traffickers and common bandits, but has called on its neighbours to try to stop the flow of weapons, fuel and food thought to be reaching them from other Saharan armed groups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Some officials and civil society organisations in Niger have accused Libya of supporting the insurgents, who have also targeted mining interests in a region which contains some of the world's largest uranium deposits as well as reserves of oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The delegation has not gone to ask Algeria to play any sort of mediation role, as was the case in the past, but to explain the situation and ask its authorities to bolster border security," one senior military official in Niger told Reuters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Of course, if Algeria can convince the authors of these attacks that Niger will not negotiate and that they should put down their weapons, that would be very helpful," he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The delegation included Niger's Prime Minister Seyni Oumarou, Foreign Minister Aichatou Mindaoudou, armed forces chief General Moumouni Boureima, and President Mamadou Tandja's national security advisor General Abdou Kaza</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The group was received on Sunday by Bouteflika, according to Algeria's official news agency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Algeria has in the past acted as a mediator between Tuareg rebels in northern Niger and the government.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The light-skinned nomads, famed for their blue turbans, staged a rebellion in the 1990s to demand more autonomy from a black African dominated government following a brutal clampdown by the security forces in which scores of civilians were killed.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Most Tuareg groups signed a peace deal in 1995 which promised more development for the north, strengthened local government and promised the incorporation of thousands of former fighters into the security forces.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A Philippine diplomat said that North Korea's foreign minister, on a rare visit overseas by a senior Pyongyang official, promised on Sunday to abide by his country's commitment to end its nuclear weapons program.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Pak Ui Chun, who took office in May, told Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo that six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program were progressing well but gave no specific details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He also gave no timetable for disabling the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, which is at the heart of the crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Claro Cristobal, spokesman of the Philippine foreign affairs department said that during the meeting in Manila, Pak also expressed interest in working closely with the Philippines in three areas of cooperation, including energy and information technology.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Cristobal said Pak and Romulo discussed bilateral as well as regional and international issues, including developments on the Korean peninsula, which did occupy a good amount of discussion between the two sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "He said that his country is committed to the agreement signed in February to move forward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," Cristobal told reporters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> He continued by saying that "Minister Pak did a briefing to the Philippine side on developments in the six-party talks."</seg>
<seg id="9"> Minister Pak said that the six-party talks had been producing good progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Pak is in Manila to also attend the ASEAN Regional Forum later this week. It is the biggest security meeting in the region and will bring together the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and 17 dialogue partners, including the United States, Japan and China.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Philippines has offered to host a meeting of officials from the six parties - the United States, China, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas - involved in the Korean nuclear talks on the sidelines of the regional security forum.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But such a meeting is unlikely to take place in the absence of U.S. State Secretary Condoleezza Rice. Rice has said she needs to travel to the Middle East and is sending her deputy to Manila instead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Pyongyang had shut down its Yongbyon reactor under a February agreement reached during the six-party talks on its nuclear weapons program.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The latest round of nuclear talks ended this month without any target date for disabling the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="15"> On Monday, Pak was due to meet with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and tour business parks and cultural sites in Manila.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tunis, July 31 (Xinhua) The Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation issued a recent report for 2006 about the Investment Climate in the Arab Countries, in which it predicted an influx of foreign investment during this year into the states of the Arab region .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Excerpts from the report were published by the Tunisian paper As-sabah today, Tuesday, stated that the corporation based this increase in the share of the Arab states to internal attraction factors and external driving factors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The report added that in the field of internal factors, country-based promotion methods have improved and efforts are continuing to prepare the climate for investment by facilitating administrative measures and reducing their number, cost and time it takes to complete them. At the same time, the number of comprehensive services centers and provision of essential information is increasing; disclosure deadlines are met and the extent of their coverage is fulfilled in accordance with internationally agreed standards. In addition the Arab region is expanding in launching economic cities projects and their essential infrastructure consisting of airports, roads, ports and railways. A number of Arab states have also complied with completing privatization programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It mentioned external factors that contributed to directing investment towards the Arab region. The most prominent among these are the reduction in investment returns overseas in comparison to its counterpart in the Arab region, specifically in the field of natural resources such as oil and mining, in addition to the expanding market for some services industry activities, most importantly tourism, communications, various types of transport, and real estate investment boom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> What also contrinuted to the increased share of direct foreign investment in Arab states was the noticeable and continual growth of median Arab investments during 2006, especially in the tourism industry which has witnessed huge investments in excess of 25 billion US$ in announced investments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The report expected improvement in the Arab trading growth movement, especially the export of goods and services (except for Iraq, Somalia and Palestine). It justified this by the effect of continued increase on oil and metal prices and the improved entry of Arab exports into world markets as improved quality standards are applied to products and efforts increase to grow Arab exports.</seg>

This, provided that each of its members receives higher training in the method of dealing with people, and the methods of calling them to good and deterring them from vice.</seg>
<seg id="3"> They will have basic military training and uniforms, as is the case with the dress of the Mujahideen</seg>
<seg id="4"> In addition to excluding any person who has a previous conviction, and was employed by the Committee and also excluding any person who combines two jobs.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There are no objections to raising their salaries, considering first of all the importance of their work, and considering their fulltime work in one job. Under these conditions we can accept the work of the Committee.</seg>
<seg id="6"> What prompts me to say this, is the secret circular that the Ministry of Interior sent recently to the administrative regions (Emirates) and other relevant authorities, and which was communicated on internet forums, among them Al-Sahat</seg>
<seg id="7"> Its content prohibits the detention of any person in the centers of the Committee, and requires delivering them immediately to the police or other relevant security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It also prohibits questioning and extracting confessions by any method whatsoever. Members of the Committee who disregard this will be immediately restrained.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Thus, the Committee becomes another police but without authority, and their only task is to arrest transgressors. It is also best for it now to relinquish this role, and become dedicated to calling people to Allah in ways that are best, since the most important authority it was fighting for has been removed. Maybe then people would accept it as a missionary authority such as any other.. Yes,</seg>
<seg id="10"> this may harm some, where the Committee used to settle for an assurance, before releasing them. But this is also a fault the committee had blundered into, because it is based on the error of following people's shortcomings from the start.

<seg id="10"> I wish I, and others, could find answers to these questions!!!!! from the officials of Saudi (and not American) Aramco. Because [+any of the] sons of the dirty American people, as an employee amongst us receives a salary more than he, his father and his grandfather would receive in America. He is glorified and honored in the company more than any local. He is not penalized for any mistake he commits, which means that he is above the law and receives astronomical remunerations, and if a month's salary was distributed on seven poor Saudi families, it will be suffice them for a year. He is not meticulous in his work, but he is yellow-headed, blue eyed, does not pray nor fast, and his wife attends with him any celebration held by officials, who sign donation checks for the American poor !!!</seg>
<seg id="11"> Aramco is working on westernizing the Saudi woman. Its magazines are beginning to show the Saudi woman explicitly. The phenomenon of combating the Hijab is beginning clandestinely, while the obvious game is placing woman in jobs that require mingling or as a secretary for immoral directors.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Its policy has now departed from what it used to be. While previously it respected the nation, now it is disdainful towards it, and while it used to preserve the order of religious law now it violates it, and whereas it used to build schools for us from our money, it stopped and now builds for the Americans, and helps the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Aramco has an office to support charitable activities in the region, and 99% of the donations go to Al Awamiyah, and Qatif, to the disabled Shiite and the needy Shiite, although the schools of needy Sunnis are more than the Shiite many times over !!! The health programs in Sayhat, and the committees of Qudaih, the sport activities for the Shiite and everything that is dedicated for society is now transported from Aramco, via Al-Khubar and Dammam to reach Qatif, and only for the Shiite, will those in charge of the activities come up with an answer?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Is it an admission that the Oil is theirs and we are dependent on them as they repeat.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I leave you now with photos that were taken for the occasion of Texas' national day. They were circulated amongst Aramco employees with comments, and everyone who saw them became resentful against the company, knowing that there are many poor people who need money to be spent on them, and who are more important than the American Christians who support their government with taxes, to execute the humiliation, defeat and murder of Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Happy Birthday Texas. Happy Birthday Texas. Happy Birthday o' Texas. We are all your servants.</seg>

<seg id="1"> French Minister: Bush is behind September 11th Attacks??</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The website www.ReOpen911.info said that a senior French politician, now holding a minister post in the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy, had implied last year that US President George Bush might be behind the attacks of September 11th, 2001.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The website, which promotes conspiracy theories about the September 11th attacks, posted a video clip of the Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, Christine Boutin, in which she appeared to doubt that Al-Qaeda organization led by Osama Bin Laden had planned the attacks. Boutin's office sought to play down these comments.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She was asked in an interview conducted last November before she became minister, whether she thought that Bush might have been behind the attacks, and she said -I think it is possible. I think it is possible.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Boutin supports this opinion, by pointing out the large number of people who visit websites that doubt the official line about September 11th attacks on US cities.</seg>
<seg id="6"> She said: I know that websites that speak of this problem, are websites that have the highest number of visitors, and I tell myself that this public expression.. cannot be without any truth.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Boutin's office sought to play down these comments, saying that in a later segment of the same interview, she said: "I don't tell you that I adhere to this position", and this comment does not appear on the video that was posted on the website.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A number of websites have also posted the video clip in the last few days, and the story started to leak to major media organizations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Le Monde said in a headline: "Christine Boutin snared by her controversial suggestions about September 11,"</seg>
<seg id="10"> Will the minister change her views after she takes a post in Sarkozy's government; because an official is held responsible for his words, they are not considered ordinary talk that will pass lightly.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Scarcity of Gulf Tourists to Syria, Affects the Income of Flat Owners and Taxi Drivers.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The scarcity of Gulf tourists to Syria is affecting the income of flat owners, taxi drivers and retailers. Damascus (Sabq) Ayedh Al-Ghamidi: The complications which faced many travelers to Syria, as a result of falling victims to theft, cheating and fraud from gangs who made it their goal to entrap those of different nationalities, following them and hurting them, to the point of murder and plundering in some cases. Most of these incidents focused on citizens of Gulf countries, and caused them harm.</seg>
<seg id="3"> These repeated incidents in the past periods, made many people and especially Gulf citizens avoid traveling to spend this year's summer vacations in Syria, as they used to do in the past few years, changing their destinations this year to other countries, in search of security for their lives and possessions, and to enjoy their summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Some Saudi newspapers published a number of cases, of people subjected to unwarranted imprisonment, and also some murder incidents inside flats, and others.</seg>
<seg id="5"> During Sabq's tour of the Syrian capital we met a number of people whose occupations are directly involved with tourists and visitors to Syria, and whose income and the vitality of their business activities during the summer are affected directly by tourists; the summer period is considered a hot season for them. Among those occupations are taxi drivers, owners of flat rental offices, owners of barber shops, as well as shop owners and retailers. Their statements unanimously agreed that this summer came extremely negative especially concerning citizens of Gulf States. A taxi driver says when we rode with him: You are the first Gulf passenger I get in a month, indicating that in the past year he was busy all day throughout the whole summer, with most of his customers from Gulf citizens. He confirmed that his income this year has been affected by the low turnout of Gulf tourists to the country this year.</seg>
<seg id="6"> An owner of a retail store confirmed the same statements saying: The low level of sales this year is because of fewer shoppers from Gulf tourists, who arrived in large numbers, and were keen on buying all kinds of merchandise when they came to Syria, to take back to their countries on their return.</seg>
<seg id="7"> As for some owners of real estate offices they said: While the summer period used to be a hot season for flat rentals, and it used to be difficult to get a furnished flat, now  the season has started more than a week ago, and most furnished flats this year are still empty. They are offered to the very few renters so far at the lowest prices.</seg>
<seg id="8"> An owner of a real estate office added: In the past years, the owner of the real estate office was the one who chose flats for customers, and the prices were very lucrative, but this year the customer is the one who chooses a suitable flat and names the price he finds suitable, and nevertheless the offices compete to attract him, because of the dearth of visitors to Syria this year especially from the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Every man no matter how long he stays healthy, will be carried one day by the harsh instrument of death.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Lebanese musician Marcel Khalife, took part in a concert with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, on the 14th of July in Liverpool, , in the center of  the Beatles' and John Lennon's city, whose airport is named after the late musician.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The concert was held in the Philharmonic Hall, at the conclusion of the annual five-day Arabic cultural festival in Liverpool, which hosts every year a well-known Arab personality in the domain of arts, and this year it honored Khalife.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He gave another concert at the St. George's Hall in Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In both concerts Khalife played the oud and performed vocal segments. He was accompanied by his sons Rami on the Piano, and Bashar on percussion instruments.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Arab Philharmonic evening included two parts, the first a piano concerto composed by Lebanese Abdalla El-Masri, followed by an Andalusian Suite for oud and orchestra composed by Marcel Khalife, which included the pieces: Al Zagareed , Granada, Kadouka Al Mayass and Ya Banat Iskindiriyah</seg>
<seg id="8"> Maestro Clark Rundell conducted the orchestra, and more than 3000 people attended these concerts to listen to this new music.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Khalife said that Liverpool mayor Clark, received him for this occasion, and in an address welcoming the Lebanese musician, the mayor considered him one of the modern composers whose music express humanity in its transparence and universality. His participation with the Philharmonic Orchestra in Liverpool has left a big and deep impression on our souls, the mayor said.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Carthage Festival Biased to its Countrymen this year?</seg>
<seg id="3"> The amphitheatre of Carthage was built at the beginning of the 2nd century AD, and witnessed many alterations during the third and fourth centuries, before it was destroyed in the year 439 by the Vandals. The circle of its auditorium whose diameter extends for 106 meters is supported on the slope of the Odeon hill, while its length covers more than 50 meters. The niches of its skene were adorned with giant statues while the whole structure was built with white marble and kedel limestone.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It seated more than 11000 spectators, but a large section of it was destroyed, then it was gradually covered by rubble.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In 1904 it was excavated by the researcher Gauckler.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since 1967 it was restored to become the venue of Carthage International Festival, which is one of the defining summer activities in the Tunisian cultural scene. The festival is in its 43rd year, which will start tomorrow Saturday and continues until the August 16th, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This year's festival will see a concentration of Tunisian art performances, especially after issuing decisions requiring that 60% of performances in all festivals should be Tunisian.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The most important Tunisian contributions will have the signatures of Saber Al Robai, Soufia Sadok, and Latifa Al Arfawi. These appear to be shows that were postponed from the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9"> For other shows, there will be an evening for Moroccan artist Gad al-Maleh on July 31st.</seg>
<seg id="10"> As for Arabic shows, the festival will program a part of them in agreement with Rotana Company, as became usual in the last three years. This trend, however, is meeting with strong opposition especially from the local press, in view of the confusion that has become routinely expected, by announcing a number of names, then changing the listing in the last minute or even a little after that.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The festival -managed this year by Mr. Mohammed Raja Farhat- will produce the opening and closing ceremonies, which is a custom it has maintained for years.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The opening ceremony will be dedicated to presenting samples of musical and folk literature heritage in a modern interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The closing ceremony will be dedicated to honoring a select number of great talents in Tunisian music, whom we have lost recently, and it is enough to mention the great musician Ali Sariti and the late musician Abdulhamid Belalgia and others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> It should be pointed out that Tunisia celebrates this year, the 50th anniversary of the republic, and the evening show on July 25th will be consistent with this event, where a many national songs will be presented, by a selection of well-known Tunisian voices, among them: Lutfi Bushnaq, Sonia M'Barek, Shukri Bozian,  Soufia Sadok, Laila Hajij, Dirsaf Al Hamdani and Rihab Al Sagir</seg>
<seg id="15"> The working team for this evening show will be managed by the composer Hammadi Ben Othman.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Mr. Ahmad Ashour, conductor of the Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, will lead the orchestra, which will be infused with a number of Levantine instruments, and some of the most skilled musicians in Tunisia.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Weddings in Guelma, Between Trailing Fashion and Surmounting Tradition</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Weddings in Guelma, between trailing fashion and surmounting tradition, Weddings in Guelma, between trailing fashion and surmounting tradition</seg>
<seg id="3"> In yesterday's episode I said that the groom's father or one of his relatives spends a whole week on horseback inviting people to attend his son's wedding. But today with the current progress and blind fashion, this tradition, which used to increase social ties, has changed. It is now replaced by decorated paper invitations that are sent by post, fax or delivered by hand. There are also telephonic invitations without having to move, even if the invitee was a few meters away, in the same neighborhood or village.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As for the rituals of serving food to male and female guests, these changed as well to suit the fashion. Men now serve food to women, while before the women's festivity was in a different location, away from the eyes of the men. This happens in the absence of ladies and those with golden fingers, whose time is now dedicated to applying cosmetics, hairstyling, polishing nails, and changing the flowing and transparent clothes every hour, in addition to non-stop dancing to the music of the DJ's equipment. Then the tables come to them, laden with food and dessert, and carried on men's hands. This would have never been accepted by yesterday's men who were used to women preparing the food, while they were content to eat and chat.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Even the evening festivities, they used to be held in the open air, in front of the groom's house so that old and young should rejoice and be merry to the music of zurna, ney, and drums, but today moved to wedding chambers and halls. These are rented for close to five million, and are closed so that you only hear from them the noise of the DJ, blasting the hall with bands that have nothing to do with singing, and words that hurt decency and spark ridicule. The prodigality and wastefulness reached their extreme, and even wedding crockery is now made of plastic and other materials so that it can be thrown away immediately after use; whereas previously, wedding crockery filled the houses of large families and was used by neighbors and relatives. All this increased the expenses, weighing down the groom and his family with debts, which he has to pay back for many successive years.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The change even came over the rituals of the wedding night, and instead of the married couple spending their night at the family home after the end of the evening festivity and the departure of 'outside' guests -as they call them here- so that only the families of the bride and groom are left, now everyone prefers hotels, renting a room there at high prices to add to the other burdens.</seg>
<seg id="7"> And even the food is no longer only couscous, sherba soup, or shakhshoukha (meat and vegetable casserole served on freshly baked flat bread); they are replaced instead by the sweet tagine or olives tagine and other foods.</seg>
<seg id="8"> And about this change which came over the traditions of the Guelma wedding, my uncle Mohammed, an old man of eighty, said after a sigh, as if he was returning back to the days of his youth: Alas, on the old days and their weddings, which were held for seven days, in our times there was purpose, blessing and modesty.</seg>
<seg id="9"> My uncle Mohammed elaborated telling about his wedding day: I was 17 at the time when my father married me off. You know that while the wedding was celebrated I was harvesting wheat, and I only rested on the day the bride arrived. I have never seen her before, except on the wedding night and despite this our companionship lasted to this day. Because there was the intention of binding a cohesive family, where love and happiness reign, unlike your generation, where you marry in summer and divorce in winter.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Hajja Fatima, 76, said when we asked her about the weddings of the old days: Our opinion concerning our marriage was not important, and this was not only the case for the bride. Even the groom was not consulted whom to betroth, because the parents at the time were the ones who chose the groom and even the trousseau which the bride took with her to her married home; they also set the date for the wedding.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Everything was simple in our days. The bride's price never exceeded 500 centimes, and the trousseau was a full length veil (Hayek) and a small bag containing a pair of embroidered dresses. As for the wedding, it was celebrated over seven days and nights with traditional Rahaba singers, drums, zurna and firing guns into the air. As for the food, the main dish in the weddings of the old days was couscous and grilled semolina dumplings (rafeis). She said that at her wedding, her husband slaughtered 24 male sheep to feed the guests, saying that these days were unforgettable. Praise Allah, we lived in harmony and happiness, and we did not have any problems like your generation, who despite all the prosperity they enjoy have no stability. What we call high level of celibacy between young men and women is only a testimony to the fear of the unknown before embarking on marriage.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Arab Elections. In developed countries, candidates for general elections are subject to criteria that aim at advancing those who have competence, academic and educational credentials, and first-rate curriculum vitae, to stimulate the role of legislative councils in serving the homeland and its citizens, which in turn serves the stability of the state.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Whereas the general elections in Arab countries, are a democratic performance, played on the theatre of regimes, in order to advance the bottom members of the loyalist parties to the seat of the council, through forming protected lists it supports for winning, regardless of their academic, educational or humanitarian credentials, and even if they harbored the interest of their pockets more than the interest of the homeland.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The methods of collecting votes varies from one candidate to the next. We see one pitching up tents, showering with provisions, bringing in the water pipe, and sometimes even musical groups. Another one tours the election regions, where he passes a house in mourning and unwillingly weeps for the deceased to access the votes of his family, and perhaps the vote of the deceased himself. Then he moves on directly to a wedding hall to congratulate on the nuptials of another voter.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Some may resort to inventing propaganda methods for their election campaigns, such as distributing pieces of sweets with their name and picture. This might put them in danger of elevated blood sugar levels if they fail in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Others insist on contesting the election although they are certain of not winning, wanting to influence one candidate to benefit another behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Most candidates of Arabic tongue, cannot think or express themselves, but they still mount the platforms and pulpits to issue statements about providing work opportunities, increasing salaries, and free education. Their words make us miss the statements of Al-Sahhaf about the American infidel soldiers 'Uluj' (wild donkeys), although Al-Sahhaf did not commit the crime of assassinating the Arabic language.</seg>
<seg id="8"> And as soon as the elections are over, the candidates themselves unsheathe the sword of taxes to decapitate the poor. Then they sleep after gorging on spices and plentiful sources of the good food, while around them the hearts of those with limited incomes crave the strips of animal hides and the slivers of salted meat.</seg>
<seg id="9"> As for the presidential elections in our democratic countries, which are called the fast food elections, these are the elections that turned the citizens into mummies, going submissively to the ballot boxes to generate an election victory with a rate of 99%, a percentage that is not achieved by saints and holy men.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The occupation authorities deny little Aseel the realization of her dream to represent the children of Palestine in a festival of popular Dabkeh dance in Qatar. Salfit -Maan. Aseel sighed fervently, with tears rolling down soft cheeks that are covered with natural blush, adding beauty to the innocence of a childhood that the occupation deprived even from its simplest human rights.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Aseel is a dreamy child, overflowing with vitality and activity. The fourteen-year-old loves the world, is enamored in its beauty despite the black days her people are experiencing. Aseel is a member of a local Dabkeh group in the city of Ramallah, where she excelled and mastered her role. She was driven by her hope to take part in a festival where she can show off her talents and artistic abilities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At last, the chance came to Aseel, to travel to Qatar with her group, to perform shows there, in addition to another show in the city of Amman. Aseel's world could hardly contain her happiness; she ran throughout the house, kissing her parents and siblings: "My wish has come true, I will travel to dance the Dabkeh, and show the heritage of my land to the public of the Gulf." she told her father.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But Aseel is a child of parents who have identity cards issued in the city of Gaza, and live in the West Bank. Her family home is in a village near Qalqilia. The land of her father, and grandfather is many hectares and hundreds of olive trees, with roots reaching deep into the earth and branches that embrace the sky, to bear witness that Aseel and her ancestors existed here, and they will stay.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In a homeland torn by the occupation, the people of Gaza are punished with the obligation to obtain exit and coordination permits from the occupation army, in order to return to their places of residence in the West Bank, otherwise they would be deported to Gaza, and wouldn't be able to return to the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Aseel's father applied to the civilian liaison office in the occupation army, with a coordination application for his daughter, so that she can leave with her group, but the occupation authorities declined Aseel's application, and denied her from traveling with her group to take part in the Qatar festival.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Aseel returned to her home in Ramallah, cursing the occupation, the world turned darker in her childish innocent eyes, what was my crime?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Why didn't I travel with my group?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Why do they deny us the right to live like other people? Aseel said bitterly.</seg>

<seg id="4"> Mahmoud Al-Zahar, senior leader in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) reviewed several documents and figures which were seized from security headquarters. The documents prove the financial and administrative corruption in which senior leaderships of Fatah organization and the Palestinian Authority were involved.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In a political meeting held last night at the great mosque in Al-Bureij refugee camp in the center of Gaza Strip, Al-Zahar said: Salam Fayadh, is involved in corruption cases, and Hamas has documents to prove this, and it will present them in due course.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He confirmed that there are documents proving that Fatah Central Committee has questioned Salim Zanoun, speaker of the National Council, in the case of embezzling 2 million dollars from the coffers of the Palestinian nation.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He uncovered several cases of embezzlement and misuse of public funds, in figures that prove the involvement of a number of Fatah leaders, among them Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Authority President's adviser, Salam Fayadh, and Mohammad Rashid, the adviser of late president of the Authority Yasser Arafat , and others.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Al-Zahar said, in a meeting attended by a large gathering of locals and citizens: There are documents from the monitoring committee in the legislature, from May 1997, which prove that the financial corruption exceeded 326 millions, and that Abu Rudeineh had received 33,000 dollars from Arafat, as expenses for his daughters in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He explained that the Zionist occupation, had conducted an investigation, according to the documents, with an oil tycoons in the Zionist entity, named Ovadia Koko, who was paying half a million shekels annually to Mohammad Dahlan, and another half million to the Preventive [+Security Services] in the West Bank, in addition to 400,000 shekel to Rashid; they were all involved in fake sales invoices.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Hamas leader reiterated that the Authority's policy was based on monopoly, and it did not put out any of its transactions to tenders, especially in the commodities of oil, fruits and other merchandise. The aim was to distribute the profits between higher-ranking officials in the Authority's organs and institutions.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The documents detailed that the occupation refused to transfer an amount of one million shekel to another official, who was receiving it every month from the proceeds of Al-Mintar (Karni) crossing, adding that the report of the monitoring committee in the legislative council of February 2006, exposed the disappearance of 315 million dollars from the Authority's budget, while there was an ongoing inquest around the disappearance of another 700 million.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Al-Zahar read several documents and figures which prove the involvement of senior leaders of Fatah movement, and the Authority in crimes of embezzlement and misuse of power, throughout more than ten years.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Crocker's warnings to justify continued occupation and control over the oil cake. Crocker: The violence that will take place in Iraq is beyond any imagination. The US ambassador to Baghdad expects a complete collapse of Iraqi security forces under sectarian pressures.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Occupied Baghdad - The American Ambassador to Baghdad Ryan Crocker told the New York Times, that the premature departure of American forces from Iraq or their withdrawal to bases inside Iraq could lead to a sharp increase in violence and result in killing thousands.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The newspaper said that Crocker's statements were made in an interview conducted with him on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The statements coincide with growing fears from Iraqi leaders, that the increased pressures on US President George Bush would lead to the premature withdrawal of American forces.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Iraqi leaders from different sects warned on Monday, that the premature withdrawal of American forces could drown the country in a total civil war.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The leaders were commenting on a separate report of the newspaper on the growing debate inside the White House, about a gradual decrease to the number of troops.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The White House denied the contents of the article.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Crocker said about the possibility of increased violence in the event of the withdrawal of US forces: We have to look at the consequences, and to those who say that we can establish bases in other regions of the country,</seg>
<seg id="10"> He went on: Yes we can, but there will be a possibility that the American forces will stand by as spectators while civilians are butchered by the thousands, this is not a pleasant possibility.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Crocker and the US military commander David Petraeus will present a report to Congress in the middle of September on whether the large increase in the number of American troops has succeeded in curbing violence, and whether political leaders in Iraq made progress on national unity.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The US Congress will conduct this week, what is expected to be an interesting debate on the future and financing of the war. This will precede an important report on Iraq, which the administration will present to Congress by July 15th.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Crocker said that he bases his warning on what he noticed since he was assigned to his post about four months ago, and on his previous experience in Iraq more than 25 years ago, in addition to lessons learnt from his work in Beirut in the early eighties.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The New York Times reported Crocker as saying that the inability to imagine, made it impossible to foresee the violence that closed in on Lebanon as it slid into civil war.</seg>
<seg id="15"> He added: I am certain that what will happen here will exceed any imagination.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The newspaper said that Crocker cited several possibilities in his listing of the risks, which will follow the withdrawal of the American troops.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He said that these include the possibility that the 350,000-strong Iraqi security forces would completely collapse under sectarian pressure, and disintegrate into militias.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The voice of truth in the grip of the ignorant, Auchi: Release kidnapped journalist Alan Johnston for Palestine the cause and the homeland. The Anglo Arab organization joins a European rally of activists calling for the release of the British journalist.</seg>
<seg id="3"> London: A statement from the Anglo Arab Organization, said that its president Nadhmi Auchi has called on the kidnappers of British journalist Alan Johnston, to release him for Palestine the cause and the homeland.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The organization's statement pointed out that the repercussions of kidnapping BBC correspondents Alan Johnston are still causing many outbursts and protestations around the world, especially in the domains of word and opinion. This was not the only case, because it was repeated in Lebanon, Iraq and others, until the detention of the word became an Arab condition, and therefore an indictment against us, demeaning our civilization. Where, in fact, the free word has always been the most loyal friend to the Palestinian people regionally and internationally.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The statements comes in a large European campaign launched by an assembly of press, Islamic and European organizations, calling for the release of Alan Johnston.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Also taking part in this campaign alongside Auchi, are: Robert Menard, the chair of Journalists Without Borders organization; Dalil Boubakr, chair of the French Council for the Muslim Faith; Malik Abouzaid, chair of Federation of French of Arab and Muslim Origins; Abderrahmane Dahmane, chair of France's Council of Muslim Democrats and Mohammed Bechari, chair of the National Federation of Muslims of France.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Statement of the Anglo Arab Organization said that the word and its heroes was one of the strongholds on which Palestinians and Arabs build their hopes of uncovering the undisclosed and revealing facts.</seg>
<seg id="8"> And now, when a man of the word is kidnapped, what high price will this cost us in publicity and media?</seg>
<seg id="9"> What toll will the patriotic and national struggle have to pay?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Against this kidnapping, and whatever its motives and attributions, there certainly will be the accusation leveled against us, that we are peoples who do not distinguish between those carrying pens, and those who carry weapons, between those who search for the truth and who vie for stealing the homeland.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He added: we appeal to you to release the British journalist, we appeal to you to preserve the sanctity and respect of the word.</seg>
<seg id="12"> We appeal to you not to add to our old adversaries new ones; in fact you and us have to prove to them the justice of our causes. We know who the advocates of war are, and who the advocates of equitable peace are, and it is not fair to shuffle the cards, at a time when it becomes constantly clear to us who are our real enemies, and who are our friends.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In Britain there are voices that go out in protests for you, chanting in support of your rights, so don't confuse things for them, and give your real enemies the chance to gloat and invent lies about your positions. Release the British journalist Alan Johnston for Palestine the cause and the homeland.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Increase in Sardine Price a Result of Natural and Practical Factors; Moroccan Consumer is the First Victim.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The increase in sardine price is a result of natural and practical factors and the Moroccan consumer is the first victim. Moroccan coasts are experiencing an unprecedented and extraordinary condition, manifested in the huge decline of fish resource to the degree of scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="3"> And while the responsible authorities attribute this critical condition to new natural factors which affected the Moroccan waters and resulted in the migration of fish; expert fishing sources, on the other hand, explain this phenomenon with the over-exploitation of fishing resources in the absence of a plan concerned with surface fish. This made this resource vulnerable to vast depletion.</seg>
<seg id="4"> A number of international organizations, led by the FAO warned that these unacceptable practices, manifested in fishing large volumes of fresh edible sardine, and delivering them to fishmeal factories for processing instead of using only the spoiled quantities that are unsuitable for direct consumption.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Trucks coming from Dakhla harbor would wait in a long queue in front of Laayoune factories, before minister Laenser intervened to put an end to this crime by signing the national plan for surface fish. The plan was aimed at rationalizing fishing of these species on one hand, and on the other limiting the quantities of fishing allowed for each sector, which are estimated at a total of one million tons, considering that the total resource is estimated at 8 million ton, three million of which can be utilized. The plan came despite the resistance from lobbies controlling the sector, which are profiting from the status quo. Those lobbies were behind the failure of previous ministers in drafting such a plan.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the second after the octopus plan which was drafted after this species became threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It has become necessary for the ministry, which had set aside 80,000 tons in the national plan for surface fish for the production of protein-rich fishmeal, to work on imposing the rehabilitation of fishmeal manufacture, through eradicating factories that did not work on rehabilitating and modernizing their production methods, and on guaranteeing environmentally safe conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The newspaper Rissalat Al Oumma initiated the warnings against the exhaustive practices of many ships, and also against the trucks transporting sardines to fishmeal factories, within sight and earshot of authorities who remained silent, playing a spectator's role.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In another development, the deputy president of the central northern Atlantic fishing chamber, Kamal Sabri explained that fish traders now realize the importance of the local consumer market, which has known important developments in the last two years in terms of profitability, especially that these traders are now making better offers than the factories.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In a special statement, Sabri highlighted that the price of sardine, for example, went up from 1.60 to 2.50 dirham per kilo in the harbors of the southern region.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He added that the price of sardine in Casa Blanca has increased due to the scarcity of resource on one hand and the increased demand for consuming this foodstuff on the other. Prices now range between ten and 20 dirham per kilo depending on quality.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The story of this family can be summed up in the daily suffering of the 18-month-old Ferial. Her mother was carrying her, when we met her with the head of the committee for defending the ill. The mother's tears preceded her speech, she cannot believe what happened to her innocent child.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She was born with hemiplegia, a result of an abnormal birth, but despite this she had the ability to see. But after a few months it became clear that she is starting to lose sight in her right eye.</seg>
<seg id="5"> and after a journey of six months between hospitals and specialists, doctors assured her mother that treatment is possible, but in the meantime her eye started to redden. She took her to Oran hospital, where she was under observation for a whole week, then her eye started yellowing, after that it turned into whiteness that destroyed her eyes. This appeared after she underwent a medical test at a clinic in Oran, as she was asked to be treated as an outpatient.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Hemiplegia, losing sight, and daily suffering with an incurable condition. And after another journey of search, Ferial bin Abdullah's mothers was told that an operation would cost 32 million centimes per eye, which means a total of 64 million centimes. Only on person can perform this type of operation, and it is Mrs Hartani in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Here Mrs. Bin Abdullah stops, while the screams of her daughters increase from time to time, because of the pain that does not leave the child, especially when the sun shines on her face.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Here, Mrs. Bin Abdullah appeals to all generous donors or local authorities to look at her daily suffering since the birth of her child who hasn't turned two yet.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Daily suffering that was exacerbated by the difficult social circumstances of the family, because the father is +unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I only wish that sight can be restored to my child, and that this tragedy ends. This is what her mother says, after tears spilled on her entire face, as she pleaded to the compassion of anyone who cares to relieve the trials of this family and their child who is dying in silence.</seg>

<seg id="2"> A moment with summer and children. Summer has returned, and it is a suitable time for children to have fun and play under the sun, but do you know what problems your child could encounter during this?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Here you can identify these problems, without preventing the child from enjoying the holiday. These effects caused by sun radiation do not occur often, but they have to be recognized and prevented.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The human body maintains its temperature of about 37 degrees, regardless of all temperature changes around it. Thus the body ensures that all organs continue to work correctly. In contrast, large drops or increases in temperature may harm the body of man and child.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Then, how does the human body maintain its temperature?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The body achieves this through a balance between heat production and heat loss. The body produces heat through chemical reactions inside it, and this is summarized by the term metabolism. Through metabolism, foods are turned into energy. There is another source of heat in the body that is the work of muscles during exertion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand, the body cools itself by shedding excess heat, and this is mainly through heat radiation and perspiration from the skin.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The east is the cradle of religions and civilizations, but despite that it fell into the trap of underdevelopment. When it wanted to rise again, and change these miserable conditions, it found itself at a crossroad, not knowing which road to take, because each road has advocates promoting it.</seg>
<seg id="4"> And hence a conflict came about in the east between leaders of renaissance and renewal. Some of them looked towards the west taking everything it had without testing or separating the good from the bad, they also discarded everything they had of religious and cultural heritage.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Others looked towards Islam taking from it the fundamentals, frameworks, values and methods without turning their backs on elements the west has for economic and political renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And on the fringes of these two large movements, live two groups: A group who views Islam as a safe haven, invulnerable fortress and helpful guide for revival, with a strict interdiction against taking any renaissance tool from the west.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Then there is a hesitant and confused group, to whom the road is not yet clear, they don't know which direction to head, whether towards Islam or the west.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The dilemma between the first two large sides is religion, because the first group thinks that the west has advanced when it discarded religion, the authority of the church, and the tyranny of popes and clergymen. Therefore if we wanted to take the road towards renaissance then the only way is to discard religion and its values, adopting the new western values instead.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The second group was moderate and fair, taking this from Islam's moderation. It does not blame Islam for the current underdevelopment of Muslims. Instead, it strives to make Islam the foundation for rebirth, as it was in the first Islamic era, taking into consideration the best achievements of the west, as long as they do not infringe on faith or culture.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Building a strong civilization requires two wings: A moral spiritual wing, and a material wing, because a civilization that neglects the spirit, values and ethics while persisting towards material progress to the utmost possible, is a deficient civilization. It will fly until it soon falls from a great height.</seg>

<seg id="5"> The mayor stressed that the dilemma of informal stalls that are present arbitrarily on the city's streets can only be solved if hawkers and informal stall owners move to their own market, located in central area of the city. This will create a state of balance and simplify the movement of salespeople and shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Al Osaily added that the market was designed in a geometric and orderly form, and its proximity to the taxi stands of the city's neighborhoods and adjacent villages, also provides a good economic activity for sellers, and makes shopping easier.</seg>

<seg id="4"> Al Osaily, who was talking to our correspondent in Hebron, said: During the next months we will try to decrease this rate of loss, after improving the water network. This will be achieved through catching and charging those who steal drinking water to use for watering their produce.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Al Osaily confirmed that the city does not suffer a drinking water crisis, but it suffers from some supply faults from the Palestinian Water Authority. This is due to faults in their wells which supply the southern part of the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Al Osaily added, I personally follow the amounts of water we receive by reviewing the records and contacting the Water Authority. The daily amount we receive is 14-19 thousand cup.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Al Osaily pointed out that Hebron municipality is working on building two reservoirs in the areas of Jabal Jawhar and Jabal Abu Rumman in the city, in cooperation with USAID.

<seg id="4"> It is built from irregular stone using the ancient blocks of old buildings. Only one of these ancient building remains in the center of the village; it is known as the basilica, or Birgis crusader palace.</seg>

<seg id="6"> The walls of the monastery were built of chiseled blocks, on a stone base without foundations, and there is a press for raisin syrup and a grindstone. Between the chapel and the archeological site nearby, there is another olive press standing in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Considering the loss of springs which were very scarce, the residents of the monastery had to collect rain water in uncovered repositories and cisterns.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The visitor first reaches an 80-cm-high barrier which encloses the monastery building and the cemetery. The main facade of the chapel, was exposed to more damage than other parts, and only two large sections remain in the south and north.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the floor of the central courtyard used to be paved in mosaic, but it was removed, and only the outside edges remain.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The cemeteries consist of a cube-shaped building, constructed from large boulders. The room inside contains three large tombs, carved in stone, above each tomb is a small window, wide on the inside and narrow on the outside, where the greater bishops of the chapel were buried.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The mosaic on the floor of the diaconicum is a square image with an ornate frame, depicting many different species of birds, and small animals between the fruitful branches of vines, with baskets alongside them. In addition there are nine equal squares, depicting four girls, who represent the four seasons, each of them wearing what represents one season, in addition to a wild ox, a leaping lion, and a long-beaked bird. These artworks are thought to date back to the fifth century.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Another chapel east of the monastery, three kilometers away, inside a rocky area and an olive grove, has three entrances. On the lintel of the door we read in Greek, the year 605 A.D. Around the church there are the sights of a dead city.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Al Quds Medal for those who fight or oppose Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Al Quds Medal for those who fight or oppose Hamas. By Mohammed Mufid Al-Khalid.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Al Quds Medal, we never heard much about you, although the last seven years were full of the honorable deeds of freedom fighters, for which they deserve the best honors. Those who also deserve to link their honor with the name of Al Quds whom they defended with their blood, their money and the lives of their children. But as we say we are now in the age of wonders and overturned scales.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Within a very short period and after the incidents of Gaza, Al Quds Medals started pouring forth on some personalities who have nothing whatsoever in common, apart from fighting or criticizing Hamas. Today, as soon as you criticize Hamas for what it did in Gaza you will receive this honor, called Al Quds Medal, and from whom?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Directly from the President without delay or hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The person handing out these honors has neglected two important issues: the first is that this honor does not alter anything of the truth, and it will not fool our Palestinian people anyway. It will not turn a traitor into an honorable man, or a murderer into a freedom fighter. Samih al-Madhoun for example, will not turn from a murderer into a freedom fighter, and people will not forget who assaulted them, burned their houses and orphaned their children.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The second is that whoever gives Al Quds Medal has to be a protector of Jerusalem and the Aqsa Mosque, and not one who sells it and forsakes it. All of us know, and you in your own words, admitted and bragged that you are one of the engineers of Oslo, which squandered our rights, our lands and our Al Quds. In your policies you continue to squander the rights day after day, and commit the most severe forms of disrespect towards Al Quds.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The real honor is Allah's honor, then the honor of the people, and history, and it is on the scales of truth and sacrifice. The real Al Quds Medal was and is still given by the people to freedom fighters and heroes when they come out carrying the martyr over their heads, and declaring their love, pledge and loyalty.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Between Rafah.. And Karm Abu Salem. This entry is a response brother Mr. Mohammed Hammad's call, to make this a day of solidarity with those stuck at Rafah Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Six thousand souls, baked by the rays of the sun, and 28 souls that rose to their creators, complaining from the injustice of men.. and more on the way.</seg>
<seg id="4"> O' Allah, what is the crime of kneeling elderly men, and infant children, in the reckonings of despicable and dirty politics?</seg>
<seg id="5"> O' Allah, what is the crime of those, from gate to gate, sons of uncles, kissing bloodstained hands.. so that these hands can regain control over soil and lives?</seg>
<seg id="6"> My dear ones, what is their crime, to remain stuck for five weeks at Rafah Crossing without permission to enter Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Where are the agreements of sovereignty and the adherence to them (as they claim)... Why do they get lost between the reckonings of Hamas and Fatah around power.. and what power ?</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abbas is asking the Zionist entity to allow the entry of those stuck via Karm Abu Salem, and Hamas refuses saying that this is not on account of their condition.. but because Abbas knows that among them are some who are wanted by the Zionist entity.. And this operation means the return of Israeli direct control over the crossings (as if it didn't exist before); plain daylight cannot be covered by a sieve.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I wonder here, why doesn't the Egyptian government open Rafah Crossing, and allow those stuck to pass, instead of remaining there suspended between earth and sky.. Can't the Egyptian government do this according to agreements signed with the usurping entity?</seg>
<seg id="10"> I think it can if it wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Why do these people get lost in vengeful operations around inadequate power...Why don't we see an Arab movement trying to solve this problem, to preserve the lives of six thousand souls, who lift their palms in prayer to Allah, asking for release from imprisonment and support for their weakness.</seg>

Thousands of congratulations; it is the first time we get the first place worldwide in something, and we received it, with a high rate of 87%. There is nobody like us in the world, and we have no competition... but seriously people, what is wrong with the Egyptian government? It has provided us with everything, and we can have whatever we need.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Elections! There are no fairer elections, and they are transparent and pure, purer than milk.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Salaries! The Egyptian citizen is spoiled for choice, and does not know where he can spend his salary, I mean there is so much of it, it is sufficient for him and with lots to spare.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Health! How wonderful, health and hospitals are in Egypt! nothing like them among the hospitals of Europe and developed countries. You can even enter them missing an eye, a leg or a kidney, they fit you with another one without you saying or feeling anything.</seg>
<seg id="7"> I don't want to continue to say that the achievements of the Egyptian government are clear and straightforward, and we do not need to point them out. People! I protest and denounce this report. In fact, we should get the first place among the nations that are happy with their people. Also this rate of 87% is not ours, and is unfamiliar to us; we have a specific percentage that is well-known all over the world, we never deviate up or down from it, and it is the 99.9%. I don't know how this report gets its fake rates, or where it gets them from.. Maybe somebody pushed them on us.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Leaves of a life. Monday 07/23/2007.. Revolution Day.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the address of President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak celebrating the anniversary of that glorious revolution -and the expression is not mine, but it appeared on the screen with he address- the President spoke throughout the whole address to the effect that his regime is an extension of the July Revolution. This is not true, because the revolution ended completely with the end of the October War.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As the great Egyptian poet Sayed Hegab said yesterday: The revolution ended, when Mohamed Abdel Ghani El-Gamasy came out of the negotiation tent at the 101km crying and saying that President Sadat conceded more than was required by the exigencies of the military situation. ***On the same day, and this is an ongoing process which intensifies with every anniversary of the revolution, the official channels and government newspapers mount a violent campaign against everything the revolution represents.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I am not concerned here with my own opinions of the revolution and its achievement or with my personal position from Abdel Nasser, this eternal leader. The obvious question for any regular citizen: If this extinct despicable rule, which the regime's media vilifies day and night, is the source, while the current regime is merely an extension, as the head of the regime confirms, then why does the regime remain?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Of course, the achievements in the infrastructure do not serve as an answer to this question after the recent "revolution of the thirsty". But let us not worry; the infrastructure in the Marina Resorts are great and water is plentiful, praise be to Allah.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Al-Shabiba - Occupied Gaza. The last few days witnessed successive attacks from Hamas' security forces against a number of locations, shops, personalities and officials. This security campaign from Hamas movement against the institutions of the National Authority, their employees, families and weddings occurred in several regions.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The most important attack targeted the Al-Azhar Univesity, whose tendency is away from Hamas' dominations. It neighbors the Islamic University, but it does not raise the green flag, and it appears that it refuses to raise 'the white flag'. The attack was preceded by a threat to the President of the University to take down Fatah flags which are hoisted in some locations of the university.</seg>
<seg id="5"> And because the request was not met, it was attacked in an unprecedented challenge. Especially since Hamas had stressed earlier the sanctity of educational and learning institutions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, since the 'National Salary Day' Hamas' security forces tended towards escalation and intimidation, against those committed to the official government line, refusing Hamas' 'local government'. Some senior personalities in the official institution were targeted, and this is only a clear and lucid expression of the chaos which will increase as days go by.

<seg id="3"> I was halted by the comment of "Saheb Al-Kalam Al-Baki, Fares Al-Mamlakah" (Holder of the weeping pen -Knight of the Kingdom) about the theft of his works by a blogger.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I did not believe this initially, but I retracted, and started searching on the subject of intellectual property theft on Google. And I was horrified by the large number of over two million results, between protection laws, incidents, news and complaints.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I passed them quickly, and although I had heard about many of these incidents, I never gave them any thought until the brother "Saheb Al-Kalam Al-Baki", came and introduced me to reality, and this made me reconsider.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For more about the issue of brother "Saheb Al-Kalam Al-Baki", visit this link: http://fareselmamlaka.maktoobblog.com/</seg>
<seg id="7"> Theft is a huge issue denounced by religion and law, in fact also by decent souls</seg>
<seg id="8"> This action, even if it benefits today, will not do its perpetrator any good on judgment day, and perhaps he will be exposed one day, no matter how long or short it takes; there are many examples of this. I do not think that stealing is only limited to professionals and weirdoes, but it has become an enjoyable activity for reckless youth, and seekers of instant fame.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In addition, the matter has gone beyond this into our universities, schools, and even into information media, and government offices. It spread widely from employees to the educated elite, some of whom became prominent through this activity. As for trade and business, we can speak volumes; such actions occur day and night, and every second there is theft of ideas, inventions, and research papers, all over the world. The protagonists are intelligence people, professional thieves, political or educated elite, or business men.</seg>
<seg id="10"> And those are talent leeches, thieves of intellectual property, expand their business freely and despite the strictness of law. However, the deterrent of conscience was the main reason for the prevalence of these actions, especially since fame and prominence became an economic resource in a world where resources are scarce. Not one hour passes without the emergence of another new star, a great critic, and a sophisticated politician. Satellite channels, newspapers and magazines compete with these figures, to make the story of the day, in an age when there is no time for others.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Imagine.. then consider, imagine.. then Consider. Suheib Al-Falahi. Close your eyes... and imagine that you have died, and left your family and friends. And imagine that your soul is hovering over your house, looking at what your loved ones are suffering because of losing you.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Look at your mother... her tears constantly filling her eyes.. Your wife, how she is bereaved.. Your father, the way he lost you. Look at what your children are suffering... after you.. And look.. and look.. And imagine.. and imagine, looking and imagining takes long.. Then, open your eyes, and calculate with me, how many pains, and how many calamities have fallen on those you love as a result of your death...oh.. How hard it is to die... but it is our destiny.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After all that, consider, as you watch satellite television, and hear that there were 40 unidentified bodies found in Baghdad today. And as you move to another channel to see that 50 unidentified bodies were found in different neighborhoods of Baghdad, while a third channel plays down this daily news item, describing that 30 unidentified bodies were found today.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Now, and after you have heard these painful news, go back to imagining again... but imagine, as you consider the magnitude of the calamities that did not only hit those 40, 50, or 30 - despite all the pain they suffered under torture- but the calamities and pains descending on 50 families, each of them losing a father and breadwinner, leaving behind children who do not know what crime their father was killed for, and who will support them after this. And a mother who bemoaned and bemoaned her husband, who went out of their home a few hours ago, hoping to come back with what hey need.. But.. and you can imagine and consider this mother who set her two children in front of her, they were killed and they hadn't yet reached puberty. Tears are falling from her eyes, and her hands are not leaving their bodies, caressing them and kissing them, not knowing why they were killed. God help you, o' Iraq, God help you o' Iraq, for what crime were you killed o' Iraq. Perhaps what I mentioned has occurred to a family of those daily fifty, whom the medical examiner can no longer bear, and before that our souls couldn't bear. We do not know if the day will come when we will be one of them, since our description is Iraqis?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Allah only knows !!!</seg>
<seg id="7"> The disappearance of the Kaaba is easier on Allah than the murder of a Muslim. You have spoken the truth, o' Prophet of Allah. As for our blood and souls, they are no longer sanctified under this painful situation. 105 people were killed in one hour in Toz Kharmato, and 560 people were killed in Baghdad last month.. This means that 560 families were afflicted with tragedy last month. There is no power or might except with Allah. After all this you can go back to close your eyes, as you face the Qiblah in the middle of the night to pray: O' Allah, dispel for Iraq and its people the calamities that ensued on them...</seg>

<seg id="3"> It was the first time in my life I go to a camp.</seg>
<seg id="4"> And after a long 16-hour travel, and the horror of the train, which vanished after we arrived to Cairo; we arrived on Friday. The accommodation was at Mubarak International Youth Hostel, opposite the stadium. We were put up in a room for four, all of us from Alexandria, and I hurried to the bed next to the window. Then, we met the camp management, after that a meeting session with young men from three other governorates, Sohag, Aswan, and Beni Suef. The day ended, and of course, we didn't sleep, but went up into town. What a beauty! We were supposed to return at twelve, but why, we are Alexandrians, we returned at 3:30 a.m. Yes, sir. We heard a few words, but this is normal. From the second day until the end of the camp one pattern: Waking up at 7 am amidst terrible stifling weather. We were there in March but it was very hot; Morning exercise at the stadium from 8 to 9 am: Round the track, firm your stomach, relax your leg.. After that breakfast at nine, some fava beans, a piece of cheese, and two flat breads with a small glass of tea. The work starts from 10:00; we were divided into four committees: Organization, Environment, Assessment, and my Cultural committee. We set up an internal organization, and I was nominated as editor-in-chief for the committee magazine. I had a sweeping success with eleven votes, against four for Karam Al-Sohagi. Every day after that between 11:00 and 12:00, the committees presented a specific subject, political, economic, or social. We divided into four focus groups, and trained with an instructor in debate, research, and how to find information on the subject to present to the guest, who is a professor in his field. After lunch, from 3:00 to 4:00 and again from 7:00 pm onwards the work of the committees continued until 09:00 pm. Then there is a free tour in town formally until twelve and informally until 02:30 am; and of course, discussions with young men from the governorates and university professors which are fantastic.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Within the framework of projects proposed by the local committee of the National Initiative for Human Development in Tahala, the governor of Taza Province arrived on Monday July 23rd 2007 in Tahala, to launch the work on projects financed by the National Initiative for Human Development Fund.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Among the projects focused on: The project of building shops for hawkers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Following are the data sheet of the project. Location: City center, the local market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Target group: Hawkers in Tahala</seg>
<seg id="7"> Contents of the project: 45 shops, security center, toilets for men and for women.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Covered area: 323 square meters.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Source of funding: National Initiative for Human Development Fund (400,000 dirham). The Regional Budget (600,000 dirham) The urban district of Tahala (Land)</seg>
<seg id="10"> The expected timeframe for completing the project 4 months.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The contract was awarded to SEDEC Company in Témara.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Unit price for the shop is 22,200 dirham.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The general secretariat in the Prefecture will administer the supervision process.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The inauguration ceremony was attended by the head of the municipal council, and some members and representatives of the local committee for human development, members of the vitalization team for the Quds neighborhood and department chiefs.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Some citizens found it odd that their representatives were present despite the problems in the administration of local affairs in Tahala.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The question remains, how will these shops be distributed?</seg>
<seg id="17"> What are the criteria of assigning them?</seg>
<seg id="18"> And finally what are the chances of success for this project which has been planned in the absence of the people concerned?</seg>
<seg id="19"> The conditions for the success of a trade project is dependent on choosing an appropriate location.</seg>
<seg id="20"> So, is the empty space behind the local market suitable?</seg>
<seg id="21"> And will the local market gain popularity and receive interest that could contribute to the marketability of hawker shops?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Didn't an investor develop two shops in the same area for selling fish, then was forced to abandon his project?</seg>
<seg id="23"> And finally, who will visit shops that are located next to the biggest garbage dump in the city center?</seg>
<seg id="24"> When residents of Tahala city have to go to the local market, they make a thousand and one consideration about the offensive smells, and the swarms of flies surrounding the market. Did the municipal council in Tahala think about the health situation for these shops, or does it want to make the matters worse?</seg>

<seg id="5"> I felt that the place suited her a lot, but when I spoke to her she showed disquiet and boredom from this place. Meanwhile I know it, and met a number of officials there, but she did not know about that.

<seg id="3"> Towards establishing a completely impartial and independent Bureau for Financial Disclosure.</seg>
<seg id="4"> These are our honorable representatives, as they finish now the second session of the 11th legislative term. After rounds and campaigns of political discussions, which were mostly heated and only sometimes mild; they ended -praise be to Allah- with what they did, passing the General State Budget for the next financial year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I was really hoping that the law for financial disclosure will be passed, as it is one of the most powerful, and the most important tools for combating corruption in Kuwait. It will, no doubt, be a reason for establishing the principles of integrity, and transparence, and for preventing administrative, and executive transgression in all state sectors, whatever they are.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This law will be as a clear line separating clean conscience and honest integrity, from disgraceful fraud and administrative corruption.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Illegal profiteering is a detestable trait in any society, and it usually sticks to its owner completely. It permeates to become an integral part of him, and it helps create especially negative and awful class and social differences. These in turn could lead to discommendable consequences within the folds of society, apart from considering stealing government's monies and resources a legitimate right for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is really regrettable and shameful at the same time to delay discussing and passing this law citing the excuse of the National Assembly's busy work schedule, with inquiries and other items on its agenda.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I hope that we will not wait too long, and see the law of financial disclosure passed in the next term, and Allah willing in its first session this October, in other words before the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Finally we have to consider rationally, that the authority executing this law should be an impartial authority, absolutely and fully independent from government... similar to the reputable State Audit Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It would be nice if it was called (Bureau for Financial Disclosure) to become an important reinforcement to our free democratic society, and an important cultural mainstay for integrity and transparency in the state of Kuwait.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Although the residents of the western regions do not depend on tap water for drinking or cooking, and use filtered water instead, I still say: Consider for example that what happened in Manshiyet Bani Hasan, has happened - God forbid- in one of the upper class western regions of Amman, such as Deir Ghbar - and this is very unlikely, the unlikelihood of the distance between the two places multiplied by an astronomical number- Will the reaction be as it was with the first?</seg>
<seg id="4"> Of course, the picture would have been different in terms of the reaction, and the swiftness of solving the problem. Because the intestines of the highborn sissies will not tolerate the simplest germs, that get into the water despite the health precaution of water filters.</seg>
<seg id="5"> And of course, and as fast as the air-pump would pump water, a fat scapegoat would be presented to public opinion, in order to absorb the anger. Furthermore, private hospitals would roll out the red carpet to its callers of the afflicted because the costs of their treatment would be expensive. The municipality would move to dig streets without leaving holes behind, in order to upgrade the network of this street. Also the "digital" or neo-liberal ministers of this region would move quickly, simply because they reside there or in the nearby regions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Poor village of Manshiyet Bani Hasan, if only you had a working minister or a high-ranking official, the reaction would have been much bigger.</seg>

<seg id="1"> They Are Attacking Trees.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> They are attacking trees. On the main road which splits the city of Najran in two, we found that the region's municipality has chopped the ornamental trees.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It did not chop them down completely; they left the trunk and some branches, while they discarded their leaves, verdure and shade which had lasted many years.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The view has become very ugly, as if we were in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I don't think there is a clear reason for this action, because I found the chopped trees thrown in the middle of the road until they turned dry.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And even if there was a reason to do this, what is the benefit of leaving the trees in such condition?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Was their assumption that they will return to their earlier state?</seg>
<seg id="8"> .</seg>
<seg id="9"> I don't know much on the subject of planting ornamental trees, and whether it is possible for them to return to what they were before, if they were trimmed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> But the general view of the road is missing the beautiful green color and some of the coolness which these trees bestowed upon the road especially in the heat of summer.</seg>
<seg id="11"> What will they add?</seg>
<seg id="12"> I don't know.. all I know is that they are cutting the trees!</seg>
<seg id="13"> Another matter which the citizen and visitor to the region will sense, is the bad surfacing of the road itself, and specifically after recent projects where the road was excavated more than once.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The road is excavated once, twice and even three times and is not returned to what it was.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The road has actually become like glass, which cannot be restored after it breaks.</seg>
<seg id="16"> People complain daily of this road, to the degree that the municipality overlooks, or deliberately disregards this more than once.</seg>
<seg id="17"> A few days ago, I saw some equipment working to fill some holes in the road, as a form of indication that repairing the road and completely surfacing it, will only happen in the distant future, if at all.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Woman between Serving the Home and Man's Dominance.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Woman between serving the home and man's dominance.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Eastern societies are different in their customs and traditions from western ones.</seg>
<seg id="4"> And perhaps the greatest reason for the underdevelopment of eastern societies, is adhering to most these customs which have nothing to do with religion or ethics.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Among these customs, which prevail to this day, is the incorrect notion of woman; that she is supposed to be a servant in the home, starting with cooking and preparing food, to house cleaning, washing dishes, laundry and ironing. This is the reality in most countries of the Middle and Near East. Man does not know how to cook, house clean, or launder, or do any other house chore, he rather considers this the work of a woman, whether mother, sister, wife or daughter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A woman, no matter what her occupation was outside the house -I mean whether she was an employee, worker or holder of a higher degree- is supposed to be a good housewife. We see the working woman doing house chores when she returns from her work, and mostly prepares the next day's meals at night. As for holidays, they are the working woman's chance to catch up on chores that accumulated during the working week. If we made a calculation of a woman's hours of work outside the home, and added them to the hours of housework, we will find that the poor woman did not enjoy a single day off, not even once a year.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This relates to the woman who works outside the home; whereas the housewife, or the woman who doesn't work, also suffers by not enjoying any off day, and works from when she rises until it is time to go to bed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Meanwhile, Mr. Male, enjoys exemption from housework, and only has to work outside the home. When he arrives home he is the master who orders around, with all his wishes met. And if only he would be satisfied, or persuaded! On the contrary, we only find him complaining: He doesn't like the cooking, the laundry hasn't been done well, and it goes on with his flimsy allegations, as if he was dealing with a servant.</seg>
<seg id="9"> What is the reason for the prevalence of this phenomenon in most eastern nations. Is it a religious legacy, or a social conventional tradition?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Did men force this upon women? Or did women surrender themselves to men and made them masters?</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the view of religion, and according to what is legislated and confirmed for the masses and the elite, the man has the responsibility of managing the home. He either does it himself, or hires himself a servant.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Religion did not require a woman to do housework; furthermore, if the wife bore an infant, the father has to provide a wet nurse, and if the infant was nursed by its mother, then she has to agree to this, or demand a fee for nursing. This is also the case for a nanny.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The issue then is merely a product of customs and traditions. Perhaps what helped spread it was poverty; in most eras which elapsed on humans and even in this age, because the husband cannot afford the fee of a domestic worker, since he is barely able to provide food. And since woman in most cases was not working, she showed solidarity by cooperating with him; he works to provide a living while she works at home. This was a good step from woman for helping man, but this help was exploited by men in following generations and they made it a social law.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This was not only limited to the poor, but extended to the rich as well, and man began to feel that it was his right to be served by woman and that she should provide all his domestic requirements. Can woman now, after she conceded this to man, and accepted it, can she get out of this dilemma, and will man realize that he wronged woman?</seg>
<seg id="15"> This depends firstly on the woman herself, because she has to demand her right in equity with man, and secondly on the man, to understand this issue and truly feel that woman is exactly his equal. And since we are calling for complete equity between man and woman, we also call on men and women participate together in daily responsibilities inside and outside the home, as is the case in most western countries. Then, neither man nor woman becomes master in the home, rather both become partners in everything.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Institutional Work</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Institutional Work</seg>
<seg id="3"> There are many active leaderships producing loads of creativity in many academic, vocational, artistic and political fields.</seg>
<seg id="4"> They establish rules, and come up with theories, and draw out future visions, according to sound and deliberate plans. These programs and plans are time consuming and require great efforts, and huge funds. Then there are the mechanics of executing these projects, plans, ideas, proposals and theories in reality.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The greatest effort, extreme pains, and huge funds were expended, to implement them in actuality within a timeframe which might be long or short. But before long, and suddenly within the space of a few hours, these ideas and plans disappear, this proposal is removed or the activity vanishes.. and when we try to find reasons</seg>
<seg id="6"> for removing these programs, plans and projects it becomes clear that the leaderships, who had adopted the idea were gone for one reason or another.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Among the examples, is the idea of activity which was extinguished with the departure of the honorable professor Dr. Mohammed Al-Rashid; the idea of pioneering schools which vanished with the departure of some supervisors in the ministry,</seg>
<seg id="8"> and the idea of learning resources, on which the ministry spent millions of Riyals, and which until now was not optimally implemented, in proportion to the amounts spent on it.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Also the idea of e-government which his highness Prince Muqrin bin Abdul-Aziz adopted, and was interested in implementing. For this, he held many press and administrative meetings with directors of all civil and military sectors, and many businessmen participated in these meetings</seg>
<seg id="10"> in Medina Region. The idea did not disappear with the departure of Prince Muqrin but the interest in it hasn't been as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Also among the new ideas, is the idea of new the Post, with the slogan (address without detours), which the Saudi Post Corporation adopted and started implementing it in many neighborhoods of Medina. The distribution of boxes and fixing them on houses has started, with 60% of Medina's neighborhoods now covered.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In my view, this idea was not studied thoroughly. Many of our writers have written about it in the local newspapers, as it is more sensible to survey the residential neighborhoods, only to assign codes, and then offer postal service to those who want it. What happened, in contrast, was an obvious squandering of the corporation's funds.</seg>
<seg id="13"> And anyway, we need disciplined collective institutional work... This institutional work is what provides a future vision for all programs, projects, or systems and decisions, then the suitable ones are approved, after exhaustive study from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In such institutional work, programs and projects are not affected by the departure of one person or the arrival of another, because work is regulated according to specific mechanisms, as well as clearly observable controls and strategies.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Fatigue and Exhaustion</seg>
<seg id="3"> A person needs a certain amount of exertion to improve his or her performance, but extreme exhaustion can have many negative results.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Exhaustion is a condition of weariness, because of illness, physical, or mental fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Fatigue and exhaustion are among the dangerous elements that can result in the destruction of civilizations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Because one is not supposed to become fatigued and exert gigantic efforts at work without rest.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The need for rest after work is as important as food.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Fatigue affect a person with lack of endurance, the circumstances become overwhelming and everything grows massively out of proportion and dwarfs one opposite them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Fatigue is also the main opening for physical illness.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Because fatigue and exhaustion, lead to the increase of hormone levels in the blood stream. Among these hormones is adrenaline which raises blood pressure, and there are also hormones that inhibit the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Fatigue may also be related to other illnesses such of gastro-intestinal disorders, flu, herpes and some types of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Among the symptoms of exhaustion are: increased heart-beat, elevated blood pressure, nervous tension, mental lassitude, and lack of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="13"> To reduce exhaustion, it is advisable to eat foods containing sugars at breakfast, and limit the ingestion of laxatives which cause the loss of vitamins A-D, and therefore cause exhaustion and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Are you well?</seg>
<seg id="4"> -I am well, my son, Praise Allah, for whatever Allah sends. Our destiny. -Take care of yourself, ma, Allah willing, Allah will find a way for us soon, Amen. Send regards to Gaza, and tears flow from both, and yearning eats up soul and body. Ahmad hangs up his cell phone and pleads the loss of all sides to Allah.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Another calls his father, as tears wash his face and cleanse it, and many lost their friends on the crossing of death. Others were born, without birth certificates, while we still distribute false legacies, fight over the crumbs of the Zionists, and run after them, listening to their decrees and implementing them to the letter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Gaza how poor you are, I don't know what further awaits you. Even when we settle within you, the relatives' hearts are still attached to those who are stuck outside you, tortured on this earth, and drinking the cup of humiliation and bitterness every day.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Dollars and pounds are of no use, before a generation of pride and self-esteem, a generation who are destined for slow death, in the unwavering Egypt, and in the vast deserts, after their patience was exhausted, their yearning and passion stirred, and there was nothing on earth equal to their longing for Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8"> To the people stuck on death's crossing: I had predicted, at the beginning of this summer, the opening of a new amusement park, with more advanced facilities at the gate of the crossing. Here is the prophecy coming true, and with the increase in players, the excitement is enhanced, how do the fatigued die on the road?</seg>
<seg id="9"> in silence, and with a tremble shaking their sides, aggravating everything in them. If only there was an ear left to listen to the truth! Words fail us, and so does all the language of the dictionary.. fie on us, ahead of our rulers, we are no longer able to do anything. All of us are prisoners of our delusions, and prisoners of extinction. May Allah's wrath descend with every sunrise and sunset on whoever caused the tragedy of those sad ones.</seg>

<seg id="6"> The pictures kept coming to me, but I still held myself together. I remained thus for a long time until tears announced my defeat, slipping lightly towards the waves to tell them my true nature.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The waves approached until they touched my feet, and they kept caressing and hugging me tenderly, wiping away the waves of sadness drawn on my face, and with their salty water erasing all bitter pictures and cleansing the space again, so that I could welcome the happy day, and the congratulations from near and far.</seg>
<seg id="8"> My lips moved upwards, and my incisor then molars started appearing on the scene of the session. Innocent laughs roared, and between their folds they announced to the waves the success of their deal with me, although I was the only winner.</seg>

<seg id="10"> even though you have nothing to gain ? I wish that I knew, why there weren't among humans, a sea of tenderness, to takes me in arms, enfold me as you did now. I stood, a look of farewell and then I ended the meeting with the sea and left.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Also, as I read, in actual fact, and in my present state, I have become fearful of entering into dialogue with anyone, because I fear the barricades of ideas, behind which the conversers hide.

<seg id="1"> An Attempt to Penetrate the Mentality of Western Youth, in Search of Causes of Academic Excellence 2</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An attempt to penetrate the mentality of western youth, in search of cause of academic excellence 2. The culture of beauty and creativity:</seg>
<seg id="3"> Perhaps some of you will not agree with me on this point, but I view it as fundamental to finding a sort of striving for excellence combined with perfection in the western mentality. This culture is evident in their attention to appearances, and applying aesthetic touches to everything. They do not rely solely on inventing something without an aesthetic touch.</seg>
<seg id="4"> And when you grow up in a beautiful country, a beautiful house, and see beauty and cleanliness everywhere, this will reflect on the quality of your production, and I do not exaggerate when I say, even on the volume of this production. In addition to producing a sort of love for creativity, this culture breeds a society that has no mercy for failure.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is hard to find disguised unemployment, or nepotism in the west, and this is a compulsive motivation for every person to improve their production, and acquire new skills, enabling them to work for a living, and enjoy life. A life, which as I mentioned above can only be enjoyed with money, which in turn only comes about with serious and hard work and acquisition of skills.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore we see the ceaseless effort of employees to get promoted in their work. This does not come arbitrarily; but actually comes about after you give something to your work. Whereas if you knew that your creativity and the increase of your production will not give you any benefit, you would become frustrated and abandon the idea from its outset, and leave the promotion to people in favored positions, who once ascend to a position they are unsuited for, they immediately become an instrument of destruction in the workplace, and Allah knows better. Fewer social problems:</seg>
<seg id="7"> Of course the social problems surrounding any man, hampers his imagination and creativity, and even his fundamental abilities to work correctly. However, one might say that western society is heaving with the problems of divorce, disintegration and emotional breakdowns; and I say this is true, but the problem is not magnified, and it does not follow one all his life, similar to what happens in our society where looks follow you and every social gathering talks about you when you have a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The nature of our family ties increase the pressures on you, while the apathy of their societies, removes the burden of these problem from you, and this in turn keeps you in a good production mode, or only leaves a partial effect that soon disappears, and Allah is the all-knowing. To be continued, Allah willing.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Do Not Starve Our Children to Death.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Sami Al-Akhras: The lion extended his powers and influence, paraded his strength, stuck his claws into the heart of the homeland, and devoured everyone to make himself the king of a barren jungle, with no water nor grass; a jungle whose only savior from desert is piles of refugee camps. Destiny has chosen to take them and their tents to the deserts of Gaza, where they piled up in the human warehouses established by the United Nations Relief & Works Agency .</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the middle of the jungle, the victorious lion crouches, puzzled, wondering what to do with these mouths, and these wounded predators, who are looking for something to nourish them and silence the cries of their hungry children.</seg>
<seg id="4"> And the wounded lion lurks, and roars whenever he has a chance to announce his presence, and that he is still there, present and steadfast, standing on his feet.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Between the victorious lion of Gaza, and the wounded lion of the West Bank, as the mill turns and grinds everyone, decisions and decrees follow in succession from both of them. Each of them is seeking legitimacy that the occupation extorts with jets and tanks every day; a legitimacy that has been baptized on the corpses and blood of a whole nation, and a cause that is standing against the hurricanes of death and uprooting.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Within the thicket of battle for legitimacy, the Prime Minister appointed to lead the emergency government, Salam Fayadh issued - and he is considered an economists who deal with the conditions according to certain economic vision, addressing through it the emotions of the hungry, because they are victims of hunger and poverty, their only resource to provide for their children are salaries which eroded during the past phase, the phase of democracy, and the two-headed legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> We go back to the origin of the narrative, and the beginning of the story, we all know, acknowledge and assert that the employment procedures are according to the certificate of competence you obtain from the party, and the color of your party flag, since the academic certificate is insignificant and does not indicate competence. This is because of our universities, which now do not award an academic degree without mentioning the party affiliation on it. It is an unforgivable mistake if they did not observe this entry in the certificate, and disregarded that it is more important than the Grade Point Average of the graduating student.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Prime Minister Salam Fayadh, issued a decision to terminate employment contracts which were signed in the last two years. The decision did not clarify any reasons, whether it was passed as a slap to the outgoing government or within a complete reform process to the employment situation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> If it was a slap to the outgoing government, then the slap has landed, and landed strongly on the faces of the employee's children, because the outgoing prime minister, ministers, members of cabinet, members of Al-Qassam, members of the executive, and all the government and party clique, have guaranteed and secured salaries with incentives, bonuses, sundries,  transport allowance, risk allowance, duty allowance, driving allowance, health social and psychological allowance, clothing, protein-and-energy-rich-meal allowance, and I guarantee that they will not be affected, and will enjoy warm peaceful and happy sleep at night.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Meanwhile, if it was an employment reform, then question and exclamation marks, and alongside them all other punctuation marks will not suffice for the question, what reform ?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Is the reform in punishing the children of employees for the affiliation of their parents, or punishing the children because they are sons and daughters of contract employees?</seg>
<seg id="12"> Excuse us, Prime Minister Fayadh! Leave your battle away from the cries of the hungry child and the defeated father, and reconsider this dangerous decision. Do not kill our children in the name of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Have mercy on our people, have mercy on your relatives, and spare the children of the future from death, starvation and hatred. Those you want to punish, have kitchens that smell of grills and roasts, the smells of delicious foods waft to the music of sea waves, while those who starve are children of those employees. Have mercy on the people of this earth, to merit the mercy of the one in heaven.</seg>

<seg id="2"> After the generous 25 million dollar donation made by Saudi Aramco through its office in the United Sates of America in the state of Texas for the construction of houses for some residents of the state of Louisiana who were victims of Hurricane Katrina, while some Saudi people are sinking below the poverty line and others are in debt.</seg>

Health programs in Saihat, associations in al-Qadih, sports activities for Shiites, and everything allocated for the community has begun to be transported from Aramco, bypassing al-Khobar and al-Dammam to reach to al-Qatif, and for the Shiites only.

<seg id="1"> French Minister: Bush Behind September 11th Attacks?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The web site www.Reopen911.info on the internet reports that a senior French political personality currently occupying the position of a minister in the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy intimated last year that American President George Bush might have been behind the attacks of September 11, 2001.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The web site, which promotes conspiracy theories about the attacks of September 11th, published a video tape of the French Minister of Housing and the Cities, Christine Boutin, in which she seems to doubt that the al-Qaeda organization, which is led by Osama Bin Laden, planned the attacks. Boutin's office tried to downplay those comments.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In an interview with her last November, before she became a minister, she was asked whether she believed that Bush might have been behind the attacks. Boutin said, "I believe that is probably the case. I believe that is probably the case."</seg>
<seg id="5"> Boutin supports this view by pointing to the large number of people who visit sites on the internet that doubt the official line regarding the September 11th attacks on American cities.</seg>
<seg id="6"> She said, "I know that the internet sites that talk about this problem are sites visited by the largest number of visitors, ... and I tell myself that this public expression ... cannot be without any truth."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Boutin's office sought to downplay these comments, saying that in a subsequent segment of the same interview she said, "I am not telling you that I subscribe to this position." - This comment does not appear on the video that was published on the site.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A number of internet sites have also published the video tape in recent days, and the story has started to leak into the mainstream media.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In a headline the newspaper Le Monde said,  - "Christine Boutin fell into the trap of her controversial intimations about September 11th."</seg>
<seg id="10"> So will the minister's point of view change after she assumes her position in Sarkozy's government? An official's statement is held against him, and is not considered an ordinary statement that can be brushed aside.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Low Number of Gulf Tourists in Syria Affects Income of Apartment Owners, Taxi Drivers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The low number of Gulf tourists in Syria affects the income of apartment owners, taxi drivers, and sellers of merchandise. .... Damascus (Sabaq) - A'id al-Ghamidi: The problems faced by many travelers to Syria as a result of being subjected to robbery, fraud, and deceit by gangs who have made it their goal to prey on those people of various nationalities, and follow them and take from them -- in some cases it has gone as far as murder --, and steal money. Most of these incidents have been aimed at citizens of the Gulf states, which has caused them to be exposed to harm.</seg>
<seg id="3"> These recurring events in recent periods have caused many people, especially from the Gulf, to abstain from traveling to spend the summer vacation in Syria this year as they used to do in past years, and to change their destination this year to other countries in an effort to look out for their own safety and the safety of their possessions, and out of a desire to enjoy their summer vacation.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Some Saudi newspapers have published a number of cases in which people were unjustifiably imprisoned, as well as some incidents of murder in apartments and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="5"> On a tour for Sabaq in the Syrian capital, Damascus, we met a number of workers in professions that have a direct relationship with the tourists and those who come to Syria. The vitality of their business is affected during the summer and their income is directly affected by tourists, since summertime is considered a boom season for them. They include taxi drivers, owners of apartment rental offices, owners of barber shops, owners of commercial shops, and sellers of merchandise. They all agreed that this summer was extremely bad, especially with regard to citizens of the Arab Gulf states. While we were riding with him one taxi driver said, "You are the first Gulf citizen to ride with me since a month ago. He noted that in previous years he used to work all day and during the whole summer and most of his customers were from the Gulf. He stressed that his income was +affected this year by the lack of interest in the country this year from Gulf tourists."</seg>
<seg id="6"> An owner of a shop that sells merchandise confirmed what was said. He said, "The decline in the level of our sales this year is because of the low number of Gulf tourist shoppers, of whom there used to be many and who, when they came to Syria, were eager to buy various goods to take back with them to their countries when they went home."</seg>
<seg id="7"> A number of owners of real estate offices said, "When the summertime was a booming season for renting apartments it was difficult to get a furnished apartment more than a week after the beginning of the season. This year, most of the furnished apartments are still vacant and are offered at the filthiest prices to the tenants whose numbers are still very few."</seg>
<seg id="8"> An owner of a real estate office adds, "In past years the owner of the office was the one who chose the apartments for the customers, and the prices were very profitable. But this year the customer is the one who chooses the suitable apartment and names the price that suits him, but the offices are still competing to attract him because of the scarcity of people coming to Syria as tourists this year, especially from the Gulf states.</seg>

<seg id="2"> England Honors Marcel Khalifa and Beatles?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Last July/July 14 the Lebanese artist Marcel Khalifa attended a party in Liverpool thrown by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the middle of the city of the Beatles and the city of John Lennon. Its airport carries the name of this artist.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The party was held in the Philharmonic Hall at the end of the five days of the Annual Arab Cultural Festival in Liverpool which each year hosts a prominent Arab personality in the field of the arts. The celebration this year was for Khalifa.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He gave another party at Saint George Hall in Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Khalifa played the oud during the two parties and he also performed vocal pieces. He was joined in his performance by his two sons Ramy on the piano and Bashar on percussion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Arab evening at the Philharmonic had two parts. The first was a piano concerto composed by Abdallah al-Masri of Lebanon. It was followed by an Andalusian suite for oud and orchestra by Marcel Khalifa. It included the following pieces "al-Zagharid," "Granada," "Your Strutting Figure," and "Oh, Girls of Alexandria."</seg>
<seg id="8"> The orchestra was conducted by maestro Clark Rundell, and more than 3,000 people came to the two parties to listen to this new music in Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Khalifa said that the mayor of Liverpool, Clark Takis, welcomed him on the occasion. In a speech in which he welcomed the Lebanese artist, he expressed his opinion that he is one of the contemporary musical composers whose music expresses humanity with its transparency and its comprehensiveness. His participation with the Philharmonic Orchestra in Liverpool left a deep and great impact on us.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Lebanese artist will complete his summer artistic tour in Europe and the Arab World. On July 30 he is scheduled to join the Omani Symphony Orchestra in Muscat with the famous Indian violinist +Subramaniam</seg>
<seg id="11"> Khalifa will also participate in the European Youth Festival held in Berlin on August 10 conducted by maestro Simon Wright. On the 25th of the same month he will join the Absolute Ensemble conducted by the American Kristjan Järvi at a party to be held at the Kennedy Center in New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Concerning these tours and joint appearances Khalifa said, "I travel east and west in my work with these world orchestras, motivated by love so that this work can be an echo and a story in which I express my doubt and certainty. Frankly, I reflect myself through it in support of my country without being an emissary of any party."</seg>
<seg id="13"> Khalifa added, "I represent my country in my own way. Perhaps through my music I represent the secular democratic Lebanon, a new Lebanon, remote from sectarianism, favoritism, and hostage taking.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Khalifa presented his works for a short period within the framework of the Spring of Music in the town of Nancy in northern France with the Gardius Symphony Orchestra conducted by François Ligi, and prior to that that with the Italian Philharmonic Orchestra in Milan conducted by Karl Martin.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Will Carthage Festival Be Biased Towards Its Countrymen +This Year?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Will Carthage Festival Be Biased Towards Its Countrymen +This Year?</seg>
<seg id="3"> The amphitheater of the Carthage theater was built in the early part of the second century. It witnessed many transformations in the third and fourth centuries before it was demolished in the year 439 by the Vandals. The circle of its amphitheatre, the diameter of which is about 106 meters, leans against the slope of the Odeon Hill, while its length is more than 50 meters, and the windows in its background were decorated with towering statues, while the whole structure was built of white marble and Kedel limestone.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It had room for more than 11,000 spectators. A large part of it was demolished, and it was gradually covered with debris.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It was discovered in 1904 by the researcher Gauckler.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In 1967 it was restored and became the stage for the Carthage International Festival, one of the most important and distinctive summer activities in the Tunisian cultural scene, which marks its 43rd season starting tomorrow, Saturday, and will last until August 16, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This year's season will witness increased participation by Tunisian artistic acts, especially after the issuance of decisions requiring about 60 percent of the acts to be Tunisian at the various festivals.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The most prominent Tunisian participation will be the performances of Sabir al-Ruba'i, Sofia Sadek, and Latifa al-Arafawy. They seem to be shows postponed from the previous season.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The other shows include an evening with the Moroccan artist Gad al-Maleh on July 31st.</seg>
<seg id="10"> As for Arab acts, the festival books some of them by agreement with the Rotana Company as has been the case for more than three years, although that has been met with strong opposition, especially from the local press, in the face of the confusion that has become routine and expected because of the announcement of a group of names and then the list changes at the last minute or even a little after that.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The festival, which this year is run by Mr. Muhammad Raja Farhat, will produce the opening and closing parties, a festival custom for years.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The opening party will be devoted to presenting examples of popular musical and literary heritage according to a contemporary reading.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The closing party will be devoted to honoring a select group of senior creative artists in the field of Tunisian music, many of whom we have reviewed in the recent period. It is enough to mention the great musician Ali al-Sariti and the late musician Abd al-Hamid Bal'aljiya, and others. ...</seg>
<seg id="14"> It is worth mentioning that this year Tunisia celebrates the 50th anniversary of the declaration of the republic, and the evening of July 25th at the Carthage Festival will be consistent with this event. During the show many national songs will be presented with the participation of a select group of famous Tunisian voices, including Lotfy Boshnaq, Saneya Mubarak, Shokry Bozian, Sofia Sadeq, Laila Hageeg, Dorsaf al-Hamadany, and Rehab al-Sagheer. ...</seg>
<seg id="15"> The work team of that evening will be managed by the composer Hamadi Ben Uthman.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The band will be conducted by Mr. Ahmad Ashour, the conductor of the Tunisian Symphony Orchestra. It will be augmented with a group of oriental instruments and a group of the most skilled musicians in Tunisia.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Weddings in Falma Between Drifting Behind Fashion, Jumping Over Traditions</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Weddings in Falma are between drifting behind fashion and jumping over traditions. Weddings in Falma are in between drifting behind the fashion and jumping over the traditions.</seg>
<seg id="3"> I said in yesterday's episode that the father of the bridegroom or one of his relatives spends a whole week on the back of his horse inviting people to attend the wedding of his son. But today, with the development that is taking place and blind fashion, this custom, which used to enhance social ties, has changed. It has been replaced by decorated paper invitations that are sent by mail or by fax or are delivered by hand. Invitations are also made over the phone with no movement even if the guest is meters away in the same neighborhood or village.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As for the rituals of presenting food to the men and women guests, they too have changed according to fashion. Men are now the ones who bring the food to the women when previously the place of the women's party used to be out of sight of the men. This happens in the absence of the noblewomen and those with golden fingertips whose time has come to be limited to putting on makeup, combing hair, putting on nail polish, changing flowing and transparent clothes every hour, dancing continuously to the tunes of the disk jockey device. Then the tables with food and desserts are brought to them by the men. That would not have been accepted by the men of yesterday who were accustomed to having the women prepare the food, while they were content to eat and spend the evening chatting.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Even the evening parties used to be held in the open air in front of the groom's house so that young and old could rejoice and have fun to the tunes of the zurna, the cane flute, and the drums. Today this has moved to wedding halls and rooms that are rented for about 5 million. They are enclosed and the only thing you hear from them is the sound of the disk jockey who shakes the hall with bands that have no relation to singing, with shameless and mocking lyrics. Dissipation and extravagance have reached their peak, and even the plates used at the wedding are now made out of plastic and other disposable materials. Formerly the plates at the wedding used to fill the houses of large families and were used by neighbors and relatives. These expenses placed a heavy burden of debt on the groom and his family that he had to continue to repay for many years.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The change has even touched the wedding night rituals. Instead of the couple spending their night in the family's house after the evening party is over and the guests have departed - as it is said here - and only the families of the bride and the groom are left, everyone has come to prefer renting hotel rooms for very high prices that are added to the other burdens.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Even the food is no longer limited to couscous, soup, or shakshouka, but it has been replaced by tagine of sweets and olives and other foods.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Concerning this change that has touched the traditions of the Falmi wedding, my uncle Muhammad, an old man of 80 years of age, sighed as if time had returned him to the days of his youth, and said, "What a pity about the days and weddings of the past. They were held for seven days. In our times it was intention, blessing, and modesty.</seg>
<seg id="9"> My uncle Muhammad spoke at length about the day of his wedding. He said, "At that time I was 17 years old when my father arranged a marriage for me. Do you know that the wedding was held while I was harvesting the wheat and I did not rest except on the day of the bride's arrival? I did not see her before the wedding night. Despite that, we have stayed together to this day, because the intention was to form a strong family in which love and wellbeing prevailed, not like your generation who get married in the summer and get divorced in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="10"> As for al-Hajja Fatima, who is 76 years of age, when we asked her about weddings of the past, she said, "Our opinion was of no importance with regard to our marriage. This applied not only to the bride but also to the groom. His opinion was not taken into account about whether to become engaged to such-and-such a girl because in those days it was the fathers who chose the groom and even the trousseau which the bride took along to the marital home, and the setting of the wedding day.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Everything was simple in our times, as the dowry did not exceed 500 centimes and the trousseau consisted of a sewing machine and a small suitcase that contained a pair of +embroidered dresses. The wedding was held for seven days and nights with everyone welcome, and with drums, zurna, and gunpowder. As for the food, the main dish at weddings of the past was couscous and al-rafis." She says that at her wedding her husband slaughtered 24 male sheep to feed the guests. She said, "Those days are unforgettable. Thank God we lived in understanding and happiness and we did not have problems like your generation. In spite of the blessings it enjoys it is not settled. What we call the great celibacy among young men and young women is nothing but a sign of fear of the unknown before embarking on marriage."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Arab Elections</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In Arab elections in civilized countries the candidates in the general elections are subject to standards aimed at bringing in people with competence and cultural and scientific qualifications and people with a good resume, in order to make the role of the legislative councils more effective in serving the country and the citizens, which serves the stability of the state.</seg>
<seg id="3"> General elections in the Arab countries, on the other hand, are like a democratic play performed on the regimes' stage with the goal of getting the rear ends of members of parties loyal to them into the seats of the council by creating protected lists that will support them for victory, regardless of their scientific, cultural, or humanitarian qualifications, even if they are harboring more good intentions for their pockets than for their country.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The means of gathering votes from voters varies from one candidate to another. We see one of them pitches tents and brings in food and hookahs and sometimes musical groups. Another roams the electoral areas so that he passes by a house where condolences are being paid and weeps forcefully for the deceased in order to obtain the votes of the deceased's family, and maybe the vote of the deceased person himself. Then he moves directly to a wedding hall to offer congratulations on the wedding of another voter.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Another may resort to inventing methods of advertising for his electoral campaign, such as distributing pieces of candy on which his name and his picture are inscribed, which may expose him to the risk of high blood sugar levels if he loses the elections.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Some others insist on plunging into the electoral battle in spite of their certainty of not winning, in order to affect one of the candidates for the benefit of another candidate behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Most candidates who are native speakers of Arabic are not proficient at thinking or expressing themselves. Nevertheless, they step up to the platforms and the rostrums to make statements about providing job opportunities, higher salaries, and free education, which makes us pray for mercy for the statements of al-Sahhaf about American hooligans, although al-Sahhaf did not commit the crime of burying alive the Arabic language.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Once the elections, are over the candidates themselves unsheathe the sword of taxes to cut off the heads of the poor. Then they sleep, suffering from indigestion from spices and milk, delicious food, while around them the hearts of the low income people yearn for codfish and cured meat.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The presidential elections in our democratic country -- which are called the fast food elections -- are the elections that transformed the citizens into mummies that go meekly to the ballot boxes to produce an electoral victory with a percentage of 99%, a percentage that saints and holy men do not get.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Occupation Authorities Prevent Child Asil from Realizing Dream to Represent Children of Palestine in Dabke Folk Festival in Qatar. Salfit - Ma'a - Asil sighed intensely as tears flowed down her tender cheeks covered in a natural blush that added beauty to the innocence of a childhood which the occupation has deprived of even some of its simplest human rights.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Asil is a dreamy child, full of vitality and activity. She is a girl 14 years of age. She loved life and adored its beauty in spite of the blackness of the days in which her people are living. Asil is a member in a local dabke troupe in the city of Ramallah. She has excelled and perfected her role worthily. Hope was spurring her on to participate in the festival in which she would show her artistic talents and abilities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Finally Asil got the opportunity to travel to Qatar with her troupe to perform shows there, with another show in Amman. Asil's life was overflowing with happiness. She ran into the house and kissed her parents and her siblings. "My wish has come true and I will travel to perform the dabke and dance there, and I will show the heritage of my country to the audiences of the Arab Gulf," she said to her father.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But Asil is a child of parents who carry an identity card issued in the city of Gaza. They live in the West Bank. Her family's house is in a village near Qalqiliyah, the land of her father and grandfather. There are dozens of dunams with hundreds of olive trees, whose roots extend down to the depths of the earth, and whose branches embrace the clouds in the sky, to testify that Asil and her ancestors were here and will remain here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In a homeland torn by the occupation, the people of Gaza were required to obtain an exit permit and coordination from the occupation army to return to their place of residence in the West Bank. Otherwise they will be sent away to Gaza and will not be able to return to the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Asil's father applied to the Civil Liaison Office of the occupation army, with a request for coordination for his daughter to leave with her troupe, but the occupation authorities rejected Asil's application and did not allow her to travel with her troupe to participate in the Qatar festival.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Asil went back to her home in Ramallah cursing the occupation. Life became darker before her innocent, child's face. "What crime did I commit?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Why did not I travel with my troupe?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Why do they deprive us of our rights to live like other people?" Asil said in her pain.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Fatah Corruption Scandals Call for Movement's Comprehensive Cleansing, Rebuilding Again</seg>
<seg id="3"> Al-Zahar reveals documents showing embezzlement of billions of the people's money by the leaders of Fatah</seg>
<seg id="4"> The leader of the Islamic resistance movement (Hamas), Mahmoud al-Zahar, reviewed a group of documents and figures seized in the security headquarters that prove the financial and administrative corruption in which the leaders of the Fatah movement and the Palestinian Authority were involved.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At a political meeting held last night in the big mosque in the al-Bureij Camp in the middle of Gaza Strip, al-Zahar said, "Salam Fayyad is involved in cases of corruption, and Hamas has documents that prove it. It will show them at the appropriate time."</seg>
<seg id="6"> He asserted that there are documents proving that the Central Committee of the Fatah movement had questioned Salim al-Za'nun, the chairman of the National Council, about the embezzlement of 2 million dollars belonging to the Palestinian people.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He revealed a group of illegal acts of embezzlement and exploitation of public funds in figures proving the involvement of a number of Fatah leaders, including Nabil Abu Rudeina, the advisor to the president of the Authority, Salam Fayyad, and Muhammad Rashid, the advisor to the late head of the Authority, Arafat, and others.</seg>
<seg id="8"> At the meeting, which was attended by a large gathering of families and citizens, al-Zahar said, "There are documents about the supervisory committee in the legislative in May (May) 1997 proving that the financial corruption exceeded 326 million, and that Abu Rudeina received 33,000 dollars from Arafat as expenses for his daughters in Britain."</seg>
<seg id="9"> He explained that, according to the documents, the Zionist occupation conducted an investigation of one of the oil czars in the Zionist entity, a person named +Ovadia Koko, who used to pay half a million shekels annually to Muhammad Dahlan, the same amount for protection in the Bank, and 400,000 shekels to Rashid.

<seg id="2"> Warnings of Crocker to Justify Continued Occupation, Control of Oil Cake. Crocker: The violence that will happen in Iraq will surpass the imagination. The American ambassador in Baghdad expects total collapse of the Iraqi security forces under the weight of sectarian pressures.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Occupied Baghdad - The American ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, told the newspaper the New York Times that the early departure of the American forces from Iraq or their withdrawal to bases within Iraq may lead to a sharp increase in violence and lead to the killing of thousands.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The newspaper said that Crocker's statements were made in an interview it had with him on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The statements coincide with the increasing fears of Iraqi leaders that the increasing pressures on American President George Bush will lead to the premature withdrawal of American forces.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Iraqi leaders from various sects warned on Monday that the early withdrawal of American forces would drown the country in all-out civil war.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The leaders were commenting on a separate report in the newspaper about the escalation of the argument within the White House about a gradual reduction in the number of the forces.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The White House denied the content of the article.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the possibility the violence would dangerously increase in the event of the withdrawal of the American forces, Crocker said the consequence must be considered and those who say that we can establish bases in other areas of the country must also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="10"> He continued, "Yes, we can. .. But there will be a possibility that the American forces would stand by while civilians are slaughtered by the thousands. This is not a good possibility."</seg>
<seg id="11"> Crocker and the American military commander General David Petraeus will submit a report to the Congress in mid-September on whether the big increase in the number of American forces has succeeded in curbing the violence and whether the political leaders in Iraq have achieved progress in national reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> This week the American Congress will hold what is expected to be an exciting discussion regarding the future and the funding of the war before an important report on Iraq is submitted by the administration to the Congress by July 15.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Crocker said that in his warning he is relying on what he has observed since he assumed his position about four months ago, on his prior experience in Iraq more than 25 years ago, and on lessons learned from his work in Beirut in the early 80s.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The New York Times quoted Crocker as saying that a failure of imagination made it impossible to anticipate the violence that filled Lebanon when it slid into civil war.</seg>
<seg id="15"> He added, "I am sure that what will happen here is beyond any imagination."</seg>
<seg id="16"> The newspaper said that in his presentation of the risks that would result from the withdrawal of the American forces Crocker mentioned a number of possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He said that this includes the possibility of the entire collapse of the Iraqi 350,000-strong security forces under the weight of the sectarian pressures and their breakup into militias.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Voice of Truth in Clutches of Ignorant; Ougi: Release Abducted Journalist Alan Johnston for Sake of Palestine, Cause, Homeland; English-Arab Organization Joins European Assembly of Activists Calling for Release of British Journalist</seg>
<seg id="3"> London - A statement by the English-Arab Organization reported that Nazmi Ougi, the chairman of the organization, called upon the kidnappers of British journalist Alan Johnston to release him for the sake of Palestine, the cause, and the homeland.</seg>
<seg id="4"> A statement by the organization noted that reverberations of the BBC reporter's abduction are still creating many stormy protests all over the world, particularly in the arenas of words and opinions. This was not the only case. It has occurred repeatedly in Lebanon, in Iraq, and elsewhere, so that restraining speech is about to become an Arab attribute. As a result it will become an accusation against us and engender contempt for our civilization, while freedom of speech has always been the most faithful friend to the people of Palestine at the regional and international level.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The statement comes amid an expanded European campaign launched by an assembly of press organizations and Islamic European organizations calling for the release of Johnston.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Ougi is joined in the campaign by Robert Menard, the chairman of the Reporters Without Borders organization, Dalil Bubakr, the chairman of the French Council of the Islamic Religion, Malek Abou Zeid, the chairman of the Frenchmen of Arab Origins organization, Abdul Rahman Dahman, the chairman of the Council of Democratic Islamists in France, and Muhammad Bushari, the chairman of the Union of Islamic Organizations in France.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The statement of the English-Arab Organization said that speech and its defenders were one of the powerful strongholds on which the Palestinians and the Arabs are building their hopes for revealing that which is hidden and clarifying the facts.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Now, when a man of words is abducted, what a high price this will cost us in propaganda and in the media!</seg>
<seg id="9"> What tax will patriotic and national strife be made to pay?</seg>
<seg id="10"> In return for this abduction, whatever its motives and whoever may have been responsible for it, the accusation will certainly be spread that in our confrontation we are people who do not distinguish between those who hold pens and those who carry weapons, those who are looking for the truth, and those who compete with one another in the rape of the homeland.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It added, "We implore you to release the British journalist. We implore you to preserve the sanctity and respect of speech.</seg>
<seg id="12"> We implore you not to add new adversaries to our adversaries. Rather, we and you must present to them evidence of the justness of our causes. We know who the advocates of war are, and who the advocates for a just peace are. It is not fair to shuffle the cards when it is always clear to us who our real enemies are, and who our friends are.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In Britain, there are voices emerging in demonstrations for your sake, chanting in support of your rights. Do not make things uncertain for them. Do not give your real enemies the opportunity for satisfaction and the fabrication of lies about your positions. Release Alan Johnston, the British journalist, for the sake of Palestine, the cause, and the nation."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Rise in Sardine Prices Due to Natural, Professional Factors; Moroccan Consumer First Victim. The Moroccan coasts are experiencing an exceptional, unprecedented situation represented in the big decline of the fish stock to the point of scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The authorities attribute this dangerous situation to new natural factors affecting Moroccan waters that have led to the migration of the fish. But expert sources in the field of fishing, on the other hand, explain this phenomenon by the excess exploitation of the fish stock in absence of a plan for shallow fish, which has caused this stock to face a large depletion.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Many international organizations -- at the head of which is the Food and Agriculture Organization -- previously warned about these unacceptable practices represented in fishing of large quantities of tender sardines that are suitable for human consumption and sending them to the fish meal factories for processing instead of being content only with the rotten quantities that are not suitable for direct consumption.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The trucks used to wait in a long line in front of the Al-Oyoun plant coming from the port of al-Dakhila, before Minister al-Unsur interferes and puts an end to this crime, by signing the national plan for shallow fish which is designed to rationalize the fishing of these kinds of fish on the one hand, and on the other hand specify the quantities allowed to be fished in each sector, with an estimated total of 1 million tons annually, considering that the total stock is estimated at 8 million tons, of which 3 million tons are available for exploitation. This is in spite of the resistance shown by the lobbies that control the sector and that benefit from the prevailing situation, and that were behind the failure of the former ministers to devise it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It should be noted that this plan is the second one after the octopus plan, which was devised after that type of fish became threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The ministry, which allocated 80,000 tons for the production of high protein fish meal in the national plan for shallow fish, found it necessary to work to impose training on the fish meal industry by closing the plants that did not make an effort at training, updating their methods of operation, and guaranteeing conditions of environmental safety.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The nation's mission was the first to warn against the depletion practiced by many ships, and to stand up to the trucks that transport the sardines to the fish meal plants. This was within the sight and hearing of the authorities who kept silent and continued to play the role of the bystander.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On a related topic, Kamal Sabri, the deputy chairman of the Middle North Atlantic Chamber of Fishing, explained that the fish merchants have become aware of the importance of the local consumption market, which has seen important developments over the last two years with respect to revenue, especially since those merchants have come to make better offers than the plants.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In a special statement Sabri showed that the price of sardines, for example, increased to 2.50 dirhams from 1.60 dirhams a kilo in the ports of the southern regions.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He added that the price of sardines in the city of Casablanca has seen an increase as a result of the lack of stock on one hand and the big consumer demand for this item on the other hand, since it now ranges between 10 and 20 dirhams per kilo, according to the quality.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Rescue this Child .. She is in Agony. When poverty and illness come together in a family that does not have daily food it becomes a social tragedy of profound severity. This is the case of the family of Ben Abdullah in the city of Tlemcen in western Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The entire story of this family can be summarized in the daily sufferings of the child Firyal, who is 18 months old. We met her mother, who was holding her, in the company of the chairwoman of the Patients' Defense Association. Her tears preceded her words. The mother did not believe what had befallen her innocent daughter.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She was born afflicted by hemiplegia as a result of an abnormal delivery. Despite that, she used to be able to see. A few months later it was discovered that she had begun to lose her sight in her right eye.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After a six-month trip to hospitals and specialists the doctors assured her mother that it would be possible to treat her. But in the meantime her eye started to get red. She took her to the Oran hospital. There she received medical monitoring for a full week. Then her eye started to turn yellow. Then it became a whiteness that destroyed her eyes. This was discovered after a medical examination she had at a clinic in Oran where she was asked to go abroad for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Hemiplegia, loss of eyesight, and daily suffering with an incurable case. After another trip of searching the mother of Firyal Ben Abdullah was told that the surgery would cost her 32 million centimes for one eye, which meant a total amount of about 64 million centimes. The only one who performs this kind of surgery is Mrs. Hartani, in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Here Mrs. Ben Abdullah stops. The screaming of her daughter increases from time to time because of the pain which does not leave the child, especially when the rays of the sun are reflected on her face.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Here Mrs. Ben Abdullah implores all benevolent people or the local authorities to look at her daily suffering with the illness of her child, who is not more than two years old.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Daily suffering increased by the difficult social situation of the family since her father is +unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> "I hope for nothing but the restoration of my child's sight and the end of this tragedy," says her mother after tears poured down her entire face while she begged for compassion from all who are interested in eliminating the wrong done to the family and to her child, who is silently dying.</seg>

<seg id="4"> The human body maintains its temperature at about 37 degrees centigrade in spite of all the changes in temperature around it.

<seg id="5"> How does the human body maintain its temperature?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The body does this by maintaining an equilibrium between producing and losing heat. The body produces heat through chemical reactions that take place inside it. This, in short, is known as metabolism. Through metabolism food is converted into energy. There is another source of heat in the body, namely the work of the muscles during strenuous effort.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Conversely, the body cools itself by getting rid of extra heat. This release is mainly by radiating heat and sweating through the skin.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The East is the cradle of religions and civilizations. In spite of that it has been caught in the trap of cultural backwardness. When it wanted to rise again to change those abject conditions, it found itself at a crossroads and did not know which one to take. Each road has advocates presenting it in a favorable light.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This has been the cause of the conflict in the East between the pioneers of renaissance and renewal, some of whom turn their face towards the West taking from it all that it has without testing or selection of its good from its bad, while throwing away their entire doctrinal and cultural heritage.</seg>
<seg id="5"> And there are those who have turned their face towards Islam, deriving from it the bases, frameworks, principles, and methods without turning their back on what the West has in the way of the components of economic and political renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="6"> On the sideline of these two major trends live two teams: A team which sees Islam as the safe refuge, the invulnerable stronghold, and the helpful guide for renaissance, while strictly admonishing against taking from the West any motive for renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Then there is a hesitant confused group for whom the path is not clear. It does not know in which direction to turn its face, to Islam or to the West.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The problem between the first two large parties was represented in religion. The first team believes that the West developed when it threw away religion, the authority of the church, and the dominion of the popes and the clergymen. So if we want to take the road of renaissance, the only way to do that is to throw away religion and its values and acquire the new western values instead.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The second team, on the other hand, was moderate and fair, reflecting the moderation of Islam. It does not blame Islam for this backwardness among Muslims, but it seeks to make Islam once again the basis for the revival as it was in the first Islamic era, taking into consideration the best of what the West has achieved as long as it does not infringe upon belief or culture.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The construction of a healthy civilization must have two wings: a moral spiritual wing, and a materialistic wing. The civilization that neglects spirit, values, and morality, and proceeds down the materialistic path to its utmost limit, is a miscarriage of a civilization, which no sooner flies than it falls down from the heights.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Since this morning, Monday, work crews in the municipality of Hebron renovated the market for stalls, located in the Bab al-Zawiya area in the city of Hebron.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The head of the municipality of Hebron, Khaled al- Issaily, issued a statement, a copy of which reached Ma'a. In it he said, "The municipality has painted the parts designated for vegetable peddlers. It has organized the divisions, and has distributed them in a way that is in keeping with the nature of the work in them.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The head of the municipality stressed that the only way to solve the problem of the stalls, that are found randomly in the city's streets, is to move the peddlers and the owners of the stalls to the market allocated for them, which is located in an area in the middle of the city. This creates a state of equilibrium and eases traffic for peddlers and for shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Al-Issaily added that this market, which was designed geometrically and is organized, and which is close to parking lots, the city's neighborhoods, and the surrounding villages, also provides good economic traffic for the peddlers and makes buying easy for shoppers.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The head of the municipality of Hebron, Khaled al-Issaily, revealed that the municipal crews had detected 30 cases of water theft during the past month. He added that they are continuing the process of monitoring the loss of water to reduce it as much as possible, in spite of the fact that it is much better than several Arab capitals. The percentage of the loss for the past month amounted to about 32%, while it is 50%-54% in Arab capitals.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Al-Issaily, who spoke with our reporter in Hebron, said, "During the coming months we will try to reduce this rate of loss, after improving the water network, and by arresting and prosecuting those who steal drinking water which they use to irrigate their crops.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Al-Issaily emphasized that the city is not suffering from a crisis in drinking water, but it does suffer from some disturbance in the supply from the Palestinian Water Authority, because of a disturbance in their wells that supply the southern West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Al-Issaily added, "I personally track the amounts of water that reach us by reviewing the records and contacting the Water Authority. The quantity of water that reaches us daily is between 14,000 and 19,000 cups.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Al-Issaily noted that the municipality of Hebron is seeking to build two tanks in the Jabal Jawhar and Jabal Abu Ruman areas of the city with the cooperation of the American development agency USAID. There are also two points in the water pipeline between Halhul and southern Hebron for feeding the al-Manshar tank and the al-Jalda tank.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Al-Issaily also noted that he had asked the Israelis to supply Hebron with 7,000 to 8,000 cups of drinking water daily through the Water Authority, and that they had promised him that they would do this.</seg>

<seg id="9"> According to the source, the prison contained more than 600 people, Sunni Arabs, including pilots, generals, colonels, and military officers who were in important positions during the time of the former regime, along with many ordinary citizens. The militias have been executing those prisoners and throwing them in the streets until the number has dropped to 415 as of now.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The source said that the prison is located underneath a two-story building, and it is run by the Badr organization. The report about this prison was made by a person who lives in the region. He conveyed this information to people working in humanitarian organizations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the informed source, the prison is cleverly hidden so that someone passing in the street will not even notice a guard at the gate, and the Americans may have passed close to it many times.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It added that all of them get only 15-20 bottles of water a day and simple food, most of it from garbage.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The sources point out that those prisoners were abducted without any information registered about them in the Ministry of the Interior or with the Americans.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Iraqi Journalist Reveals Names of Jordanian Journalists who Received Help from Iraqi Security Agencies</seg>
<seg id="3"> In statements he made on Kuwaiti satellite broadcasts, the well-known Iraqi writer and journalist Hassan al-Alawi threatened to publish lists of the names of Arab writers and journalists who used to receive monthly salaries from the Iraqi secret police.</seg>
<seg id="4"> He said that they must return the money that they stole from Iraq. ... He added that the Iraqi writers and journalists in exile were living on European assistance as political refugees while millions of Iraqi dinars were distributed to Arab writers and journalists who were agents of the ruler of Iraq. ... He said that there are dozens of press and satellite institutions that were financed by the Iraqi secret police.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The American satellite network Fox embarrassed the Jordanian Foreign Minister at the time, Marwan al-Ma'shar, when it asked him about the news that was published in the New York Times about the discovery of lists of the names of Jordanian writers and journalists who used to receive monthly salaries from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is well-known that Saddam Hussein built an elite residential suburb for Jordanian journalists in the ritziest neighborhood of Amman, and distributed villas among them for free. He also distributed Mercedes ghost cars to the editors-in-chief and chairmen of Jordanian newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The lists, which will be published soon, will include names like Mahmoud al-Kayed, Sultan al-Hattab, Muhammad al-Amd, Khayri Mansour, and Khalil al-Sawahiri, who owns a publishing house which was financed by the Iraqi secret police, in addition to the publisher of the newspaper al-Hilal, Ahmad Salama, and Hamada Fara'ina. ... It will also include the names of the owners of al-Dustour magazine, which was published in London, the editor-in-chief of al-Watan al-Arabi, and a large number of Lebanese and Egyptian journalists, foremost among them Fouad Mattar and Amin Iskandar. It also includes the names of Kuwaiti journalists, such as Ahmad al-Jarallah the owner of the newspaper al-Siyasa.</seg>
<seg id="8"> At the top of the list comes the Lebanese journalist Nabil al-Maghribi, who after the first gulf war issued the newspaper al-Muharrir in Paris. ...</seg>
<seg id="9"> It is said that Ahmad Salihin al-Hawni, the owner of the London newspaper al-Arab, and Abd al-Bari Atwan, the owner of the London newspaper al-Quds, are among the names that will appear in the lists.</seg>
<seg id="10"> According to Iraqi opposition sources the lists will include the names of the journalists and writers, the monthly amounts that were transferred to them, the method of their transfer, and their value. This does not include the financial compensation that Iraqi magazines used to grant to the Arab writers who wrote for them.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The Monastery of the Cross</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Monastery of the Cross. The Palace of Bergis on the Hama-Misyaf road, then a distance of 6 km from the highway and you have reached the Monastery of the Cross. The monastery was built on a rocky hill extending near the new village on an opposite hill to the southeast.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It was built from irregular stones, and ancient stones taken from the old buildings, of which only one building is left. That one is in the middle of the village, and it is known as the castle, or the crusader castle of Jupiter.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is a tower consisting of two floors, of which nothing remains but the first floor and the high wall of the second floor containing four defensive battlements.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The walls of the monastery were built from carved stones supported on the rock without groundwork. There is a press for raisin syrup and a mill, and between the church and the +nearby ancient site is another press for olives standing in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In view of the absence of wells, which were very rare, the inhabitants of the monastery were forced to collect rainwater in roofless tanks and cisterns.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The first thing the visitor sees is a barrier surrounding the monastery building and the cemetery together, at a height of 80 cm. the main facade of the church more than anything else was exposed to destruction. Nothing of it remains except two big sections in the south and the north.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The ground of the central courtyard was paved with a mosaic, but it was removed and nothing is left of it except the edges.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The cemeteries are a cube shaped building built of big stones. They include a room in which there are three large graves that were dug in the rock. Above each grave there is a small window, wide on the inside and narrow on the outside, in which the great bishops of the church were buried.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The floor mosaic of the diaconicon represents a square panel with a decorated frame depicting many different kinds of birds and small animals between the branches of fruitful grapevines with baskets placed beside them, in addition to nine equal squares, in which four girls representing the four seasons are portrayed. Each one is wearing something that represents a season. There is also a wild bull, a leaping lion, and a bird with a long beak. It is believed to go back to the fifth century A.D.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There is another church 3 km east of the monastery in a rocky area and an olive orchard with three entrances. On the lintel of the door we read in Greek, "Year 605 A.D." The church is surrounded by the landmarks of a dead city.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem Medal for Those Who Fight or Oppose Hamas</seg>
<seg id="3"> Jerusalem Medal for Those Who Fight or Oppose Hamas. By Muhammad Mufid al-Khalid</seg>
<seg id="4"> We have not heard much about you, Jerusalem Medal, although the last seven years have been full of the deeds of eminent holy warriors, for which they deserve the utmost respect. They also deserve to have their honor associated with the name of Jerusalem, which they have defended with their blood, their money, and their sons. But, as it has been said, we are in a strange and topsy-turvy time.</seg>
<seg id="5"> During a short period after the events of Gaza, the Jerusalem medals began to be showered on some people who were brought together on one day by only one thing: fighting, criticizing, or opposing the Hamas movement. Today you only have to criticize Hamas for what it did in Gaza in order to receive this honor, which is called the Jerusalem medal. And from whom?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Directly from the president, without delay or hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The one who gave these honors was heedless of two important things. The first is that this honor does not change the truth about anything, and that the honor will by no means deceive the sons of our Palestinian people, and will not turn a traitor into an honorable man or a killer into a holy warrior. Samih al-Madhoun, for example, will not be converted from a killer into a holy warrior, and the people will not forget who attacked them, burned their homes, and orphaned their children.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The second thing is that a person who is given the Jerusalem medal must be a protector of Jerusalem and al-Aqsa, not one who sells them or abandons them. All of us know, and you with your own tongue admitted and boasted, that you were one of the engineers of Oslo, which gave up our rights, our land, and our Jerusalem. Day after day you and your policies are still forfeiting our rights, and practicing the most arrogant kinds of impiety against the right of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The real honoring is the honoring of God, then the honoring of people and history on measures of truth and sacrifices. The real Jerusalem medal has been and still is awarded by the people to holy warriors and heroes when they go out carrying the martyr on their heads, declaring love, commitment, and loyalty to him.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Six thousand souls ... scorched by the rays of the sun, ... and 28 souls ascended to their creator ... complaining of the injustice of the humans ... and more is on the way. ...</seg>
<seg id="4"> Oh, God, What is the sin of sheikhs who kneel? ... and nursing children ... in the accounts of detestable and filthy politics? ...</seg>
<seg id="5"> Oh, God, what is the sin of those ... from gate to gate ... and the sons of paternal uncles and maternal uncles ... are kissing the hands stained with blood ... to restore for it the hegemony over the earth and the necks ...</seg>
<seg id="6"> My friends, what is their sin that they remain stranded for five weeks at the Rafah crossing without being allowed to enter Gaza? ...</seg>
<seg id="7"> Where are those sovereignty agreements and the commitment to them (as they claim)? ... Why are they lost between the accounts of Fatah and Hamas for authority? ... And which authority?</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abbas is asking the Zionist entity to allow those who are stranded at the Karam Abu Salim road to enter. ... But Hamas says no, and says this is not for their sake. ... But Abbas knows that among them are people wanted by the Zionist entity. ... It is an operation that means returning to direct Israeli control of the crossings (as if it does not exist). .... The sun is not covered by a filter!</seg>
<seg id="9"> I wonder here why the Egyptian government does not open the Rafah crossing and allow the stranded people to pass instead of remaining like this, not reaching either land or sky. .. Could not the Egyptian government do that on the basis of the agreements signed with the usurping entity?</seg>
<seg id="10"> I think it could if it wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Why are those people lost in acts of vengeance about an incomplete authority? ... Why don't we see an Arab movement seeking a solution to this matter to preserve the lives of 6,000 people ... who are standing with their hands raised up to God asking Him to release them from their imprisonment and to heal their fracture.</seg>

It provides us everything. Whatever we need we get. ...</seg>
<seg id="4"> Elections! There are no more honest, transparent, or pure elections, purer than milk.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Salaries! Egyptian citizens who are employees do not know how to spend their salary, on this or on that, because it is so large, which means it is enough for him and it is really bountiful ..</seg>
<seg id="6"> Health! My gosh! Health and hospitals in Egypt have no peer among their counterparts in Europe and the developed countries. You can even go in without an eye or a leg or a kidney and they will install a replacement for you without your saying or feeling anything. ..</seg>
<seg id="7"> I do not want to continue and say the accomplishments of the Egyptian government are clear and explicit and do not need clarification ... People! I protest and condemn this report. We should have gotten first place among the peoples pleased with their peoples. Also, the percentage of 87% is not ours and is alien to us. We have a certain well-known percentage in the whole world that we do not exceed or fall short of, namely 99.9% I do not know where this report got these falsified percentages that it reported. ...

<p>
<seg id="2"> Papers of a Lifetime. Monday 7/23/2007 .. Revolution Day!</seg>
<seg id="3"> President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak gave a speech celebrating the anniversary of this glorious revolution -- those are not my words, but they appeared on the screen with the speech. During the speech, the president spoke as if to say that his regime is an extension of the July Revolution. But that is not true since the revolution came to a complete end with the end of the October War. ..</seg>
<seg id="4"> As the great Egyptian poet Sayyid Hijab said yesterday, "The revolution ended when Muhammad Abd al-Ghani al-Gamasi emerged from the negotiations tent at Kilometer 101 crying and saying that President Sadat was conceding more than what was required by the constraints of the military situation. .. *** On the same day -- and this is an ongoing process that becomes more intense with each anniversary of the revolution -- the official channels and the government newspapers launch a violent campaign against everything the revolution represents.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I am not concerned here with my own opinions about the revolution and its accomplishments or my personal position on Abdel Nasser, that immortal leader. The obvious question for any ordinary citizen is: If this bygone odious government, which the regime's media curses night and day, is the original, then what is the current regime but an extension of it, as the head of the regime emphasizes. Why does the regime remain?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Of course, achievements in the infrastructure are not a suitable answer to this question after the recent revolution of the thirsty. .. But let's be very reassured: the infrastructure at the resorts of Marina is magnificent, the water is abundant, and thank God!</seg>
<seg id="7"> *** Thinking is endless, and resolve has become necessary. ..</seg>

<seg id="2"> Al-Azhar University?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Al-Shabiba - Occupied Gaza: Recent days have witnessed a succession of attacks by the Hamas security forces against a number of places, shops, people, and employees. The security campaign came from the Hamas movement against the institutions and employees of the National Authority and against families and weddings in several areas.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The most prominent attack targeted al-Azhar University, which tends away from the dominance of Hamas. It is the neighbor of the Islamic University, but it does not fly the green flag, and it seems that it refuses to raise the white flag. The attack was preceded by a threat to the president of the university to take down the Fatah flags that were flying at some locations in the university.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Because the demand was not carried out, it was attacked, in an unprecedented challenge, especially since the Hamas movement had previously asserted that it would not infringe upon educational and instructional institutions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> But since national pay day, Hamas security forces have moved towards escalation and intimidation, directed towards anyone who is committed to the directives of the official government and rejects the civil government of Hamas. It targeted some of leading figures in the official institution. All this is nothing but a clear and obvious expression of stumbling that will increase as the days pass. .. The accounts of palaces do not and will not match the accounts of villages!</seg>

<seg id="2"> Vampires of Talents</seg>
<seg id="3"> The commentary by the writer with the weeping pen, brother Fares el-Mamlaka, about the theft of his works by a blogger caught my eye.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At first I did not believe it, but I went back and started researching the subject of intellectual property +theft on Google. I was stunned by the many hits, more than 200,000, ranging from protection laws to incidents, news, and complaints.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I merely perused them, and although I had heard about many of these incidents, I never paid much attention to them until the brother writer with the weeping pen came along and made me look at the facts, which made me rethink the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For more about the case of the brother weeping pen, please go to the link http://fareselmamlaka.maktoobblog.com/</seg>
<seg id="7"> The issue of theft is serious. It is rejected by the Islamic religious code and the law, as well as reasonable people for that matter.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is an action which, even if beneficial today, won't be useful to him on Judgment Day, and maybe he will be +exposed one of these days sooner or later. There are many examples of it, and I don't think that the issue of theft is limited to professionals and aberrant people. It has become an enjoyable practice to reckless young people and those looking for quick fame. ..</seg>
<seg id="9"> Add to this the fact that the issue has gone beyond this and entered our universities and schools, as well as the media and government departments, including employees and cultured elites, some of whom have become prominent by means of this practice. As for commerce and business, it has been discussed at length, and such practices are used day and night. Every second, ideas, inventions, and research are being stolen all over the world, and the perpetrators are intelligence men, professional thieves, cultured or political elites, or businessmen.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Those vampires of talents and thieves of intellectual property are expanding their business in complete freedom and in spite of the strictness of the law. But the repression of conscience was the main reason for the spread of such practices, particularly since fame and prominence have become economic resources for the individual in a world where resources are dwindling. Not an hour goes by without a new star, a great critic, a daring journalist, and a smart politician surfacing, over whom the satellite channels, the newspapers, and the magazines duel to make him the topic of the hour in an age when others are running out of time.</seg>

There is no power and might except in God. .. After all this, you can go back to shutting your eyes as you face Mecca in the middle of the night and pray: God, comfort Iraq and its people for their affliction.

<seg id="3"> This was the first time I went to a camp in my life.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After a long 16 hour trip, the terror from the train disappeared after we arrived in Cairo. We arrived on Friday and we stayed at Mubarak International Hotel in front of the stadium. We were housed four to a room, all of us from Alexandria. I headed for the bed by the window. We then met the management of the camp. Then there was a get-acquainted session with young men from three other governorates, Suhaj, Aswan, and Bani Suwayf. The day ended, but of course we did not sleep. We went into town. How beautiful it was! We were supposed to return at 12:00, but who's talking? We are from Alexandria. We returned at 3:30 AM. Yes, OK, we heard a couple of words, that's normal. From the second day there was one routine until the end of the camp. Woke up at 7:00 AM in a stifling atmosphere. It was March and the weather was very hot. Morning workout in the stadium from 8:00 to 9:00 AM: run around the track, tighten your +abs, relax your leg. Afterwards, breakfast at 9:00 AM, some fava beans, a piece of cheese, two loaves of bread, a cup of tea. At 10:00 AM the work begins. We broke into 4 committees: bylaws, environment, evaluation, and cultural, which was my own. We made an internal structure and I presented myself as a candidate for editor-in-chief of the committee's magazine, and I won +by sweeping 11 votes versus 4 for Karam, the guy from Suhaj. The committees gave presentations from 11 to 12 each day thereafter. Each day there was a specific political, economic, or social subject. We split into 4 areas and we trained with a supervisor on how to discuss, research, and find information on the topic, and we present it to the guest, a doctor in his specialty. After lunch, from 3:00 to 4:00 and from 7:00, the +committees worked until 9:00. Then there was a free trip in town until 12:00 officially -- 2:30 unofficially -- and of course discussions with the young men of the governorates and university doctors. Splendid.</seg>

<seg id="3"> As part of the proposed projects by the local committee for the National Initiative for Human Development in Tahila, the Governor of the District of Taza visited the city of Tahila on Monday July 23, 2007 to launch work on the projects financed by the National Initiative for Human Development Fund.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Among the projects that were focused on: The project for the construction of commercial stores for peddlers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The following is a technical specifications sheet for the project: Site: The municipal market in the business district.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Targeted group: Peddlers in Tahila.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Components of the project: 45 commercial stores, a security guard center, toilets for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Covered Surface: 323 square meters.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Financing source: The National Initiative for Human Development Fund (400,000 dirhams), provincial budget (600,000 dirhams), the urban community of Tahila (the land).</seg>
<seg id="10"> Expected duration for project completion: 4 months.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Sidek Company in Temara won the deal.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The unit cost per commercial store is 22,200 dirhams.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The General Secretariat of the governorate will oversee the follow-up process.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The inauguration ceremony was attended by the President of the Municipal Council, some members and representatives of the local committee for Human Development, members of the revitalization team of the al-Quds neighborhood, and bureau chiefs.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Some citizens were surprised by the attendance of their representatives, despite the problems that the management of local affairs in Tahila has faced.</seg>
<seg id="16"> A question still to be answered is how will these commercial stores be distributed?</seg>
<seg id="17"> What are the criteria for assignment?</seg>
<seg id="18"> And finally, what are the chances of success of this project that was devised in the absence of those concerned?</seg>
<seg id="19"> The conditions for success of a commercial project depend on selecting the appropriate site.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Is the empty lot behind the municipal market suitable?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Does the municipal market have the popularity and acceptance that can contribute to the popularity of the commercial stores for peddlers?</seg>

<seg id="3"> </seg>
<seg id="4"> A Call to Serious Dialogue. Hello to all of you. This is a question I would like to pose. Why?</seg>
<seg id="5"> The reasons are many, the answers different. Each person has his own view. .. But in the end, we must have a convincing answer that prevails over the rest of the answers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> My question is: Why is the forbidden always desirable?</seg>
<seg id="7"> </seg>
<seg id="8"> A child plays only with what is forbidden. In the yard he goes only to whatever is forbidden, and he likes to eat only all the sweets and the chips that are forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="9"> A young man and a young woman in their adolescent years have no interest but to break all the barriers to what is forbidden in order to do the forbidden, regardless of the results and consequences.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A girl is prohibited from going on the internet, yet she goes, indifferent to rebuke, and she goes on text messaging to talk to every Tom, Dick, and Harry.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A young man spends a long time on the streets making passes, courting, and befriending bad company, indifferent to any blame that may come later on.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Any commodity that is forbidden in the markets, we find ourselves on the hunt searching for it, and we pay twice its price to obtain it.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Why is everything forbidden desirable?</seg>

<seg id="2"> Vision. My sister came to me to tell me about a dream she had in her sleep. She said, "I saw you getting ready to travel to an Arab country, me and a group of girlfriends. You were part of a group of exchange students, and you were quickly getting ready to travel. You were with one of the girls, and she looked closer to you than the others. You were happy and excited because you would be traveling. It ended. Now I know!</seg>
<seg id="3"> Travel = a new life, and in fact I am embarking on a new life. What good news!</seg>
<seg id="4"> I'm almost positive. As to the girl who seemed closer to me than the rest of the girls, during a phone call to one of my girlfriends, I discovered that she works at the place where I had applied for a small job. What a world!</seg>
<seg id="5"> I felt that this place was really suitable for her, but when I talked to her .. she appeared annoyed and bored with the place, and I knew it. I met many officials there and she was not aware of that. I follow a prophetic policy that the Messenger recommended: "Seek the help of silence in carrying out business." And that is what I did. When the thing becomes official and I am selected, I will then tell her everything :)</seg>

<seg id="2"> Financial Safeguards Bureau!</seg>
<seg id="3"> For the establishment of a Financial Safeguards Bureau with absolute neutrality and independence!</seg>
<seg id="4"> There go our esteemed representatives having now finished the second assembly session of the 11th legislative season, .. after fierce rounds of political discussions that were for the most part heated and occasionally smooth, and which ended, thank God, in approving the country's general budget for next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I had really wished that the Financial Safeguards Law would be approved since it is one of the toughest and most important tools for combating corruption in Kuwait, and would undoubtedly be a means to establish the principle of integrity and transparency and to prevent administrative and executive irregularities and transgressions in all sectors of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This law would be akin to the dividing line between clean safeguards and honorable trust on one hand, and dishonorable fraud and administrative corruption on the other.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlawful profiteering is an objectionable attribute in any society which attaches itself to its perpetrator no matter what. It permeates to become an inseparable part of him. It contributes to creating class and social disparities that are very negative and detrimental. It may lead to unwanted consequences inside society, not to mention the idea that stealing the funds and resources of the state is everyone's legitimate right! ..</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is truly unfortunate and disgraceful at the same time that the discussion and approval of this law was postponed under the pretext of the National Assembly's packed schedule of hearings and other things on the Assembly's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I hope that we won't have to wait long and see the approval of the Financial Safeguards Law at the next assembly session, and God willing, at its first meeting next October, .. that is, before the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In closing, we must very rationally ... see to it that the agency which will be implementing this law is neutral and fully and completely independent from the government, similar to the reputable Audit Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="11"> How nice it would be to call it the Financial Safeguards Bureau so it becomes an important pillar of our free democratic society and an important civilized foundation for integrity and transparency in the State of Kuwait.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> They are devastating the trees on the main road that cuts the city of Najran in two. We found out that the municipality of the region cut the ornamental trees.</seg>
<seg id="3"> They did not cut down the whole tree, but left the trunk and some branches without the leaves and the greenery, and the shade that had been there for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The view has become so ugly it is as if we were in the fall season.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I don't think there is an obvious reason for this behavior because I found the cut trees thrown in the middle of the road until they dried.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even if there was a justification for doing this, what is the point of leaving the trees the way they are?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Is it their thinking that they will return to their former state?</seg>
<seg id="8"> .</seg>
<seg id="9"> I don't know much about the business of growing ornamental trees, but is it possible for them to return to the way they were if their limbs were cut?</seg>
<seg id="10"> But the general appearance of the road is missing the beautiful green color and +some of the coolness that those trees imparted to the road, especially during the burning summer season.</seg>
<seg id="11"> What will they add?</seg>
<seg id="12"> I don't know. .. All I know is that they are cutting the trees!</seg>
<seg id="13"> Another point that the citizen and the visitor to the region notice is the bad paving of the road itself, specifically after the recent projects during which the road was dug up more than once.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The road was dug up once or twice or even three times, and was not returned to the way it was.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The road has really become like glass that cannot be repaired after it is broken.</seg>
<seg id="16"> People are complaining every day about that road to the point that the municipality is either not paying attention or is deliberately ignoring it more than once.</seg>
<seg id="17"> I saw a few machines a few days earlier working on patching the potholes in the road as a kind of hint that repairing the road and paving it completely will only be in the distant future, if it ever happens.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Woman Between Homemaking and Man's Domination</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Woman Between Homemaking and Man's Domination</seg>
<seg id="3"> Eastern societies differ in their customs and traditions from Western societies. ...</seg>
<seg id="4"> Perhaps one of the most powerful reasons for the backwardness of Eastern societies is the fact that they cling to most of these customs that have nothing to with either religion or morality.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Among these extant customs is the misconception vis-à-vis woman, that she should be the servant of the house, from cooking and preparing food to cleaning the house, washing dishes, and laundering and ironing clothes. This is the reality in most countries of the Middle and Near East. The man does not know how to cook, clean the house, wash clothes, or do any other house chores. Rather, he considers these to be the woman's job, whether she is a mother, a sister, a wife, or a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The woman, regardless of her job outside the house, whether she is an office worker or laborer or holder of advanced degrees, must be a good housewife. So we find the woman employee doing the house chores after returning from work, and often she prepares the next day's meals at night. .. Holidays are an opportunity for the woman employee to do the chores that accumulated during the work week. If we were to run a calculation and compute a woman's work hours outside the house, then add to them the work hours at home, we would find that the poor thing has not enjoyed a single vacation day, not even once a year.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This is the way it is for the woman who works outside the home. As for the housewife, one who does not work, she too suffers from not enjoying any vacation at all, working from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to sleep. ..</seg>
<seg id="8"> As for the male master, he enjoys an exemption from house chores. All he has to do is work outside the house. .. Whenever he's at home, he gives orders and prohibitions, and all his requests are answered. If only he were content and satisfied! Rather, you'll find him always grumbling; the food is not to his liking, the clothes were not washed well, and so forth with his unfounded protests, as if he was dealing with a servant working for him.</seg>
<seg id="9"> What is the reason for this prevailing phenomenon among most Eastern peoples? Is it a religious legacy? Or is it a customary social tradition?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it the man who forced the woman into this? Or is it the woman herself who gave the man power over her and made him a master?</seg>
<seg id="11"> With respect to religion, and in accordance with what is allowed and established in public and in private, the responsibility of running the household falls on the man. ... Either he does this himself or he hires himself a worker for service.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Religion did not impose housework on the woman. Rather, if the wife gives birth to a newborn, the father must arrange for a wet nurse for it. If its mother nurses it, he has to obtain her approval or she will demand payment for nursing. The same goes for the nanny.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The issue, then, is no more than the product of customs and traditions, .. and perhaps it was poverty that helped it spread and become universally practiced. During most eras man has gone +through, and even in this day and age, because the husband cannot afford to pay a worker at home since he can barely provide food, and since the woman was in most cases not working, she joined forces with the man to cooperate with him. He works to provide a livelihood and she works at home. This was a good move by the woman to help alongside the man. .. But this help was exploited by the man, and over successive generations it became a social law.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This was not limited to the needy only. It extended to the affluent also. The man has come to feel that he is entitled to have the woman serve him and provide his household needs. So can the woman, after conceding this to the man and accepting it, free herself from this dilemma? And does the man recognize that he has wronged the woman?</seg>
<seg id="15"> First, it is up to the woman herself to demand her right to equality with the man. Second, the man must be cognizant of this matter and truly feel that the woman is completely equal to him. And since we are calling for the woman's complete equality with the man, we also call on the man to share with the woman in the vital responsibility inside and outside the house, as is the case in most countries of the West. This way, neither the man nor the woman will be the master in the home. Instead, they will both be partners in everything.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Institutional Work</seg>
<seg id="3"> There are many effective leaderships which generate a lot of creativity in many operational, professional, technical, and political areas.</seg>
<seg id="4"> They establish rules, conceive theories, and draw up visions for the future .. according to sound and thoughtful plans. These programs and plans require long hours, great efforts, and huge amounts of money. Then comes the mechanism for implementing these projects, plans, ideas, suggestions, and theories and making them a reality.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After devoting great effort, painstaking labor, and huge amounts of money to them they get implemented and turned into a reality over a period that is long or short. We are surprised overnight .. that these ideas and plans have come to naught; this suggestion was eliminated or that activity has come to naught. When we look at the reasons</seg>
<seg id="6"> behind the disappearance of these programs or plans or projects, it becomes clear that the leaders who had embraced this idea have vanished for one reason or another.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Some examples of that are the +idea of the activity that was extinguished with the departure of the esteemed Dr. Mohamed al-Rashid, the +idea of pioneer schools which vanished with the departure of some of the supervisors at the Ministry, ..</seg>
<seg id="8"> and the +idea of the sources of learning on which the Ministry spent millions of riyals, and which so far has not been activated optimally considering the amounts spent on it. ..</seg>
<seg id="9"> There was also the +idea of the electronic government that was embraced by his Highness Prince Muqrin bin Abd al-Aziz, who was interested in putting it into action and who held +several press meetings about it, as well as an administrative meeting with the heads of all the civilian and military sectors. Businessmen also participated in these meetings ..</seg>
<seg id="10"> in the region of Medina. With the departure of Prince Muqrin, the idea did not disappear, but interest in it was no longer what it was previously.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Also among the new ideas was the +idea of the new mail that bore the slogan "An Address without Roundabout Ways" which was embraced by the General Mail Agency and whose implementation was started in many of Medina's neighborhoods. The distribution and installation of boxes at houses began with coverage of nearly 60% of Medina's neighborhoods.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In my mind, this idea has not been thoroughly studied, and many of our writers have written about it in the local newspapers. It would be more appropriate if the residential neighborhoods are surveyed, and only then numbered, and mail service later offered for those who wish. .. But what happened is a clear waste of the Agency's funds .. since most of the boxes that were installed at the houses have been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In any case, we need disciplined team institutional work. It is institutional work that applies a future vision for all programs, projects, systems, or decisions. .. Then the valid ones are approved .. after ample study by the experts.</seg>
<seg id="14"> With this +institutional work, no program or project is affected by the departure of some person or the arrival of another .. because the work is determined according to a specific mechanism, controls, and clearly apparent strategies.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Fatigue and Exertion</seg>
<seg id="3"> A person needs a certain amount of effort to improve his performance, but excessive exertion leads to many negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Exertion is a state of fatigue that results from physical, illness-related, or psychological fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Fatigue and exertion are dangerous things which can lead to the destruction of civilizations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Man is not supposed to get tired and exert a colossal effort at his work without rest.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The need for rest after work is like the need for food.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Fatigue hurts man by lowering endurance, allowing circumstances to overwhelm him, and allowing everything to become colossal in front of him while he becomes a dwarf before everything.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Fatigue is the principal gateway to physical illness.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Fatigue and exhaustion lead to an increase in hormones in the blood. Among those hormones is adrenaline, which causes an increase in blood pressure, and hormones that lead to a breakdown of the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="11"> This fatigue may be linked to other diseases such as diseases of the stomach and the intestines, influenza, herpes, and certain types of cancer. ..</seg>
<seg id="12"> Among the signs of +exertion are an increase in the pulse, an increase in blood pressure, nervous tension, mental dullness, and lack of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to limit exertion, it is recommended to take carbohydrates at breakfast and limit laxatives, which cause the loss of vitamins A and D, which leads to exertion and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="5"> It is the memory that continues to occupy a standing in my heart in spite of my insistence that it disappear. But it appears at moments like this to keep me awake and spoil my happiness.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Fact of the Matter. The fact of the matter is that I can no longer begin reading a book of literary criticism, fiction, or poetry because I fear falling into a vortex of hallucinations or wild imaginings, i.e. ramblings and ignorance, i.e. stupidity, let alone the philosophizing of the psychologically disabled, i.e. the cultured idiots.</seg>
<seg id="3"> As I read about the fact of the matter and my own situation, I also have come to fear entering into a conversation with someone because I dread the barricades of ideas behind which the interlocutors hide. I also dread those unique cases of ignorance that has become sacred and cannot be touched, in the sense that ignorance has become a reputable façade.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I no longer can visit any art exhibit because I fear getting injured in the eye on account of the stupidity of the panting behind a stupid observer who claps with his eyes in astonishment and whose opinion is the same in everything.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i.e. he knows everything.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I fear these contorted styles, i.e. those exposed for the theft of art work and this prompt aiming at a buyer who savors oil, perfumes himself with gas, and dreams of gases.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But what scares me more are these pretty shapes that come from nature (either wood or stone) which some being cleans the clean dust from them to add to them the dirt of his name, so they become in the opinion of the vexing ones, i.e. the critics, a work of stupendous creativity to be added to the overstuffed cultural memory, i.e. bloated from the rot or the feed of lies that is covered by the moss of moist intellect.</seg>
<seg id="8"> I still fear writing out of fear of a reader for whom the meaning of the written word is what he understands it to be and not the meaning intended by the word, and I still write a question that whispers screaming: Toward what reality are we walking in one direction as if we have shut all the directions and settled on silence?</seg>

<seg id="4"> When you grow up in a beautiful country and a beautiful home, and you see beauty and cleanliness everywhere, this will be reflected in the quality of your productivity -- and I would not be exaggerating if I said even on the quantity of that productivity -- in addition to creating a kind of love of creativity that is engendered by this culture, a society that has no mercy on those who fail.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is difficult to find disguised unemployment or patronage in the West. This is a compelling incentive for each individual to improve his productivity and acquire new skills that allow him to work, earn a living, and enjoy life, which, as I mentioned above, you cannot enjoy without the money that comes only from serious and hard work and the acquisition of skills.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Consequently, we find a persistent quest by workers to advance in their work. This does not happen by fiddling around. Rather, it comes by you putting something into your work. But if you knew that your creativity and increased productivity wouldn't benefit you at all, you would be frustrated and you would abandon the idea to begin with, and leave advancement to people with patronage who, as soon as they assume a post that is not suitable for them, become a destructive force in their workplace. God only knows the pile of social problems.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Of course, the social problems that surround any human being stifle his imagination and creativity, let alone his basic abilities to work correctly. But some will say that Western society is raging with the problems of divorce, fragmentation, and emotional collapse. I'll say this is true, but it does not exaggerate the problem, and it does not pursue him all his life as it does in our societies when looks follow you everywhere and no gathering fails to talk about you if you have problems.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The nature of familial cohesion in our societies increases the pressures on you, while the indifference of their societies removes these problems from your shoulders, which keeps you in a good productive mode, or it has a partial impact that quickly fades away. God only knows. To be continued, God willing. ...................</seg>

<seg id="1"> Do Not Starve Our Children to Death</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Sami al-Akhras: The lion extended its authority and influence, showed off its power, dug its claws into the heart of the country, and killed everyone to make itself king in a forest without vegetation, where there is no water and no grass, a forest that is only saved from being a desert by refugee camps crammed together. Destiny wanted them to carry their tents to the deserts of Gaza and to be crammed together in the human containers made by the International Aid Agency.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the middle of the forest the triumphant lion is waiting confused, wondering what to do with these mouths and these wounded predators that are looking for something to feed them and silence the screams of their hungry children.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The wounded lion waits and roars whenever it gets the chance to make known its existence and that it is still there, steadfast and standing on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Between the triumphant lion of Gaza and the wounded lion of the Bank, the mill turns and grinds everything. Decisions and decrees come continually from both of them, each looking for its legitimacy that is usurped every day by the occupation with its planes and tanks, legitimacy propped up on the dead bodies and blood of a whole nation, and a cause standing in the face of storms of death and uprooting.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In the turmoil of legitimacy the prime minister who was assigned to lead the emergency government, Salam Fayyad, who is considered an economist who deals with situations according to a certain economic vision through which he imitates the emotions of the hungry who are prey to hunger and poverty, whose only source for keeping their children alive is their salaries which have been subjected to erosion during the previous period, the period of democracy, and the two-headed legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Let's go back to the origin of the story, the beginning of the tale. We all acknowledge, confirm, and assert that employment operations are carried out in accordance with the qualification credentials you get from the party, and the color of your party flag, so that academic credentials are not taken into consideration and do not indicate qualification. That is because of our universities, which no longer grant academic degrees without including party affiliation on them. That is a mistake for which they will not be forgiven. It went beyond this note in the certificate. They ignored the fact that it is more important than the note of the grade with which the student graduates.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Prime Minister Salam Fayyad issued a decision to terminate employment contracts that were made during the last two years. This decision did not explain the reasons why it was issued. Was it issued as a slap to the dismissed government? Or as part of a comprehensive process of reform of the employment situation?</seg>
<seg id="9"> If it was issued as a slap to the dismissed government then the slap  came down hard on the face of the children of the employees, because the salaries of the dismissed prime minister, the ministers, the members of the government, the members of al-Qassam, the members of the executive, and all the government and party retinue are secure and guaranteed with incentives, bonuses, reimbursement for incidental expenses, reimbursement for transportation, hazard pay, mission compensation, driving compensation, reimbursement for psychological, social, and health insurance, clothing compensation, and reimbursement for rich meals  containing calories and protein. I guarantee that they will not be affected and that they will sleep at night happy, warm, and assured.</seg>
<seg id="10"> If, on the other hand, it was employment reform, here all the question marks and exclamation marks, along with the other punctuation marks will not be enough to wonder, what reform?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Is reform punishing the children of employees because of the affiliation of their parents? or punishing children because they are children of contract employees?</seg>
<seg id="12"> I beg your pardon, Prime Minister Salam Fayad. Keep your battle away from the screams of the hungry children and the humiliated father. You must reconsider this dangerous decision. Do not kill our children in the name of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Have mercy on our people. ... Have mercy on your kinsmen. ... Spare the children of the future from death, hunger, and hatred. .... The aroma of grilled and fried food emanates from the kitchens of those you want to punish, and the aroma of delicious food rises on the sound of the waves of the sea. ... The ones who writhe with hunger are the children of those employees. ....... Have mercy on those who are on earth and you will be shown mercy by the one who is in heaven.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> I do not have +any objection if the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice falls under the umbrella of the Ministry of Interior and specializes only in the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice without any additional authorities .. on the condition that each member of it receives advanced training in ways of dealing with people and ways of calling them to virtue and preventing them from vice.</seg>
<seg id="3"> They will be trained through basic military training .. And their appearance will be unified, as is the case with the uniform of the Mujahideen ..</seg>
<seg id="4"> With the exclusion of anyone with a criminal record who has previously been employed by the Committee .. and with the exclusion of anyone who has two jobs ..</seg>
<seg id="5"> There is no objection to increasing their salaries considering first the importance of their job and their availability to do one job .. with these conditions one can accept the work of the Committee ..</seg>
<seg id="6"> What led me to say this is the secret circular that was recently sent by the Ministry of Interior .. to the emirates of the regions and other concerned parties.  It was also distributed in Internet discussion groups such as forums ..</seg>
<seg id="7"> The main point of it was to stop any person even if he were in the Committee's centers .. and hand him over immediately to the police or other concerned security groups ..</seg>
<seg id="8"> And also preventing his interrogation or taking his confession in whatever way it may be .. and whoever violates this from among the Committee's members will be stopped immediately ..</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this way, the Committee will become another police .. but with no authority .. its task is only to arrest the violator .. It is now better for it to give up this role .. and make itself available to preach about God in the best manner, as long as is stripped of its most important power, which it used to enjoy and fight for. At this time, maybe people will accept it as a preaching group like any other one .. Yes.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Maybe some of those from whom the Committee only took pledges and then released will be harmed .. But this is also an error that the Committee fell into because it is based on a defect that follows the people's sins from the beginning .. but any violator regardless of who he may be should get his punishment without any discrimination .. Like anyone arrested by the police or the investigation unit or others ..</seg>

<seg id="1"> Photos of Half-Naked Saudi Women and Playing with Our Money in Aramco's American Office. Photos.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Through its office in the United States in the state of Texas, Saudi Aramco generously donated what amounts to 25 million dollars to build homes for some of the residents of the state of Louisiana who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. This was done at a time when some members of the Saudi community are living under the poverty line and the rest are in debt.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Before that, it donated five million dollars cash for the same reason.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Saudi Aramco also celebrates the national holiday of the state of Texas on February 22 of each year, which costs thousands of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Why does this concern us when the national Texas holiday has made all our days sad ones???</seg>
<seg id="6"> Why would Aramco donate five million dollars cash to the Americans affected by hurricane Katrina??</seg>
<seg id="7"> Why would Aramco donate 25 million dollars to build houses for those affected by hurricane Katrina??</seg>
<seg id="8"> Why did Aramco donate the sum of 8,000 dollars to one of Texas's TV stations???</seg>
<seg id="9"> Why does Aramco annually sponsor the marathon race in Texas that is attended by contestants from all over the world when I have never before heard that it sponsored a sheep marathon in the Kingdom???</seg>
<seg id="10"> I wish I and others could find answers to these questions!!!!!!!!!! From Saudi Aramco officials and not from the Americans. The dirty American as an employee receives more in one salary plus the salaries of his father and grandfather in America. He is pampered and honored more than any other employee in the company, and he is not punished for any mistake he makes, as if he were above the law. He receives an astronomical salary, which if distributed to 7 poor Saudi families would be enough for them for a year. He is not good at his work, but he is blonde and blue-eyed and doesn't pray or fast. His wife attends any reception with him held by the officials who sign donation checks for poor Americans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</seg>
<seg id="11"> Aramco works on Westernizing the Saudi woman. Their magazines have started to show the Saudi woman in an unveiled manner and have thus begun the anti-veil phenomenon in a sneaky way. As for playing around in an obvious way, this occurs in putting the woman in jobs that require mixing with men, or as a secretary for immoral managers.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Its policy differs from that of the previous era. It used to respect the people, now it has begun to mock them.  It used to respect the legal system, now it has begun to violate it. It used to build schools for us with our money, now it stopped and has begun to build for the Americans and help the Americans......................................</seg>
<seg id="13"> Aramco has an office to support the charitable activities in the area and 99% of the donations go to Al Awamiah and Al Qatif and the retarded Shia and those with Shia needs, although the schools with Sunni needs are double what the Shia have!!!!!! The health programs in Sayhat, the associations of Al Qadih, and sports activities are for the Shia.  All that is allocated for the society has begun to disappear from Aramco, passing by Al Khubar and Al Dammam to reach Al Qatif-- and only for the Shia. Is there an answer, you who are in charge of activities????????</seg>
<seg id="14"> Or is this a confession that the petroleum is theirs and we are an imposition on them, as they say !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</seg>
<seg id="15"> I leave you now with pictures that were taken on the occasion of the national Texas holiday last month and were distributed among the employees of Aramco with captions. Everyone who saw them got upset with the company, knowing that there are many poor who need that money to be spent on them.  They are more important than the Christian Americans who support their government with taxes to prosecute and humiliate the Muslims and to oppress them and kill them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Happy birthday Texas, happy birthday Texas, happy birthday Texas. We are all your servants.</seg>

<seg id="1"> French Minister: Bush Behind 9/11 attacks??</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Internet website www.ReOpen911.info said that a prominent French political figure currently occupying the position of a minister in the government of President Nicholas Sarkozy insinuated last year that American President George Bush might have been behind the 9/11 attacks in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The website, which promotes conspiracy theories regarding the 9/11 attacks, posted a video of the French Minister of Housing and the City Christine Boutin, in which she doubts that the Al Qaeda organization led by Osama bin Laden orchestrated the attacks. Boutin's office tried to minimize the importance of these comments.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She was asked in an interview conducted with her last November before she became minister if she thought that Bush was behind the attacks, so Boutin said - "I think it is possible. I think it is possible."</seg>
<seg id="5"> Boutin supports this opinion by pointing to the large number of individuals who visit the websites that are suspicious of the official line regarding the 9/11 attacks on American cities.</seg>
<seg id="6"> She said - "I know that the websites that talk about this problem are websites that are visited by a high number of visitors... and I tell myself that this is a public expression... It cannot be without any validity."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Boutin's office tried to minimize the importance of her comments by saying that she said in a later part of the same interview- "I'm not telling you that I stand by this position. - And this comment does not appear in the video that was posted on the website."</seg>
<seg id="8"> A number of websites also ran the video within the last few days, and the story started to infiltrate the main media outlets.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Le Monde newspaper said in a main headline - "Christine Boutin Fell into the Trap of her Controversial Insinuations about 9/11."</seg>
<seg id="10"> Will the viewpoint of the Minister change after holding a position in Sarkozy's government, as the official's statement is accounted for and is not considered a normal statement that can pass easily.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Decrease of Gulf Tourists to Syria Affects Income of Apartment Owners and Taxi Drivers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Decrease of Gulf Tourists to Syria Affects the Income of Apartment Owners and Taxi Drivers .... and Goods Sellers .... Damascus (Sabaq) Aaid Al Ghamdi: Many travelers to Syria have faced problems as a result of being subjected to theft, cheating, and fraud by gangs whose priority is to track people of various nationalities and follow them and attack them. In some cases, this has led to murder and theft. Most of the cases are focused on citizens of the Gulf states, which caused them to be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This pattern of events recently has made many people, especially those from the Gulf, shy away from traveling to spend this year's summer break in Syria as they used to do in the past few years. Their destination has changed this year to other countries, seeking safety for themselves and their possessions and hoping to enjoy their summer vacation.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Some Saudi newspapers published a number of cases in which travelers were subjected to imprisonment with no reason, in addition to incidents of murder inside apartments and other places.</seg>
<seg id="5"> During a tour by (Sabaq) of the Syrian capital, Damascus, we met a number of professionals who had a direct relationship with tourists and those coming to Syria. Their work activity is affected during the summer and their income is affected by the tourist directly, as the summer time is considered a hot season for them. Among those are taxi drivers and owners of apartment rental offices in addition to owners of barber shops, commercial stores and goods sellers. Their comments were that this summer was extremely bad, especially concerning visitors from the Arab Gulf states. One taxi driver, when we were riding with him said: "You are the first Gulf person who rides with me for a month," pointing out that during the past years he used to work all day long during the whole summer season, and that most of his clients were from the Gulf. He stressed that his income was affected this year due to the lack of tourists from the Gulf to the country.</seg>
<seg id="6"> One of the owners of a shop selling goods confirmed the same statement by saying: "The level of our sales decreased this year as a result of the few Gulf tourist shoppers.  Many used to come and buy different products when they came to Syria, and they took them to their countries when they went back."</seg>
<seg id="7"> As for a number of owners of real estate offices, they said: "The summer period used to be a hot season for renting apartments.  It was difficult to get a furnished apartment after one week of the beginning of the season.  The majority of the furnished apartments this year are vacant and are being offered for the lowest prices to renters whose numbers are still very few.</seg>
<seg id="8"> One of the owners of a real estate office added: In past years, an owner of an office was the one who picked the apartments for the clients and the prices were really good. This year it is the client who chooses the right apartment and gives the prices that he likes. In spite of that, offices compete to attract him because of the low number of tourists coming to Syria this year, especially from Gulf countries.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> England Honors Marcel Khalifah and the Beatles?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Last July 14, Lebanese artist Marcel Khalifah participated in a concert in Liverpool with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the city of the Beatles and the city of John Lennon, where even the airport bears the name of this artist.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The concert was held at the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool at the end of a five day long annual Arab Cultural Festival that hosts an Arab well-known in the arts each year.  This year, it honored Khalifah.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He gave another concert at Saint George Hall in Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="6"> During the concert, Khalifah played the oud and performed audio segments and was accompanied by his sons Rami on the piano and Bashhar on percussion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Arab Philharmonic evening had two parts: the first was a piano concerto composed by the Lebanese Abdallah Al Masri, then an Andalusian suite for the oud and the Orchestra of Marcel Khalifah with the pieces: Al Zaghareed, Granada, Qadk Al Myas, and O Girls of Alexandria.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The orchestra was led by Maestro Clark Rondel. These two concerts were attended by more than 3000 people who came to listen to this new music in Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Khalifah said that the mayor of Liverpool, Clark Takis, greeted him during this event, and in a speech welcoming him, described the Lebanese artist as one of the contemporary musician whose music expresses humanity with its transparency and comprehensiveness. He said his participation with the Philharmonic orchestra left a deep and a big impression on them.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Lebanese artist will conclude his summer tour in Europe and the Arab World, is scheduled to play on July 30 with the Oman Symphony Orchestra in Muscat with the famous Indian violinist, Subramaniam.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Khalifah will also take part in the Festival of European Youth which will be held in Berlin on August 10 under the leadership of Maestro Simon Wright. He will also participate on August 25 with the [Obsolete] Orchestra under the leadership of the American Maestro Christian Gervet in a concert that will be held at the Kennedy Center in New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Of these tours and engagements, Khalifah said "I present my work with these world orchestras in the East and West out of love, so that these works will be an echo and a tale in which I express my doubt and my certainty. Frankly, I reflect myself through them, supporting my country without belonging to any side."</seg>
<seg id="13"> Khalifah added "I represent my country in my own way, and maybe through my music, I represent the secular and democratic Lebanon, a new Lebanon- far from sectarianism, favoritism and dependence."</seg>
<seg id="14"> Khalifah presented his works previously as part of the Spring of Music in the city of Nancy in northern France with [Gradius] Symphonic Orchestra led by Francois [Legi] and before that with the Italian Philharmonic Orchestra in Milan lead by Carl Martin.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Carthage Festival Prefers Its Own People +This Year?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Carthage's amphitheater was built in the beginning of the 2nd century and has witnessed a number of changes in the 3rd and 4th centuries before it was demolished in 439 by the Vandals. The circumference of the amphitheater, reaches 106 meters on the slope of the Odeon plateau, and its height is more than 50 meters. Its small openings in the background were decorated with tall statues, while the whole altar was built from white marble and ["kadhal" stone].</seg>
<seg id="4"> It used to accommodate more than 11,000 spectators and a big part of it was demolished and then gradually covered by debris.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In the year 1904 it was discovered by the explorer Gauckler.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since 1967, it was renovated to host the International Film Festival of Carthage which has become one of the most important and unique summer activities in the Tunisian cultural scene. It is now in its 43rd season, which will start tomorrow, Saturday, and will continue until August 16, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This year's season will have intensive participation by Tunisian artistic performers, especially after a decision stating that approximately 60% of the shows in all festivals should be Tunisian.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The most prominent Tunisian participations will be by Saber Al Rubai and Sofia Sadeq and Latifa Al Arfawi. These, it seems, are performances which were postponed from the previous season.</seg>
<seg id="9"> As for the other performances, one of them will be by the Moroccan artist Gad Al Maleh on July 31.</seg>
<seg id="10"> As for the Arab performances, part of them will be handled by the Festival through its agreement with the Rotana company as has been the case for more than the last three years.  This process however, has been facing fierce opposition, especially from the local press, because of the mix up that has become routine and expected, namely that a number of names are announced and then the list changes at the last minute or a bit after that.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Festival, led this year by Mr. Mohammad Raja Farhat, will take care of producing the opening and closing ceremonies, which has been a custom of the Festival for years.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The opening ceremony will be dedicated to offering samples of musical heritage and popular literature according to contemporary reading.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The closing ceremony will be dedicated to honoring a number of top talented individuals in the field of Tunisian music, many of whom we missed in the last period. It suffices to mention the great musician Ali Al Sariti and the late musician Abd Al Hamid Balaljiah and others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> It is worth noting that Tunis is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Republic this year. The evening of July 25 at the Festival of Carthage will be dedicated to this event, as a number of national songs will be presented with the participation of famous Tunisian voices such as: Lotfi Bushnaf, Sonia Mubarak, Shoukri Youzian, Sofia Sadeq, Laila Hjiej, Darsaf Al Hamdani and Rihab Al Sahgir...</seg>
<seg id="15"> Leading the team this evening is composer Hamadi ben Othman</seg>
<seg id="16"> The musical band will be led by Ahmad Ashour, leader of the Tunisian Symphonic Orchestra. He will be provided with a number of eastern instruments and a third of the best musicians in Tunisia.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Weddings in Falma, Between Running After Fashion and Skipping Traditions</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Weddings in Falma, Between Running after Fashion and Skipping Traditions</seg>
<seg id="3"> I said in yesterday's entry that the father of the groom or one of his relatives spends a whole week on the back of a horse to call people to come to his son's wedding. However, today with development happening so blindly, this custom, which used to increase social interconnection, has changed. It was replaced by ornate paper invitations that are sent via the mail or fax or hand-delivered. There are also the invitations via the phone without movement even if the guest was a few meters away in the same neighborhood or village.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As for the traditions of serving food for the male and female guests, these have changed according to fashion. It has become men who serve food to women, when the party's private section for women used to be far from the eyes of men. This happens with the absence of [beauticians] and those with golden figures whose job has become only to do the make-up and comb the hair and color the nails and change the loose and transparent clothes every hour, and dance constantly to the melodies of the DJ's equipment. The dishes come to them, and on top of them the dessert carried by the hands of men. This would not have been accepted by the men of yesterday, who were used to food preparation being done by women, leaving them to eat and enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Even the parties used to be held outside in front of the groom's house so that the old and the young could be happy and merry with the music of the wedding band, the flute and drums. Today it is happening inside halls and private ballrooms that are being rented for around five million. They are closed and the only thing you can only hear from them is the music of the DJ that is being blasted inside the ballroom, playing bands that have nothing to do with singing, that have rude and ridiculous lyrics. This spending and wasting of money has reached its peak, as even the wedding dishes are made of plastic and other material so that they can be thrown away directly after use. Back then, the dishes used to fill the houses of the big families and were used by the neighbors and the relatives. These expenses will increase the burden on the groom and his parents by putting them in debt, which they will remain paying off for many years.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Change has even touched the wedding night, so instead of the couple spending their wedding night at the family's house at the end of the evening when the guests leave [outside] - as it is said here - and what is left is the parents of the bride and the groom. Now everyone prefers the hotels so as to rent rooms there, and the high prices add to the other expenses.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Even the food is no longer only couscous and shorba or chakhchoukha but has been replaced with sweet dishes and olives and other food.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Commenting on this change that has touched the wedding traditions in Al Falmi, my uncle Muhammad, who is an 80-year old man, said after he sighed as if he were going back in time to the days of his youth, "I miss the old times and the weddings that used to be held for seven days. In our time, there was good intention, blessings and dignity."</seg>
<seg id="9"> Uncle Muhammad went on to talk about his wedding. He said "I was 17 back then when my dad married me. Did you know that the wedding took place while I was harvesting wheat and I did not rest until the day the bride showed up? I did not see her until the wedding night, yet our marriage has lasted until this day because the intention was to form a connected family where love and happiness would prevail. It is not like your generation, where you get married in the summer and divorced in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="10"> As for Hajja Fatima, who is 76 years old, she said when we asked her about weddings in the old times, the opinions of the bride or the groom never mattered when it came to decisions about the marriage.  For the groom was not even asked for his opinion to get engaged to someone because back then the parents picked the groom, and the clothes that the bride used to take to her house, and the wedding date.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Everything was simple in our time.  The dowry did not exceed 500 centimes and the bride's new wardrobe was mainly a hardcover and a small bag that had a pair of shoes. As for the wedding, it used to last seven days with its nights and its generosity and its drumming and flutes and fireworks, and as for the main dish in the old days, it was couscous and rafis. She said that at her wedding, her husband killed 24 goats to feed the guests. She said "They were unforgettable days and thank God we lived in understanding and happiness and did not have problems like your generation despite all the good things that God granted them, they are still unstable. The high number of singles - as we call them - among men and men is only an indication of fearing the unknown before getting married."</seg>

<seg id="4"> The diversity of styles of collecting votes differ from one candidate to the other. We see some of them setting up tents and providing food and bringing out the hookah and sometimes musical bands. Another one tours the election areas and passes by a funeral house and mourns the deceased so as to get the votes of the relatives of the deceased, and maybe the vote of the deceased himself. He then moves directly to a wedding hall to give congratulations for the wedding, another voter.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Some might resort to inventing marketing methods for their election campaign, like distributing pieces of candy that bear his name and picture. This might expose him to the danger of an increase in his blood sugar level if he loses the election.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Some others insist on taking on the election battle in spite of their certainty that they will not win, with the purpose of influencing one of the candidates and benefiting another one behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Most of the Arab candidates are not good at thinking or expressing themselves. However, they climb the platforms and the podiums to make statements about the availability of job opportunities and the increase in salaries and free elections. This makes us miss Al Sahhaf's statements about the American infidels, although Al Sahhaf did not commit any crime and was proficient in Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="8"> As soon as the elections end, the candidates draw the sword of taxes to behead the poor.  Then they sleep filled with the spices of the good food, and around them are the hearts of the low-income people that yearn for codfish and cured meat.</seg>
<seg id="9"> As for the presidential elections in our democratic countries that are referred to as fast food elections, these are the elections that have turned the citizens to mummies who go submissively to the ballot boxes to create an election triumph of 99%. This is a percentage that only saints and lords can get.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Occupation Authorities Deprive Child Aseel from Realizing Her Dream of Representing Palestinian Children in the Popular Debkah Dance Festival in Qatar, Salfeet - Maan.  Aseel breathed deeply while her tears streamed down her soft cheeks that were naturally red, thus adding beauty to the innocence of a child whom the occupation deprived of even her most basic human rights.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Aseel is a dreamy child full of life and vigor. She is 14 years old. She loved life and loved its beauty despite the dark days that her people go through. Aseel is a member of a local Debkah band in the city of Ramallah. She excelled and mastered her role skillfully. She hoped to participate in a festival that she will show through it her talents and her artistic ability.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Finally, the opportunity came for Aseel to travel to Qatar with her troupe to perform there, along with another performance in the city of Amman. Aseel could not contain her joy. She started running in the house, kissing her parents and her brothers. "My wish has come true and I will travel to perform Debkah and dance there. I will showcase the heritage of my country before the audiences of the Arab Gulf," she told her mother.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Aseel is a child of two parents who carry an identity card that was issued in Gaza city, and they live in the West Bank. Her family's home is in a village near Qalqilya. In the land of her father and grandfather there are tens of acres and hundreds of olive trees, whose roots hit the bottom of the ground and whose branches embrace the sky to testify that Aseel and her grandparents are here and will stay here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In a nation torn as a result of the occupation, the people of Gaza are required to obtain a permit to exit in coordination with the occupation army, to go to their place of residence in the West Bank, or else they will go back to Gaza and will not be able to return to the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Aseel's father approached the Civil Liaison Office of the occupation army to request a coordination request for his daughter to leave with the troupe, but the occupation authorities refused Aseel's request and did not allow her to leave with her troupe to participate in the Qatar Festival.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Aseel returned to her house in Ramallah cursing the occupation. Life is becoming darker before her innocent young face. What sin did she commit?</seg>
<seg id="9"> "Why didn't I travel with my troupe?"</seg>
<seg id="10"> "Why do they deprive us of our right to live like other peoples?" said Aseel while furious.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Al Zahhar reveals documents Showing 'Fatah' Leaders Embezzling Billions of the People's Money.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, Mahmoud Al Zahhar, displayed a number of documents and figures that were confiscated at the security headquarters that prove the financial and administrative corruption that Fatah leaders and the Palestinian Authority were involved in.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Al Zahhar said during a political meeting that was held last night in the big mosque at the Al Bureij camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip that Salam Fayyad is involved in cases of corruption, and Hamas has documents to prove that and will display them at the appropriate time.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He stressed that there are documents that prove that the central committee of the Fatah movement investigated Salim Al Zanoun, the head of the National Council, for embezzling 2 million dollars from the Palestinian people.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He also revealed a number of embezzlements and illegal exploitations of public money with numbers that prove the involvement of a number of Fatah's leaders including Nabil Abu Rudeina, the advisor of the late president of the Authority Arafat, and others.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Al Zahhar said in the meeting that was attended by a huge crowd of families and citizens: There are number of documents from the monitoring committee at the legislature in May 1997 that prove that financial corruption increased by 326 million and that Abu Rudeina received 33,000 dollars from Arafat as expenses for his daughters in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He explained that the Zionist occupation conducted an investigation, according to the documents, with one of the oil lords in the Zionist entity called Ofad Coco, who used to pay half a million shekels yearly to Mohammad Dahlan, and the same to the security in the West Bank and 400,000 shekels to Rashid, and that they are involved in bogus sales of bills.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Leaders of Hamas stressed that the policy of the Authority was based on a monopoly, and none of its transactions had been subjected to bids, especially in the sale of oil, fruit and other goods in order to divide the profits between the big officials at the apparatuses and the Authority's institutions.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The documents reveal the occupation's refusal to wire the amount of one million shekels to an official who used to receive from the revenues of the Al-Mintar crossing (Karni).  They added that the monitoring committee's report at the Executive Council in February 2006 showed the disappearance of 315 million dollars from the Authority's budget.  An investigation was ongoing regarding the other 700 million dollars that disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Al Zahhar read a number of documents and figures that prove the involvement of prominent leaders in Fatah's movement and the Authority in embezzlement crimes and illegal use of power for more than ten years.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Crocker's Warnings to Justify the Continuity of Occupation and Domination of the Oil Pie. Crocker: The violence happening in Iraq exceeds any expectation.  The American Ambassador in Baghdad, expects a total collapse of the Iraqi Security Forces under the weight of sectarian pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Occupied Baghdad - American Ambassador to Baghdad Ryan Crocker told the New York Times that the early departure of the American forces from Iraq or the withdrawal to bases inside of it could lead to a sharp increase in violence that could result in the death of thousands.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The newspaper said that Crocker's comments came in an interview that was conducted with him on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5"> These comments coincided with the increase in Iraqi leaders' fears that increased pressure on the American President George Bush will lead to the early withdrawal of the American forces.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Iraqi leaders from different sects warned on Monday that an early withdrawal of American forces might plunge the country into a total civil war.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Leaders commented on a detailed report to the newspaper about the increase of arguments inside the White House regarding a possible gradual decrease in the number of forces.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The White House denied the contents of the reports.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Regarding the possibility of an increase in violence should the American forces leave, Crocker said "We should look at the consequences and at those who say we can create rules in other parts of the country."</seg>
<seg id="10"> He added "Yes we can .. but there will be a possibility of the American forces stopping at the observer rule while civilians are butchered by the thousands. This is not a good possibility."</seg>
<seg id="11"> Crocker and the American Military General David Petraeus will present a report to the Congress in the middle of September regarding whether this big increase in the American forces managed to contain the violence in Iraq and if the Iraqi politicians in Iraq made progress regarding national reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It is expected that the US Congress this week will conduct an exciting discussion regarding the future and funding of the war before an important report on Iraq that the administration will present to the Congress by July 15.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Crocker said that he bases his report on what he noticed since having taken his position around four months ago, in addition to his previous experience in Iraq for more than 25 years, and the lessons learned from his work in the beginning of the eighties.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The New York Times quoted Crocker saying that the lack of the ability to imagine made it impossible to expect the violence that befell Lebanon when it slipped into civil war.</seg>
<seg id="15"> He added "I'm sure that what will happen here will exceed any expectation."</seg>
<seg id="16"> The newspaper said that Crocker presented a number of options in his presentation about the dangers resulting from the withdrawal of the American forces.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He said that this includes the possibility of the total collapse of the Iraqi forces, whose ranks have reached 350,000, under the weight of the sectarian pressures and its disintegration into militias.</seg>

<seg id="3"> London- A statement from the English-Arab Organization said that Nathmi Awji, the head of the Organization, asked the kidnappers of the British journalist Alan Johnston to release him for the sake of Palestine, the cause and the nation.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The British Alan BBC. And the Organization's statement said that the impact of the kidnapping of correspondent Al Johnston was still causing tumult and objections internationally, especially in the arenas of speech and opinion. Nor was that the only such case: it had already been repeated in Lebanon and Iraq and other places to the point where it was starting to seem that constraining free speech would become an Arab issue, resulting in accusations against us and contempt of our culture. However, free speech has always been the most loyal friend for the people of Palestine on the regional and national level.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This statement comes as part of a wide European campaign that was kicked off by a gathering of media and Islamic European organizations asking for Johnston's release.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Awji is taking part in the campaign along with Robert Menard, the president of the organization Reporters Without Borders, Oualid Boubacar, the head of the organization the French Council for the Islamic Religion, Malik Abou Zeid, the head of the organization French People of Arab Origins, Abd Al Rahman Dahman, the head of Democratic Islamic Council in France and Mohammad Bouchari, the head of the Union of Islamic Organizations in France.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The English-Arab Organization added that the word and its defenders have been one of the strong fortresses upon which the Palestinians and the Arabs have built their hopes, by revealing what is hidden and exposing the facts.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Now, when one of the men of words is kidnapped, what high price will we have to pay when it comes to the propaganda and the press?</seg>
<seg id="9"> What tax will the national and popular struggle have to pay to settle it?</seg>
<seg id="10"> In return for this kidnapping and regardless of its motives and agenda, it is certain that the accusation will be directed at us, that we are a people that does not differentiate between those who carry pens and those who carry weapons, between those who are looking for the truth and those who are flocking to rape the nation.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It added "We call on you to release the British journalist, we call on you to preserve the respect and sanctity of the word."</seg>
<seg id="12"> "We call on you not to add new enemies to our enemies, but rather you and we should present them with the proof of the fairness of our issues. We know those who call for war and those who call for a fair peace, and it is not fair to shuffle the papers at a time when it becomes persistently clear to us who our real enemies are, and who our friends are."</seg>
<seg id="13"> "There are voices in Britain that go out in demonstrations for you. They shout in solidarity for your rights. Don't make things confusing for them, and provide an opportunity for your true enemies to gloat and create lies about your positions. Release the British journalist Alan Johnston now for the sake of Palestine, the cause and the nation."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Rise in Prices of Sardines Due to Natural and Professional Factors - Moroccan Consumer is First Victim. The Moroccan shores are experiencing an exceptional and unprecedented decrease in fish stock, which is a rare occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Official sources attributed this dangerous situation to new natural factors that affected the Moroccan waters and led to the fish migrating. In return, experienced sources in the field of sea fishing explained this phenomenon of the excessive exploitation of fish stock as due to a lack of planning regarding the surface fish. This made the stock become subject to depletion.</seg>
<seg id="4"> A number of international organizations, chiefly among them the Food and Agriculture Organization, warned against unacceptable practices such as fishing large quantities of soft sardines fit for human consumption and sending them to fishmeal factories that process them all instead of sorting out the bad quantities that are unfit for direct consumption.</seg>
<seg id="5"> These trucks coming from the domestic port were waiting in a long line in front of Al Ouyon factories before the [competent] minister stepped in and put an end to this crime by signing the national plan for surface fish, which aims to ration the exploitation of these types of fish on one hand and set the allowed quantities for fishing in each zone on the other. This is evaluated at a million tons a year in total, considering that the total stock is around eight million tons, three of which are exploitable. This comes despite the resistance that was shown by the lobbyists who control this sector and benefit from the current situation. This was behind the failure of the previous ministers in this area.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the second plan after the octopus plan that was laid out after that type of fish became threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It became necessary for the ministry, which set aside 80,000 tons for producing high-protein fishmeal as part of the national plan for surface fish, to work on making renovation of the fishmeal industry mandatory by closing the factories that do not work on renovating and modernizing their means of work and upholding ecological safety conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The message for the nation was first a warning against the depleting practices that many ships used, and also against the trucks that sent the sardines to fishmeal factories before the eyes and ears of the authorities who remained quiet and watched from the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the other side, Kamal Sabri, presidential delegate of the North Central Atlantic Fishing Chamber, said that fish traders started to gain in  importance in a local consumption market that had witnessed important developments in the past two years in terms of revenue, especially since these traders began offering better deals than the factories.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Sabri said in a special statement that the price of sardines, for example, had increased to 2.5 dirhams instead of 1.60 dirhams per kilo in the ports of the southern areas.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He added that the price of sardines in the city of Casablanca had increased due to the low stock on one hand and the great demand for the consumption of this product on the other. It had begun to cost between 19 and 20 dirhams for one kilo, depending on the quality.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Save this child, she is suffering. When poverty and sickness are combined in a family that does not possess its daily means, it creates an extremely cruel social tragedy. This is the case for the Bin Abdallah family in the city of Tlemcen in western Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The story of this family is all summarized in the daily sufferings of their daughter, Faryal, who is 18 months old. We met her mother who was holding her. Rifqah, Head of the Association for Defending the Sick, had tears that preceded her words. The mother could not believe what had happened to her innocent daughter.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She was born half paralyzed as a result of an abnormal birth, but despite that she was able to see. A few months after that, it appeared that she started to lose vision in her right eye.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After a 6-month journey between hospitals and experts, the doctors confirmed to her mother that she could be treated. Meanwhile, her eye started to get red, so she was sent to Wahran's hospital. There she was subjected to medical monitoring for one whole week. Then her eye started to get yellow, and then it transformed into a white spot on her eye. This was discovered after a medical test that she was subjected to at one of the clinics in Bouhran, where she was asked to seek treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Half paralysis, loss of vision and daily sufferings with a severe case, and as the result of another investigative trip, Faryal bin Abdallah's mother was told that the surgical operation would cost her 32 million [centimes] for one eye, or a total amount valued at 64 million centimes. And the only person who performs this kind of surgical operation is Mrs. Hartany in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Here, Mrs. Bin Abdallah stops and the cries for her daughter more each time as a result of the pain that doesn't leave the child, especially every time the sun's rays reflect on her face.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Mrs. Bin Abdallah is calling on all the charitable people or local authorities to look into her daily suffering due to the sickness of her daughter, who is no more than two years since she was born.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Daily sufferings that were augmented by the difficult social situation of the family because her father is unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> "I only wish for the return of my daughter's sight and an end to the tragedy." This is what her mother said after tears down her entire face while she begged for sympathy from whoever was interested in removing this injustice from the family and its daughter who is dying in silence.</seg>

<seg id="2"> A Moment With Summer and Children. The summer season is back and it is an appropriate time for children to have fun and play under the sun, but do you know what problems a child might face during that time?</seg>
<seg id="3"> You can become acquainted with these problems without depriving children of enjoying their vacation, as the effects resulting from the sun rays do not occur frequently but should be known and prevented.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The human body maintains its level of heat, which is around 37 degrees Celsius, in spite of all the temperatures surrounding it. This way the body guarantees the continuity of the function of the parts in a correct manner, and in return, a severe drop or rise in temperature might harm the human body and the child.</seg>
<seg id="5"> How does the human body maintain its temperature?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The body does that through balancing the production and the loss of heat. The body produces heat through chemical reactions that occur in it, and this is summarized in the word metabolism. Through the metabolism, food is transformed into energy. There is also another source of heat in the body which is the work of the muscles during the exertion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand, the body cools itself by getting rid of excess heat, and this happens mainly by radiating heat and perspiring through the skin.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Reading in the Renaissance of the Nation</seg>
<seg id="3"> The East is the cradle of civilizations and religions, but despite that, it fell into the trap of cultural backwardness. When it wanted to get up again to change this dreadful situation, it found itself at a crossroads. It does not know which road to take, as each one has its advocates who are adorning it .</seg>
<seg id="4"> As a result, a conflict occurred in the East between the pioneers of renaissance and renewal. Some of them turned their heads towards the West, taking from it all that it offers without examination or selecting what is good or bad, in the process they lose all of their cultural heritage and legacy.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Some of them turned their head towards the Islamic side, drawing from it the foundations, frameworks, principles and curricula without turning their backs on what the West has from elements of economic and political renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Two groups live on the margin of these two big trends: a group that sees Islam as a safe refuge and a strong fortress and a guide assisting in renaissance, while stressing a refusal to take any reason for the renaissance from the West.</seg>
<seg id="7"> And then there is another hesitant, confused team whose path is not clear. It does not know where to head, to the Islamic path or to the West?</seg>
<seg id="8"> The problem between the two main parties revolves around religion. The first party sees that the West advanced when it got rid of religion and the power of the Church and the domination of Popes and the clergy. So if we want to take the path of renaissance, then there is no way to do that unless we get rid of religion and its values and take the new Western values instead.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The second team was moderate, believing in the neutrality of Islam. It does not blame Islam for the present backwardness among Muslims, but aims to make Islam the basis for the new renaissance as was case in the first Islamic era, while taking into consideration the best that the West has attained as long as it does not affect belief or culture.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A sound cultural foundation should have two wings: a spiritual and moral wing, and a financial wing. The civilization that ignores the soul, values, and ethics and goes ahead with economic development until reaching whatever peak it can reach is a defective culture, and the minute it flies it will fall from a high altitude.</seg>

<seg id="2"> After Renovating Street Vendors Market, Hebron Mayor Asks Street Stall Owners to Head There - Hebron - Maan</seg>
<seg id="3"> The crews working at Hebron municipality have been renovating the market specified for street stalls, located in Bab Al Zawyeh in the city of Hebron.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The mayor of Hebron, Khaled Al Osaily, said in a statement, of which Maan received a copy: "The municipality painted the sections specified for vegetable vendors, organized the sections, and distributed them in a way that fits the nature of the work there."</seg>
<seg id="5"> The mayor said that the solution for the problem of the street stalls found randomly in the streets of the city can only come with the relocation of the vendors and stall owners to the market specified for them, which is located in a central district of the city. This creates a state of balance, and facilitates movement for sellers and shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Al Osaily added that next to this market, which was designed in an architectural and organized manner, is a parking lot for neighborhoods of the city and the surrounding villages. It also creates good economic movement for sellers and facilitates buying for shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Al Osaily asked the street stall owners to move to the market as soon as possible to achieve the public interest of the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Mayor of Hebron City : We Stopped 30 Cases of Water Theft .. and Israelis Promised Us 8,000 Cups a Day. Hebron - Maan</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Mayor of the city of Hebron, Khaled Al Osaily, revealed that the municipality staff stopped 30 cases of water theft during the past month, adding that they are +investing in the process of monitoring the loss of water in order to reduce it to the minimum amount possible, although it is much better than many Arab capitals since the percentage of the loss reached approximately 32%, whereas it is between 50 to 54% in Arab capitals.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Al Osaily, who was talking with our correspondent in Hebron, said "We will try in the upcoming months to reduce this rate of loss after improving the water network by arresting and penalizing the thieves of drinking water who use it in irrigation operations for their crops."</seg>
<seg id="5"> Al Osaily confirmed that the city does not suffer from a drinking water crisis, but it does suffer from some shortage in supply from the Palestinian water authority because of a defect in their wells that supply the south of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Al Osaily added: I follow the amount of water that we receive by reviewing the records and communicating with the water authority. The amount of water that we get daily is between 14-19 thousand cups.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Al Osaily pointed out that the city of Hebron aims to build two tanks in the areas of Jawhar mountain and Abu Rumman mountain, in addition to the existence of two points in the water line that links between Halhul and south of Hebron in cooperation with the United States Agency for Development, USAID, to feed Al Manshar tank and Al Jildah tank.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Al Osaily also pointed to his request of the Israeli side to provide Hebron with drinking water, between 7-8 thousand cups a day via the water authority, who promised him to do that.</seg>

<seg id="4"> </seg>
<seg id="5"> Urgent: Al Kazimiya Secret Prison Scandal Spreads Worldwide - The one who revealed it is a citizen of the area and it goes back to the days of Solagh at the Interior Ministry</seg>
<seg id="6"> Special: Translation An informed source told our website that the secret prison that was revealed recently in the Al Kazimiya district is being run by the extremist Badr Militia, and even the top levels at the government do not know about it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> An important source in the Iraqi government -- who refused to reveal his name - disclosed that the prison, which is located underground in Al Kazimiya, holds 415 people, all of whom are members of the Sunni community.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The date of arrest of all the prisoners goes back to the ruling period of the former Interior Minister Bayan Solagh.</seg>
<seg id="9"> According to the source, the prison used to hold more than 600 people who are Sunni Arabs, including pilots, generals, colonels and military officers who held important positions during the era of the previous regime, in addition to a number of regular citizens. The militia used to execute those prisoners and throw them in the streets to reduce their number to 415 so far.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The source said that the prison is located under a building comprised of two floors and is run by the Badr Organization. This prison was reported by a person who lives in the area, and who delivered this information to people working at humanitarian organizations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the informed source, the prison is hidden in a smart way so that anyone who passes in the street will not even notice a guard in front of the gate and that Americans might have passed by it many times.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He added that all of them get only 15-20 bottles of water a day and a simple lunch, most of which is waste.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Sources say these prisoners were kidnapped without any information registered about them at the Interior Ministry  or with the Americans.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Iraqi Journalist Reveals Names of Some Jordanian Journalists Who Received Aid from Iraqi Security Apparatuses</seg>
<seg id="3"> The famous Iraqi journalist and writer Hassan Al Alawi threatened in statements he made through the Kuwaiti satellite channel to publish lists of names of Arab writers and journalists who used to receive monthly salaries from the Iraqi intelligence service.</seg>
<seg id="4"> He said those have to return the money that they plundered from Iraq...  and he added that Iraqi writers and journalists in exile lived off European aid as political refugees while Iraq distributed millions of Iraqi dinars to Arab writers and journalists who were agents to the ruler of Iraq... He said there are tens of journalistic and satellite institutions that used to be funded by the Iraqi intelligence service.</seg>
<seg id="5"> American satellite network Fox then embarrassed Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al Muasher when it asked him about the story published by the New York Times about the discovery of lists of names of Jordanian writers and journalists who used to receive monthly salaries from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is known that Saddam Hussein built an affluent residential suburb for Jordanian journalists in one of the most affluent neighborhoods in Amman and gave them villas for free and gave the editors-in-chief and the CEOs of Jordanian newspapers S-class Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The lists that will be published soon include names like Mahmoud Al Kayed, Sultan Al Hattab, Muhammad Al Amad, Khairy Mansour and Khalil Al Sawahri who owns a publishing house funded by the Iraqi intelligence service, in addition to the publisher of the Al Hilal newspaper Ahmad Salameh and Hamada Faraana... The list will also include names of the owners of Al Dustour magazine that was issued in London and the editor-in-chief of Al Watan Al Arabi and a number of Lebanese and Egyptian journalists, on top of them Fouad Matar and Amin Iskandar. It also includes a number of Kuwaiti journalists like Ahmad Al Jarallah... the owner of Al Siyasa newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Heading the list is Lebanese journalist Nabil Al Maghrebi who issued Al Muharer newspaper in Paris following the first Gulf War.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It is said that Ahmad Salihin Al Hawni, the owner of the London-based Arab newspaper, and Abd Al Bari Atwan, the owner of the London-based Al Quds newspaper were among the names that will appear in the lists.</seg>
<seg id="10"> According to sources of the Iraqi opposition, the lists will include names of journalists and writers and the monthly salaries that used to be wired to them, the way they used to be wired and their amount. This doesn't include the financial bonuses that Iraqi magazines used to give to Arab journalists who wrote for them.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The Cross Monastery</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Cross Monastery. Barji's Palace is on the way to Hamah Missyaf, then a distance of six kilometers on the highway takes you to the Cross Monastery.  This monastery was built on a rocky hill that extends next to the modern village on a hill to the south east.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It was built from uneven stones, and ancient stones taken from the old buildings were used in it. All that is left is one building in the middle of the village known as the palace, or Barji's Palace of the Cross.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is a tower composed of two stories. Only its first floor is left while the raised wall of the second one contains four defensive windows.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The walls of the monastery were built from hewn stones that were positioned on the stone with no bases. There is also a mill for raisin molasses and [], and between the church and the ruins site is another olive mill that runs on wind.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Looking at the loss of the springs that were very rare, the monastery's residents had to collect the rain water in uncovered cisterns and tanks.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The first thing the visitor will see is a wall surrounding the monastery building, along with the cemetery, reaching a height of 80 centimeters. As for the main entrance of the church, it was subject to damage more than the other sections, so what is left of it is two big sections in the north and the south.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The central courtyard space was filled with mosaics but they were removed and only the sides are left.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The cemetery is a cube-shaped building built from large-sized stones. It includes a room inside of which are three big graves that were carved in stone. On top of each grave is a window that is wide inside and narrow outside where they buried the greatest church priests.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The mosaics of the floor of the Diaconicon represents a square painting with a decorated frame that depicts many different types of birds and small animals between the branches of the fruitful garden and the baskets sitting next to it, in addition to nine equal squares that depicted four girls inside representing the four seasons. Each one of them used to wear what represented a season, in addition to a raging bull and a wild lion and a bird with a long beak, believed to go back to the 5th century.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Another church, three kilometers east of the Monastery has three entrances and is located within a rocky area with olive orchards. In front of the door we read in Greek the year 605. Surrounding the church is the ruins of a dead city.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Jerusalem Medal for Whoever Fights Hamas or Opposes it</seg>
<seg id="3"> Jerusalem Medal for Whoever Fights Hamas or Opposes it. Written by: Muhammad Mufeed Al Khaled</seg>
<seg id="4"> We have not heard a lot about you, Jerusalem Medal, although the past seven years were filled with the work of the Mujahideen men striving for the honor which deserves the best honor they can give it.  They deserve to be honored by linking their name with Jerusalem, which they fought for with their blood and money and children. But we are in the age of wonders and the upturning of the scales.</seg>
<seg id="5"> During a short period after the events in Gaza, the Jerusalem Medal started to be bestowed on some individuals that were only linked to each other by attacking Hamas or criticizing it or opposing it. Today by criticizing Hamas for what it did in Gaza, you get this honor that is called "Jerusalem Medal" and from whom?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Directly from the president without delay or hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Whoever is giving these honors forgot two important things: first that this honor will not change the truth at all, and that this honor will not deceive our Palestinian people in any manner. The traitor will not become an honest person and the killer will not become a Mujahid. For example, Samih Al Madhoon will not be transformed from a killer to a Mujahid, and the people will not forget who attacked them and burned their houses and orphaned their children.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The second is that whoever gives the Jerusalem Medal should be protective of Jerusalem and the Al Aqsa mosque and should not sell them and waste them. For we all know, and you yourself admitted that you were among the architects of Oslo who wasted our rights and our lands and our Jerusalem. You, with your policies are still wasting our rights day after day, and performing acts of ingratitude towards Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The real honor is the honor of God, then the honor of the people and the history on the scales of truth and sacrifices. The real Jerusalem Medal was and continues to be given by the people to the Mujahideen and the heroes when they get out carrying the martyrdom on their heads, declaring their love, commitment and devotion.</seg>

<seg id="6"> My beloved, what is their sin that they have to stay stranded for five weeks at Rafah crossing without being allowed to enter Gaza ...</seg>
<seg id="7"> Where are those political agreements and the commitment to them (as they claim) ... Why are they lost between the reckonings of Fatah and Hamas regarding the Authority ... and what Authority????</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abbas is asking the Zionist entity to allow the entry of those stranded at Karam Abu Salem road ... And Hamas refuses and says this is not for their sake .... But Abbas knows that among those are people who are wanted by the Zionist entity ... And this process means returning to direct Israeli dominance on the crossings (as if this did not exist) .... You can not hide the sun with a sieve.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I wonder here why the Egyptian government does not open Rafah crossing and allow those stranded to cross instead of staying like this, unable to reach the floor or the sky .. Can't the Egyptian government do that based on the agreements signed with the angry entity?</seg>
<seg id="10"> I think it can if it wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Why do these people get lost in acts of revenge around an incomplete Authority ...

The achievements of the Egyptian government are clear and honest and I do not need to clarify them. +Yahoo, I object and condemn this report, and we should take first place among the peoples who are happy with their people. Also, 87% is not ours and is strange to us. We have a specified percentage that is known worldwide. We do not go above or below it. It is 99%. I do not know why this report brings false percentages.

<seg id="3"> In a speech by President Hosni Mubarak to celebrate the anniversary of that glorious revolution, and this expression is not mine but appeared on the screen with the speech, the President said during the speech that his regime is an extension of the July Revolution. This is not true as the revolution ended with the end of the October War.</seg>

<seg id="5"> I am not concerned here with my opinions on the Revolution and its achievements and my own position from Abd Al Nasser, this eternal leader. The intelligent question for any regular citizen is: whether this former and despicable regime that is being insulted by the regime's media day and night is the origin, and the current regime is only an extension of it as confirmed by the +head of the regime, then why would the regime stay?</seg>

<seg id="2"> Al Azhar University?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Al-Shabibah - In the last few days, Occupied Gaza witnessed successive attacks by Hamas security forces against a number of places, stores, personalities and employees. This security campaign of Hamas came against the institutions of the National Authority and its employees and against families and weddings in various places.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The most prominent attack targeted Al Azhar University, which is inclined far from the control of Hamas. It is the neighbor of the Islamic University but does not raise the green flag, and it seems that it refuses to raise the white flag. The attack was preceded by a threat to the president of the University in order to lower the Fatah flags raised in some locations at the University.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Because the request was not met, it was attacked in an unprecedented challenge, especially since the Hamas movement had previously confirmed it was not going to touch educational and academic institutions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> But since "National Salary Day," Hamas security forces have moved towards escalation and terror against anyone who is committed to the directions of the official government, and rejects "the civil government" belonging to Hamas. It has targeted some leadership personalities at official institutions. All of this is only a clear and obvious indication that the "floundering will increase as the days pass.." since the accounts of the government did not and will not match the accounts of the villagers.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Talents Suckers</seg>
<seg id="3"> The comment by the brother, owner of the crying pen, knight of the kingdom, about the stealing of his work by one of the bloggers caught my attention.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I did not believe it at first, but I stepped back and started researching the issue of intellectual property theft in Google, and I got many results that exceeded 200,000, ranging between a protection law, incidents, news and complaints.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I passed by them casually. Although I heard about many of these incidents, I did not care about them, until the brother, owner of the crying pen, showed me the reality and made me reconsider the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For more on the issue of the brother, the crying pen, please visit this URL http://fareselmamlaka.maktoobblog.com/</seg>
<seg id="7"> Theft is a grave matter that is condemned by religion and law, and even by the sane souls.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is a process that if it is beneficial today, it won't be beneficial for him on Judgment Day. The matter might be revealed one day regardless whether it takes a long or a short time. There are numerous bits of evidences of that.  I do not think that the theft issue is restricted to professionals and deviants, but it has become a fun practice for wild youth, and those looking for quick fame....</seg>
<seg id="9"> In addition to that, the matter has reached our universities and schools, even the media outlets and government departments from employees to intellectual elites some of whom have become prominent through this practice. As for trade and business, it happened shamelessly. Examples of these practices are practiced night and day, and every second there is a theft of ideas, inventions, or researches across the world. Their heroes are either men working for intelligence agencies, professional thieves, intellectual or cultural elites, or business men.</seg>
<seg id="10"> These talent suckers and the thieves of the intellectual property  are expanding their work freely despite the strictness of the law, but a conscious restraint was one of the main reasons behind the spread of these acts, especially that of fame and distinction, became one of the financial resources for the individual in a world lacking resources. Not an hour passes without a new star or a top critic or a brave journalist and a smart politician emerges before the satellite channels along with newspapers and magazines fight for them, so that they become the talk of the hour in an era when others are pressed for time.</seg>

Imagine that your soul is floating in your house and is looking at who  among your loved ones is suffering because of your loss.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Look at your mother... and her tears that have barely left her eyes ... and your wife... how she mourned you ... and your father ... how he lost you ... and look at how your children are suffering ... after you... and look ... and look... and imagine...and imagine ... the looking and the imagination grow longer ...then open your eyes and count with me how much pain and tragedy ...  have stricken those you love as a result of your death... Ah... How hard death is ... but it is our destiny.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After all of this, assume while you are watching the satellite channels and hearing that 40 unidentified bodies were found in Baghdad today and you switch to another channel to see that 50 unidentified bodies were found in several different neighborhoods in Baghdad, while a third channel minimizes today's news, describing that there were 30 unidentified bodies found today.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Now after your heard this terrible news, go back to imagining ... but imagine yourself estimating the volume of the tragedies that did not only hit those 40 or 50 or 30 -regardless of everything they suffered from pain under torture- but these tragedies and pain landed on 50 families that lost one of their parents and their supporter, leaving children that did not know the  reason why their father was killed ... Who will support them after that ... A mother that wept and wept for her husband who left a couple of hours ago from their house, hoping to return carrying with him what they need... but... you can imagine and estimate that mother who put her two children in front of her, and they were killed before they reached puberty. I'm still dreaming, while the tears stream from her eyes. Her hands barely leave their bodies.  She wipes them and kisses them, and doesn't know why they were killed ... God is for you, oh Iraq ... God is for you, O Iraq... you were killed for what fault, O Iraq ... maybe for that what I have mentioned, which one family of those 50 daily went through ... that is fed up with judicial medicine ... and fed up with our souls before that... and we don't know if a day will come that we will become like them -as long as we are described as Iraqis-??</seg>
<seg id="6"> God knows!!!!</seg>
<seg id="7"> The disappearing of the Kaabah is easier on God than killing a Muslim ... you said the truth, O prophet of God ... but our blood and our souls no longer have mercy in light of this painful situation....105 people killed in one hour in  [Tourzkhirmato] ... while 560 people were killed in Baghdad last month ... which means 560 families were afflicted with tragedy in Iraq last month ... might and power only comes from God... and for you after all this, is to go back and close your eyes while facing the kiblah in the middle of the night and pray: O God, make things easy on Iraq and its people because of what has hit them.</seg>

<seg id="3"> This was the first time that I went to a camp in my life.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After a long trip of 16 hours and a horror on the train that ended when we got to Cairo, we arrived on Friday and stayed at the International Mubarak Hotel in front of the stadium. We were put in a room of four. We were all from Alexandria. I ran to the bed that was right next to the window. Then we were introduced to the management of the camp. Then we met with men from three different provinces: Souhag, Aswan, and Bani Yousef. The day ended of course and we did not sleep. We went outside to see the city. Wow! How beautiful! We were supposed to get back at 12, but what's with that? We are from Alexandria. We got back at 3:30 am. Yes, we were scolded but it's okay. The next day, and the days that followed were routine. We woke up at 7:00 AM in the morning amidst horrible heat. It was March. It was really hot. Morning exercise at the stadium from 8:00-9:00 in the morning. Running the track, tighten your stomach, relax your legs. After this, breakfast at 9:00 AM. A bit of fava beans, some cheese and two loaves of bread and a cup of tea. At 10:00 work began. We were divided into four committees: Discipline, environment, evaluation, cultural, which was mine. We created an internal structure and I was nominated to be the editor-in-chief of the committee's magazine. I won overwhelmingly. 11 votes to 4 for Karam from Souhag. The committee made their presentations from 11 to 12 every day discussing a specific topic whether it was political, financial, or social. We were divided into four sections and got trained with a supervisor on how to discuss, research, and look up information on the topic and then present it to the guest, a doctor who specialized in his field. After lunch, from 3 to 4 the committee worked from 7-9. After that, there was a free tour in town, officially until 12, but unofficially to 2:30. Then there were discussions with guys from the provinces and amazing university doctors.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Unbelievable Syrian Effort to Exclude Terrorist Act Theory</seg>
<seg id="4"> Ahmad Muwaffaq Zeidan. One will be surprised, especially one who follows the unbelievable effort that was exerted and is being exerted by the Syrian forces to exclude the theory of a terrorist act regarding what happened in al-Musha school in Aleppo in northern Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5"> As if the poor soldiers who have no power and are in the shadow of the ethnic cancer that is spreading in beloved Syria. As if there is a big difference between their death as a result of a car bomb or as a result of negligence by the authorities who are unable to store their weapons and ammunition, in addition to being distracted by fighting the Jews.</seg>
<seg id="6"> ....</seg>
<seg id="7"> One more time, one recalls that surreal scene when the Syrian forces under the threats of the new [Goro], who is Bush, withdrew from Lebanon. One can remember that depressing surreal scene of the withdrawal of forces, with what they have of rubble and military equipment that make every Syrian and Muslim ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The tables are broken and the faces are pale, everything is deteriorating. Humans are ashamed of carrying it or getting close to it.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Of course, it is not surprising that the army is like this because inside their hearts is a faith that can make volcanoes explode, but everyone knows that what is apparent in our army is a good indication of the inside.</seg>
<seg id="10"> This sectarian system is weird. Its logic is strange and what is more strange is its [supporters] who got on the satellite channels to divide the wrong religions that exclude the theory of a terrorist act, while being silent like the silence of graves about the one who is responsible for this tragedy, and how to solve it and punish those who caused the deaths of these souls.</seg>
<seg id="11"> We all know what happened to those who caused Zayzoun dam and before that, the handing over of Golan and Qunaitra and the massacres that spread across time and space. Suleiman, his father, his grandfather, and his grandson will congratulate you on the tragedies, disasters, and [deterioration].</seg>

<seg id="2"> Tahila: Building Shops for Street Vendors</seg>
<seg id="3"> Among the proposed projects put forward by the local committee of the National Initiative for Human Development in Tahila, Taza region on Monday July 23, 2006, was one to launch the work on projects sponsored by the National Initiative Fund for Human Development in the city of Tahila.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Among the projects focused on was the project of building commercial shops to benefit street vendors.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Here is the technical card for the project: Location: city center, the municipal market</seg>
<seg id="6"> Targeted category: street vendors in Tahila</seg>
<seg id="7"> The project's components: 45 commercial shops, security center, toilets for men and women</seg>
<seg id="8"> The covered area: 323 square meters</seg>
<seg id="9"> Source of investment: National Initiative Fund for Human Development (400,000 Dirhams), provincial budget (600,000 Dirhams), the urban community of Tahila (the land)</seg>
<seg id="10"> The expected time to finish the project is four months</seg>
<seg id="11"> Sadeek company in Tamara won the bid.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The unit's expense costs 22,200 Dirhams for each commercial shop.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The tracking processes will be supervised by the general labor [union].</seg>
<seg id="14"> The inauguration ceremony was attended by the head of the municipal council, some members and representative of the local committee for human development, members of the team to reenergize the Jerusalem neighborhood, and heads of departments.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Some of the citizens were surprised because some representatives showed up in spite of problems known to be present in dealing with the local matter in Tahila.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The proposed question remains, how will these commercial shops be divided?</seg>
<seg id="17"> What are the criteria?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Last, what are the chances for the success of this project that was mapped out in the absence of those concerned with the matter?</seg>
<seg id="19"> The condition for the success of a commercial project depends on choosing the right location.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Is the vacant area behind the municipal market good?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Does the municipal market have enough publicity and turnout that it might contribute to the publicity of the commercial shops for the street vendors?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Hasn't one investor previously used two places in the same area to sell fish, then abandoned his project?</seg>
<seg id="23"> Finally, who will visit shops located near the biggest disposal area for garbage in the middle of the city?</seg>
<seg id="24"> The citizens of Tahila city think hard before they have to go to the municipal market because of the bad odor and the swarms of flies surrounding the market. Has the municipal council in Tahila thought about the hygiene situation for these shops or is it going to make things worse?</seg>
<seg id="25"> What is the role of the health department in Tahila municipality?</seg>

<seg id="4"> An invitation for a serious discussion. Welcome to all of you. Here is a question I would like to ask, why?</seg>
<seg id="5"> The reasons are many and the answers vary. Everyone has his own view.. but at the end we should have a convincing answer that will be selected over the other answers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> My question is: "Why is what is prohibited always desired?"</seg>
<seg id="7"> </seg>
<seg id="8"> The child will only play with what is prohibited. In the garden he only goes to what is prohibited, and only eats what's prohibited of candy and chips.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The only concern of the girl and the boy during their adolescent years is to break the barriers of what's prohibited so that they can do it regardless of results and consequences.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A girl who is prohibited to go online, will go online not caring about being scolded and log on the chat room to talk with whoever.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A guy who is all the time harassing and hitting on girls in the markets and hangs out with a bad company not caring about any blame that might come as a result of that.</seg>
<seg id="12"> We find ourselves chasing any product that is prohibited from the market, and we pay double for it to get it.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Why is everything that is prohibited, desired?</seg>

<seg id="2"> A Vision.  My sister came to tell me about a dream she saw in her sleep. She said: I saw you preparing to travel to an Arab country, a group of friends and I.  You were among an academic delegation. You were preparing to travel quickly. You were with one of the girls, who seemed closer to you than the rest. You were happy and excited because you would be traveling. It ended== Now I know.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Travel= New life; and I'm about to start a new life. What good news!</seg>
<seg id="4"> That is about to become true. As for the girl that seemed to be closer to me than the others, while on the phone with one of my girl friends, I discovered that she works at the same place where I applied to get a small job in this area.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I felt this place fits her really well but when I talked to her.. She expressed her distress and boredom of the place. I know it too.  I have met a number of officials there though she doesn't know that I'm following a religious policy that was recommended by the Prophet (Do your own things silently) and this is what I did. When it becomes official and I get selected, then I will tell her everything----:)</seg>

<seg id="2"> Financial Protection Court...!!</seg>
<seg id="3"> Towards Creating a Financial Protection Court, with Total Neutrality and Independence</seg>
<seg id="4"> Here they are, our esteemed deputies who just finished the second session of the 11th legislative chapter... after rounds and campaigns of mostly intense political discussions, while smooth in some instances, that ended thank God with an endorsement of the general state budget for the coming financial year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I was really hoping for the adoption of the financial protection law because it is one of the strongest and most important tools to combat corruption in Kuwait. This will be no doubt a reason to establish the principle of integrity and transparency, to prevent deviations and managerial and executive overstepping in all sectors of the state, wherever they are.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This law will be like the boundary between clean and honorable trust and despicable manipulation and managerial corruption.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Illegal gain is a despicable trait in any society. It usually sticks fast to its perpetrator. It seeps into him to become an inseparable part of him. It helps to create very bad class and social differences... which might result in punishment that is not taken lightly among the community, not to mention considering stealing state money and its fortunes a legitimate right for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is really unfortunate and shameful at the same time that discussing and adopting this law will be postponed with the excuse that the agenda of the parliament is busy with interrogations and other things in the parliament's schedule.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I hope we do not wait long to see the ratification of the financial protection law during the next session, God willing, during the first of its session, next October.. that is, before the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Finally, we have to see with total logic... that the party executing this law is a neutral party, fully and wholly independent from the government... similar to the accounting court that has a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I wish it will be called (The Financial protection court) so as to be an important pillar in our free democratic society and an important cultural pillar for integrity and transparency in the country of Kuwait.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Although the residents of the western areas do not depend on plumbing for drinking or cooking, but substitute it with filtered water, I say: Imagine that what happened in the area of Bani Hassan would happen, God forbid, in one of the affluent areas of west Amman like Deir Al Ghbar. This is a very far-fetched possibility, as far as if the distance between the two places were multiplied by an astronomical number. Will the reaction be the same as it was initially?</seg>
<seg id="4"> Of course the picture will be different concerning the reaction in terms of speed and solving the problem. The intestines of delicate people will not tolerate the simplest type of microbes that infiltrate the water despite the safety procedures in the water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Of course with the pumping speed of the air filter to the water, a heavy scapegoat will be presented to the public with the aim of absorbing the anger. In addition to that, private hospitals will roll out the red carpet for its frequent patients because the medical bills will be costly.  The municipality will start digging holes in the streets continuously, for the purpose of improving the network of this street. Digital ministers will flock to this area because they are simply among its, residents or the neighboring areas residents.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Poor you, you the area of Bani Hassan village. If you had a working minister or a high-ranking official then the reaction would have been bigger than what happened.</seg>

<seg id="1"> They Are Destroying Trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> They are destroying the trees on the main highway that cuts the city of Najran into two halves. We found that the area's municipality had cut down ornamental trees.</seg>
<seg id="3"> They did not cut down the whole tree. They left the trunk and some of the branches and got rid of its greenness and its shadow that had been present for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The view became really ugly as if it were autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I do not think there is an obvious reason for this behavior because I found the cut trees scattered in the middle of the road until they dried out.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even if there was a justification for doing that, what's the point of leaving the trees in this state?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Do they think that they will go back to what they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="8"> .</seg>
<seg id="9"> I do not know much about planting ornamental trees. Is it possible that they will go back to what they were if their edges were cut?</seg>
<seg id="10"> But the road lacks the general view of the nice green color, and for some the coolness that these trees brought to the road, especially in the hot, summer season.</seg>
<seg id="11"> What are they going to add?</seg>
<seg id="12"> I do not know.. All I know is that they are destroying the trees.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Another point is that both the citizen and the visitor to the area see, when they are in bad shape, especially after the latest project in which the road was dug more than once, is that they are paving the same road.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The road is dug once or twice, even three times, never being restored to how it used to be.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The road really became like the glass that you can never fix after you break it.</seg>
<seg id="16"> People complain daily about this road to the degree that the municipality ignores or makes it a point to ignore it more than once.</seg>
<seg id="17"> I saw some machines, a few days ago working on filling some of the holes in the road, as some sort of a hint that fixing and paving the road will only happen in the far future-- if it ever happens.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Woman, Between Serving the House and Man's Command</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Woman, Between Serving the House and Man's Command</seg>
<seg id="3"> Eastern societies differ in their customs and traditions from western societies.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Maybe one of the strongest reasons for the backwardness of eastern societies is that they adhere to most of the customs that are not related to either religion or ethics.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Among these common customs until this day, is the erroneous concept regarding woman.. that she must be a maid in the house starting from cooking and preparing the food, to cleaning the house, washing the dishes and clothes, and then ironing them .... This is the reality in most Middle and Near East countries ... The man doesn't know how to cook, clean the house, wash the clothes, or any other housework. He considers it a woman's job, whether she was a mother, a sister, a wife, or a girl.</seg>
<seg id="6"> So regardless of her job outside the house, meaning if she was an employee or a worker or one of those with top certificates, the woman must be a good housewife ...  Thus, we find the female employee doing housework when she returns from her job and usually prepares the meals for the next day at night  ... As for vacation days, they are the employee's chance to complete what was piled up from the housework during the working week.... If we make a calculation and calculated the working hours of the woman outside the house and added the hours of the housework, we will find that the poor woman does not enjoy one vacation day, not even once a year.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This is for the woman working outside the house, but as for the housewife, meaning the one without a job, she also has the misfortune of not enjoying a vacation at all, as she starts working from the time she wakes up to the time she sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="8"> But the man enjoys being exempted from the house work, and all he has to do is work outside the house... and if he comes to the house then his orders should be final, and all his requests should be met. If only he would be content and satisfied. Instead you find him always complaining, he doesn't like the food and the clothes are not washed well, along with other false pretexts as if he is dealing with his maid.</seg>
<seg id="9"> So what is the reason behind this common phenomena in most of the Eastern societies ... Is it a religious inheritance? Or a social or legal tradition?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Was it the man who forced the woman to do this thing? Or was it the woman who empowered the man and made him the master?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As for religion, and according to what is legal and standard to the public and the private, the responsibility of house management falls on the man ... either he does this himself or he hires a servant.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Religion didn't force housework on the woman, for even if the woman had a baby, the father must provide the baby a breast feeder. And if the mother breast feeds the child, then he must get her permission, or she can ask to get paid for breast feeding. The same goes for the babysitter.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The situation doesn't go beyond it being the creation of customs and traditions ... Probably, what helped in spreading it and generalizing it is poverty... During most of the ages that humans went through, and even in this age, for some reason the husband can not come up with a salary for a maid because he can hardly provide food, and since the woman was most of the time unemployed, she supported the man by cooperating with him while he works to provide a living while she works in the house. That was a good move by the woman in order to help out with the man ... but this help was taken advantage of by the man and with the passage of generations, this became a social law</seg>
<seg id="14"> The issue was not restricted to the needy only, but it reached the wealthy also.  Man began to feel that it is his right that the woman serves him and provides him with his household requests. Can the woman after she gave up to the man and accepted this capable of getting rid of this dilemma now? And does the man realize that he has treated the woman unfairly?</seg>
<seg id="15"> This depends on the woman herself, because first, she has to ask to be equal with the man, and second the man must be aware of this issue and feel truly that the woman is completely equal to him...  Inasmuch as we are calling for complete equality between the woman and the man, we also are calling on the man to share life's responsibility with the woman inside and outside the house, as is the case in most western countries. This way the man will not be the master of the house or the woman the Mrs., but both of them will be partners in everything.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Institutional Work</seg>
<seg id="3"> There are a number of effective leaderships that create a lot of innovation in the practical, professional, technical, and political fields.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Rules are set, theories are looked at, and future visions are drawn.. according to viable and studied plans.. These programs and plans consume a lot of time, great effort, and a lot of money.. then comes the mechanism of executing these projects, plans, ideas, suggestions, and theories on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="5"> A great effort, trouble, and large amounts of money were spent. They are implemented on the ground for a period that might be extended or shortened... Then one day, we will be surprised ... if these ideas and plans disappeared, and the suggestion was removed, or the activity disappeared.. That's when we start to look for reasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The removal of these programs, or plans, or projects reveals that the leaders that adopted this idea disappeared for one reason or another.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Examples of this, is the idea of the activity that was extinguished with the departure of the honorable Dr Mohammad Al-Rashid. The idea of model schools disappeared with the departure of some of the supervisors in the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The idea of education resources, on which the ministry spent millions of Riyals, until now, has not achieved the best and [the parallel] thing.  Money was spent on it from expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Likewise, the idea of the electronic government, which was adopted by Prince Muqrin bin Abd Al-Aziz who was concerned about activating it, conducted many press conferences and other managerial meetings with the heads of all the civil and military departments about this topic.  Businessmen participated in these meetings too.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In the area of Medina, despite the departure of Prince Muqrin, the idea did not disappear but the interest in it is not as it used to be.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Among the new ideas also is the idea of the new post, which carries the slogan (An address without turning and circling) that the national corporation adopted for the post and initiated in a number of neighborhoods in Medina. The distribution of these boxes has started.  They were placed on houses within 60% of the neighborhoods of Medina.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I think this idea has not be studied enough. A number of writers wrote about it in the local press with the view that it is better if the residential areas are surveyed first then numbered, then the postal service will be extended to whoever wishes.. As for what happened, it is a clear wasting of the institution's money.. as most of the boxes that were put on houses were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In all cases, we need organized and disciplined work.. this organized work establishes the future course for all the programs, projects, systems, and decisions.. Afterwards, the good ones are adopted.. after an intensive study by experts.</seg>
<seg id="14"> With this organized work, a program or a project will not be affected by the departure of someone or the arrival of another.. because work is being done according to a specific mechanism, and very clear regulations and strategies.</seg>

<seg id="3"> One needs some effort to improve his performance but severe exhaustion might lead to many negative results.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Exhaustion is a state of fatigue as a result of a physical or mental fatigue or illness.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Fatigue and exhaustion are among the dangerous things that can lead to the destruction of civilizations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A human is not supposed to get tired and exert an extreme effort in his work without resting.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Resting after work is as important as food.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Fatigue makes the human unable to endure and circumstances will overwhelm him so that everything in front of him becomes a giant while the human becomes a midget before it.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Fatigue is the main entrance to a physical illness.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Fatigue and exhaustion lead to an increase of hormones in the blood stream and among those hormones is adrenaline that leads to increase in blood pressure, and also hormones that stop the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="11"> This fatigue might be also related to other illnesses like stomach and intestinal illnesses, the flu, herpes, and some types of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The signs of exhaustion are an increase in heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, tension of the nerves, mental slowness, and a lack of focus.</seg>
<seg id="13"> To reduce exhaustion, it is recommended to eat sweet items for breakfast and reduce the laxatives that cause the loss of Vitamins A-D that might result in exhaustion and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="8"> My lips moved upwards, and then the incisors and molars started to appear on the stage of the session. Innocent laughs were heard. They announced while mixing with the waves, the success of my deal with them, although I'm the only winner.</seg>
<seg id="9"> A question came to my mind with which I like to end my meeting with the waves. Do you try to bring happiness to everyone who suffers like you did with me?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Although there is no benefit to you at all from it.. I wish my poem was not to humans like a sea of tenderness, taking me in its arms, embracing me like you did now... I stopped.. A goodbye look. I ended the meeting with the sea and I left.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The waves try to follow me, they are calling me with their songs, but I preferred to leave. Unfortunately, many are being made  as I was made previously. As soon as the need ends, the individual retreats and he forgets or tries to forget.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Now I know why the human is not like the waves of the beaches. My deed replied to my question, so the summary became the title of my article.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Current Situation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The current situation, the current situation. I can no longer begin reading a book on literary criticism, fiction or poetry without worrying about falling into a whirlpool of hallucinations and distractions.  Meaning sliding and ignorance, meaning stupidity, not to mention the philosophies of the mentally retarded, meaning stupid intellectuals.</seg>
<seg id="3"> While I'm reading about the current situation and my situation, I started to be scared of getting into a dialogue with anyone, because I'm scared of the barricades of ideas that the negotiators hide behind. I also fear those unique cases of ignorance that is becoming sacred and can't be touched, meaning that ignorance became prestigious and a façade.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I can no longer visit any art exhibition because I'm scared to get injured in the eye from the dullness of the works that run after a stupid viewer, who claps with his eyes in astonishment, whose opinion is the same in everything.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Meaning, he knows everything.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I fear those twisted methods, meaning those exposed to stealing artistic works.  It is because of the intense move towards a buyer who savors oil, applies gas perfume, and dreams of gases.</seg>
<seg id="7"> What scares me more are those beautiful forms coming from nature (whether it was wood or stone) whose dust one cleans from it just to add on it the dirtiness of one's name, so that it will be in the opinion of the complainers, meaning the critics, a very creative work that should be added to the saturated, meaning bloated, cultural memory from mold or the lying feed that tops the algae of moist thought.</seg>
<seg id="8"> I'm still scared of writing, fearing a reader who for him the meaning of the written word is what he understands, and not the meaning that is intended. I still write a question that whispers shouting: To what reality are we walking in unison, as if we closed all the directions, and [succumbed] to silence?</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An Attempt to Invade the Mentality of Western Youth and a Look into the Reasons for Scientific Superiority. 2 The Culture of Beauty and Creativity</seg>
<seg id="3"> Perhaps some of you will not agree with me on this point, but I view it as fundamental in finding a type of pursuit for superiority that is related to perfection in the western mentality. This culture is represented in caring about appearances and aesthetic touches in everything.  They don't rely only on innovating something without an aesthetic touch.</seg>
<seg id="4"> When you grow up in a beautiful country and a beautiful house, you see beauty and cleanness everywhere, this will reflect on the quality of your productivity, and I will not be exaggerating if I say even on the quantity of the productivity, in addition to creating a type of love for creativity generated by this culture, a society that doesn't have mercy on the loser.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is difficult to find covered-up unemployment or favoritism in the west, since this motive makes it mandatory for every person to improve his productivity and gain new skills that will grant him the ability to work to gain money, and to enjoy life, which as I mentioned above, you can only enjoy with money that only comes with gaining skills and serious, hard work.</seg>
<seg id="6"> That's why we find tireless attempts by workers to get promoted in their jobs, and this doesn't occur randomly, but occurs after offering something to your job. If you know that neither your creativity nor increasing your productivity will benefit you, you will become depressed and abandon the whole idea.  You will leave the promotion to those favored ones who once they get promoted to a position that they don't deserve, become a destructive device in their work place, and God knows the lack of social problems.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Of course, the social problems that surround any human, restricts his imagination and creativity, and also his basic abilities to work properly. One will say that western society is filled with the problems of divorce, disintegration, and emotional breakdowns. I would say that this is true but it doesn't make the problem bigger and doesn't follow him all of his life, as it happens among us, where looks will follow you, and gossip about you will not end, if you had problems.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The nature of family bounding here increases your pressures while the carelessness of their societies removes from you the weight of the problems, which keeps you on a good productive track, or will have a minor effect that will soon disappear. God only knows, to be continued, God willing.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Kill Our Children By Hunger</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Sami Al Akhras. The lion extended his dominance and power, and showed his force and planted his paws in the heart of the nation. He ate everyone to make himself the king of a barren forest that does not have water or food in it, a forest that will only be saved from desertification by crowded refugee camps. The fate led them to carry their tents to the deserts of Gaza, and it will become crowded with the human warehouses that were built by the International Relief Agency.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Inside the forest, the triumphant lion sits and is confused, asking himself what will he do with these mouths and these wounded animals that are looking for food and something to silence the cries of their hungry children.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The wounded lion stalks and roars whenever he gets the chance to express his existence, and that he is still there, standing firmly on his feet.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Between the triumphant lion of Gaza, and the wounded lion of the West Bank, the mill turns and grinds everyone. The decisions and resolutions came from both. Both are looking for their legitimacy which is being violated daily by the occupation through its planes and tanks, a legitimacy that was built on the corpses and blood of a whole people, and an issue that stands before the storms of death and uprooting.</seg>
<seg id="6"> During this [issue] of legitimacy, the Prime Minister charged with leading the emergency government, Salam Fayyad, who is considered one of the economic figures who deal with situations based on a specific economic viewpoint, addressed through it the feelings of the hungry as they are a victim of hunger and poverty. Their only source to feed their children is their salaries that are subject to deterioration during the previous period, the period of democracy and two-headed legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Let us go back to the origin of this story and the beginning of this tale. We all confess and stress and confirm that the employment processes depended on the certificate of qualification that you got from the party in addition to the color of your party flag. The academic certificate is a certificate that is no longer valid and does not guarantee qualification. This is because of our universities that nowadays do not give an educational degree without writing in the party affiliation. This is an unforgivable mistake, since it bypassed this article in the certificate and did not realize that it is more important than the article that states the grade of the graduating student.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Prime Minister Salam Fayyad issued a decision to end the employment contracts that were set during the past two years. This decision did not specify the reason behind its release. Was it a slap at the dismissed government? Or is it part of a process of comprehensive reform for the employment situation?</seg>
<seg id="9"> It was issued as a slap at the dismissed government. This slap fell hard on the faces of the employees' children because the dismissed prime minister and the ministers and the government employees and the members of the departments and the members of the executive branch, and all the government and party entourage have guaranteed their salaries through bonuses and incentives and luxuries, in addition to the cost of transport and the cost of risk and the cost of missions and the cost of leadership and the cost of the mental and social and health insurance and the cost of clothes and the cost of heavy meals that contain energy and proteins. I guarantee that they will not be influenced and will sleep quiet nights, warm and reassured.</seg>
<seg id="10"> If this was an employment reform, then here all the question and exclamation marks beside it, and the other punctuations will not be enough to ask, what reform?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Is reform a punishment for the employees for belonging to their parents or punishment for the children because they are the children of the contracts' employees?</seg>
<seg id="12"> I'm sorry, Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, take your battle away from the cries of the hungry child and the oppressed father. You have to reconsider this dangerous decision, so don't kill our children in the name of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Have mercy on our people ... and have mercy on your people ...  spare our future children from death and hunger and envy .... Those who you want to punish, a smell of barbecue is coming out of their kitchen. Rising to the tunes of the waves of the sea is the smell of good food ... As for those who are starving, they are the children of these employees ....... Have mercy on us on earth, so that you will have mercy in heaven.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In A Natural Reaction, Ministry of Interior Starts to Define Authority's Jurisdiction!!</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> I have nothing against the subsuming of the Authority for Enjoining Good and Preventing Evil under the banner of the Ministry of Interior and letting it specialize solely in enjoining good and preventing evil without any further jurisdiction, provided that every single one of its members becomes highly trained in dealing with people and in methods of enjoining them to do good and preventing them from perpetrating evil.</seg>
<seg id="3"> They should be given basic military training, and a unified uniform similar to the Army's uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Anyone who has a criminal record and was previously employed by the Authority should be removed, as should anyone who has more than one job.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There is no objection to increasing their wages, since their jobs are important and they are full-time employed in a single job. The work of the Authority becomes acceptable under these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> What made me say this is the secret memo sent recently by the Ministry of Interior to all the emirs of the regions and other relevant bodies, and circulated by forums on the Internet, including Al-Saha.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In essence it prohibits arresting anyone, no matter who, in the Authority's centers, and handing them over immediately to the police or other relevant security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It also prohibits questioning people or obtaining confessions from them by any means whatsoever, and whoever in the Authority breaches this shall be immediately suspended.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this way, the Authority becomes another police but with no jurisdiction, its duty to merely arrest the offender. It would be better for it to give up on this role and devote itself to calling to Allah in a gentle way, after its most important jurisdiction that it fought for has been wrested away. Maybe then people will accept it as a missionary body, like any other.. yes?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Maybe those from whom the Authority used to take undertakings then release them will be prejudiced, but that was an error the Authority fell in because it was based from the start on stalking people's faults. However, anyone in breach should be punished unequivocally just as if it was the police or the investigators arresting them.</seg>
<seg id="11"> To read the memo, please visit the article by brother Angry North on this link http://alsaha.fares.net/sahat?128@152.zyg4gMIOErF.0@.3baa3958</seg>

<seg id="1"> Photos of Naked Dressed Saudi Women While Aramco Administration Plays Games With Our Money In the US (photos)</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Following the generous donation of nearly 25 million dollars by Saudi ARAMCO through its offices in Texas in the United States of America, made for the construction of homes for some of Louisiana's victims of Hurricane Katrina, at a time when some of the Saudi people have sunk below the poverty line while the rest are burdened with debt.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It had previously donated five million dollars in cash for the same reason.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Saudi Aramco also celebrates Texas National Day on February 22 of every Christian year, costing it thousands of dollars annually.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I have no idea why Texas National Day is our business, may all their days be gloomy???</seg>
<seg id="6"> Why does Aramco donate five million dollars in cash to US victims of Hurricane Katrina???</seg>
<seg id="7"> Why does Aramco donate 25 million dollars for the construction of homes for victims of Hurricane Katrina???</seg>
<seg id="8"> Why does Aramco donate 8,000 dollars to a Texan TV station?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Why does Aramco sponsor a marathon race in Texas, attended by contestants from all over the world, and I haven't ever heard it sponsoring even a sheep race in the Kingdom?</seg>
<seg id="10"> I wish I and others could find answers to these questions from Saudi Aramco officials not the US ones!!!!!!!!!! The dirty American people work for us as employees and get paid more than their, plus their father's and their grandfather's wage in the US, and are treated with more respect and honor than the locals in the company. He is not opposed in any error he commits, i.e. he is above the law. He gets wages so humongous that if his monthly wage was divided among seven poor Saudi families it would last them a year. He is not proficient in his work, but he is blonde and blue eyed. He neither prays nor fasts, and his wife attends any reception held by the officials who sign the donation checks for the poor Americans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</seg>
<seg id="11"> Aramco strives to westernize Saudi women and their domain. They show Saudi women unveiled, and the anti-veil phenomenon has started stealthily, while the open game is played by placing women in jobs that impose gender co-mingling, or as secretaries to debauched directors!!!!!!!!</seg>
<seg id="12"> Its former policies have changed. It used to respect the people, and now it despises them; it used to protect the Islamic legal system and now it breaches it. And while it used to build us schools with our money, it has now ceased to do so and is building for the Americans and helping the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Aramco has an office for supporting charities in the area. 99% of the donations go to Al-Awamiya, Al-Qatif, and to disabled Shia and Shia with special needs, although Sunna schools for those with special needs are twice the number of those for the Shia!!!!! The health program in Sihat, and societies in Al-Qadeeh and sports activities for the Shia and all that was designated for the society is departing from Aramco, bypassing Khubar and Dammam to reach Al-Qatif and is solely for the Shia. Are there any answers from those in charge of the activities????????</seg>
<seg id="14"> Or is it an acknowledgement that the petrol is theirs and we are a liability as they repeatedly say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</seg>
<seg id="15"> I'll now leave you to look at the photos taken on the Texas National Day last month. They have been disseminated among Aramco staff and all who saw them were annoyed with the company as they know many poor people who need financial support and who are more important than the Christian Americans who pay taxes so that their state can humiliate Muslims and subdue them and kill them  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</seg>
<seg id="16"> Happy Birthday Texas, Happy Birthday Texas, Happy Birthday Texas, we are all your slaves.......................</seg>

<seg id="1"> Bush Behind September 11 Attacks, Says French Minister</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The www.ReOpen911.info website on the Internet stated that a high ranking French personality currently occupying a ministerial position in Nicolas Sarkozy's cabinet hinted last year that the US President George Bush might be behind the attacks of September 11, 2001.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The website, which propagates conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks, published a video of the French Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Christine Boutin in which she seems to question that Al-Qaeda Organization led by Osama bin Laden had engineered the attacks. Boutin's office have tried to minimize the importance of such comments.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In an interview last November, before becoming a Minister, she was asked if she believed Bush might be behind the attacks. Boutin replied "I think that is possible. I think that is possible."</seg>
<seg id="5"> Boutin supports this opinion by mentioning the huge number of people who visit websites critical of the official line on the September 11 attacks on the US cities.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "I know that the sites that speak of this problem are the sites that have the greatest numbers of visits, so, I tell myself ... that this expression of the mass of the people cannot be without any truth."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Boutin's office tried to minimize the importance of her comments, stating that later in the interview she said "I'm not telling you that I adhere to that position". This comment does not appear on the video published by the website.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A number of website on the Internet have also published the video in recent days and the story has started to infiltrate the main media.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In a headline, the French Le Monde said "Christine Boutin Falls Into the Trap of Her Controversial September 11 Remarks".</seg>
<seg id="10"> Will the minister's opinion change after she has become an official in Sarkozy's cabinet? Officials are accountable for what they say, and their utterances are not considered just casual talk.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Paucity of Gulf Tourists in Syria Affects the Incomes of Unit Owners and Cab Drivers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Paucity of Gulf tourists in Syria is affecting the incomes of unit owners, cab drivers and retailers... Damascus (Sabaq) from A'aid Al-Ghamadi: There are problems faced by many travelers to Syria who are subjected to theft, fraud and deception by gangs whose main task is to fish for these people of various nationalities, stalk them and harm them. In some cases it got as far as murder and armed robbery. Most of the incidents focused on Gulf states nationals,  making them victims of harm.</seg>
<seg id="3"> These repeated incidents in the past period made many, and especially Gulf residents, desist from spending this year's summer holiday in Syria as they used to in the past years, and to change their destination to other countries where they and their property would be safe, as they want to enjoy their summer holiday.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Some Saudi papers published a number of unjustified arrests, as well as cases of murder in units and so on.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Sabaq made a tour in the Syrian capital Damascus where we met a number of traders whose occupations are directly related to tourists and visitors to Syria and whose activities' vitality and income, during the summer, are directly affected by tourists, and for whom summer is a hot season. These are cab drivers, rental properties office owners, hair dressers, retailers and shop owners. All agreed that this summer was very quiet, particularly in terms of Arab Gulf residents. One of the cab drivers that we took a trip with told us, "You are the first Gulf resident to get into the cab in a month," pointing out that in past years he would work all day long throughout the summer as most of his passengers were from the Gulf, and that his income was affected this year because of the lack of interest from Gulf tourists in coming to the country this year.</seg>
<seg id="6"> An owner of a retail shop confirmed the same thing saying, "Our sales levels have dropped because there is a paucity of Gulf tourist shoppers, who used to come in large numbers and embark on buying various goods when they came to Syria that they took with them back home on returning."</seg>
<seg id="7"> A number of real estate office owners said that while summer was the hot season for renting out units and it was hard to get a furnished unit a week into the start of the season, this year most of the furnished units are still vacant and are being offered very cheaply to the very few renters.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A real estate office owner added, "In past years, it was the office owner who used to choose units for clients and prices were highly profitable. This year, the client chooses the suitable unit and prices it as suits him, while offices compete for his business because of the paucity of tourists coming to Syria this year, and especially from the Gulf states.</seg>

<seg id="2"> England honors Marcel Khalife and the Beatles?</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Lebanese artist Marcel Khalife participated on July 14 in Liverpool in a concert held by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the city of the Beatles and John Lennon, whose name marks the city's airport.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The concert was held at the Philharmonic Hall at the close of the five-day long Annual Liverpool Arabic Arts Festival that hosts annually one of the well-known Arab artists. This year it celebrated Khalife.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He also presented another concert at the St. George Hall in Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="6"> During both concerts, Khalife played the oud and performed vocal pieces, accompanied by his sons - Rami on the piano and Bachar on percussion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Philharmonic Arab Night was made of two parts. First was a piano concerto composed by the Lebanese Abdalla El Masri and then an Andalusian suite for oud and orchestra by Marcel Khalife interspaced with the pieces "Zaghareed", "Granada", "Your Swaying Figure" and "Alexandria Girls".</seg>
<seg id="8"> The orchestra was conducted by Maestro Clark Rundell, and the two concerts were attended by over 3000 people who came to listen to this new music in Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Khalife said that the Mayor of Liverpool Paul Clark received him on this occasion and said in his welcoming address that he was one of the contemporary music composers whose music expresses humanism in its transparency and expansiveness, and that his participation in Liverpool with the Philharmonic Orchestra left us deeply and very impressed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Lebanese artists is completing his summer tour around Europe and the Arab World, and is expected to participate in a concert with the Omani Symphonic Orchestra in Muscat on July 30, together with the famous Indian violinist Subramaniam.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Khalifa will also participate in the Young Euro Classic Festival in Berlin on August 10, conducted by the maestro Simon Wright, and on the 25th with the Absolute Ensemble conducted by the American Kristjan Jarvi in a concert held at the Kennedy Center in New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Speaking about these tours and his participation, Khalife said, "I travel east and west in my work with these international orchestras out of love, so that these works create an echo, a story through which I express my questioning and convictions. Frankly, I reflect through them myself, my support of my country, without being appointed by anyone."</seg>
<seg id="13"> "I represent my country in my own way," added Khalife. "Maybe I represent the democratic, secular Lebanon through my music, one removed from sectarianism, nepotism and contingencies.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Recently, Khalife presented his works as part of the Spring Festival in Nancy in northern France with the L'Orchestre Symphonique Gradus  conducted by Francois Legee, and with the Italian Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Carl Martin in Milano prior to that.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Carthage Festival Partial To Its Own This Year?</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Carthage Amphitheatre was built in early second century and saw many modifications in the third and fourth centuries before being destroyed in 439 by the Vandals. The circumference of the amphitheatre is about 106 meters in diameter and is based on the side of the Odeon hill, and is about 50 meters long. Its backdrop was decorated with huge statues and the whole of the edifice covered in white marble and limestone.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It used to accommodate over 11,000 viewers, but a large part of it was destroyed and then slowly covered in rubble.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It was unearthed in 1904 by the researcher Gauckler.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It was restored in 1967 to become the venue of the Carthage International Festival, one of the most prominent summer events on the Tunisian cultural scene. It has reached its 43rd session which will start tomorrow, Saturday, and continue to August 16, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This year's season will see an intense participation by Tunisian performances, particularly after the issuance of decisions stating some 60 percent of the events in the various festivals must be Tunisian.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The most prominent Tunisian contributions will have the signatures of  Saber Al-Ribee, Soufia Sadok and Latifa Arfoui, and seem to be performances that have been postponed from  last season.</seg>
<seg id="9"> As for other performances, there is the concert by the Moroccan artist Gad El Maleh on July 31.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Part of the Arab performances was programmed by the Festival in agreement with Rotana, as has been usual in the past three years, despite this trend being strongly opposed, especially by the local media, because of the now routine and expected chaos, as names get announced, only for the list to change in the last moment or even a little after that.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Festival, which is directed this year by Mr. Mohammed Raga Farahat, will produce the opening and closing ceremonies - a custom followed by the Festival for years.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The opening ceremony will be devoted in presenting samples of contemporary interpretation of folk musical and literary heritage.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The closing ceremony will be devoted to honoring an elite of prominent composers in Tunisian music, many of whom have recently passed away, such as the great musicians Ali Sariti and the late Abdel Hamid Balaljiah and others, to mention a few.</seg>
<seg id="14"> It should be mentioned that Tunisia is celebrating this year the 50th anniversary of the republic. The Carthage Festival concert of July 25 will be in tune with the occasion and present many patriotic songs, performed by a group of famous Tunisian singers, including Lotfi Bouchnak, Sonia M'barek, Shukri Bouzian, Soufia Sadok, Leila Hejaiej, Dirsaf Al Hamadani and Rihab Al Sagir..</seg>
<seg id="15"> The work team of this concert will be directed by the composer Hammadi ben Othman</seg>
<seg id="16"> The orchestra will be conducted by maestro Ahmed Achour, head of the Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, and will be flavored with a number of eastern musical instruments and a coterie of the best musicians in Tunisia.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Weddings in Guelma Between Following Fashion and Jumping Over Traditions</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Weddings in Guelma Between Following Fashion and Jumping Over Traditions</seg>
<seg id="3"> In yesterday's episode I said that the groom's father or one of his relatives used to spend a whole week atop his horse inviting people to his son's wedding. But today, with the progress that has occurred and the blind following of fashion, this custom that used to increase social cohesion has changed, and its place has been taken by embellished paper invitations sent by mail, fax or delivered by hand, as well as phone invitations that involve no travel, no matter that the guest is only meters away in the same suburb or village.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As for serving food to male and female guests, this too has changed with fashion. Men now serve food to women, where once women's celebrations were out of sight of the men. This occurs in the absence of silks and golden fingers who now spend their time solely in beautification, hairdressing, manicure, changing of the flowing, transparent robes on the hour, and continual dancing to the DJ equipment. Then the tables are set by men with food and desert, something no men of the past would have accepted as they were used to having women prepare the food while they ate and conversed.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Even the outdoor partying held in front of the groom's house, so that young and old could frolic and be merry to the tune of the zurna, the flutes and the drums has now been replaced by wedding halls and ballrooms rented for nearly five million, enclosed so that one can hear nothing but the booming sound of the DJ playing bands that don't know how to sing but do so in offensive and laughable words. The squandering and wastefulness reaches its climax in the wedding table utensils made of plastic, to be thrown away immediately after use, when once big families had their households full of wedding utensils to be used by neighbors and relatives. These expenses burden the groom and his family with debt which he will be repaying for years to come.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Change touched even the wedding night rites. Instead of the spouses spending their night at the family house after the party was over and the invited outsiders - as we call them here - departed, leaving only the bride's and groom's relatives, everyone now prefers renting a room in a hotel at high prices to be added to the rest of the burdens.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Even food is no longer limited to couscous, soup or chakhchoukha. Instead they are replaced by sweet soup, olives and other foods.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Speaking of these changes that have happened to Gualma's wedding traditions, my uncle Mohammed who is an 80 year old man said after sighing - as if he had returned to his younger days - "Alas! for the olden days and their weddings. They lasted seven days and they were then done in good faith, and blessed and modest."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My uncle Mohammed continued telling me about his wedding day: "I was 17 then when my father married me off. I knew the wedding was happening while I was harvesting wheat, and I had no break except when the bride arrived. I had not seen her before the wedding night but we lived together until now, because there was a strong determination to preserve a cohesive family with love and happiness, not like your generation - you marry in summer and divorce in winter."</seg>
<seg id="10"> Hajja Fatima, 76, answered when I asked her about weddings in the past, "Our opinions about our marriage were not important, and this did not apply only to the bride. Even the groom was not asked about who to betroth, because parents at that time were choosing the groom, and what trousseau the bride will take with her to her married home and the date of the wedding."</seg>
<seg id="11"> "Everything in our days was simple. The dowry never exceeded 500 centimes, and the bride's trousseau was a veil and a small bag with a pair of embroidered  dresses. The wedding lasted seven days and nights, with Rahaba songs, drums, the zurna and firing of guns. As for food, the main dish at olden weddings was the couscous and grilled wheat with dates (rafeis)." She said that on her wedding her husband killed 24 rams to feed the guests, saying, "these were unforgettable days and thank God we lived in understanding and happiness and did not have the kind of troubles your generation has. Despite all its prosperity it is not stable, and what we call the high level of celibacy among young males and females is nothing but proof of fear of the unknown before embarking on marriage.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Arab Elections. In civilized countries, candidates for general elections comply with standards aiming at bringing in those who have the merit, educational and cultural qualifications, and good character so as to activate the role of the legislative councils in the service of the country and the people in the interest of a stable state.</seg>
<seg id="3"> General elections in Arab countries instead are a show of democracy played on the stage of the regimes, and aims at bringing in the worst members in the loyalist parties to the parliamentary seats. This is done by preparing lists of candidates with political immunity that support them in winning, regardless to their educational and cultural qualifications and whether they are more concerned about the welfare of their pockets than that of the country.</seg>
<seg id="4"> How votes are collected varies from one candidate to the other. We see one setting up tents, spreading food and the occasional water pipe and live music, while another roams the electoral seat, stepping into a wake and sobbing over the dear departed by force to obtain the votes of the bereaved and maybe of the departed as well - then off to a wedding hall to congratulate another voter on his marriage.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Some may resort to innovative campaigning methods, like distributing sweets with their name and photo on them, risking a raise in blood sugar if he loses the election.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Some others insist on embarking on the election battle, despite being sure they won't win, to influence one candidate at the expense of another from behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Most Arab candidates can't think straight or express themselves well, and yet they climb onto rostrums and pulpits and fire statements about promising employment opportunities, wage increases and free education that make us feel sorry about the statements made by Al-Sahhaf about the American asses, except that Al-Sahhaf did not commit the crime of butchering the Arabic language.</seg>
<seg id="8"> As soon as the elections are over, the candidates draw out the swords with which to cut off the heads of the poor, then off they fall asleep satiated with abundance of good food, surrounded by the hearts of those on ruined incomes longing for cod oil and jerky.</seg>
<seg id="9"> As for the presidential elections in our democratic countries, known as the Fast Food Elections, these elections have converted our people into mummies that walk submissively to the ballot boxes to produce an election landslide of 99%, a rate only ever achieved by saints and holy men.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Occupation Forces Deny the Child Aseel the Realization of Her Dream To Represent Palestinian Kids At the Folk Dabke Festival in Qatar. Salfeet - MAAN - Aseel sighed deeply as tears rolled over her naturally ruddy soft cheeks, adding beauty to the innocence of a childhood deprived of the simplest human rights by the occupation.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Aseel is 14. She is a dreamy but lively and energetic child, who loves the world and its beauty despite the dark days her people are going through. Aseel is a member in a local dabke troupe in Ramallah, and dances her role extremely well and artfully. She hoped to be able to participate in a festival in which she could show off her talent and artistic abilities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> And finally the chance came for Aseel to travel with her troupe to Qatar to perform there, and for another performance in Oman. Aseel was over the moon and kept running around the house, kissing her mother and sisters and saying to her father, "My wishes have come true, I will travel and do the dabke and dance there, and present my country's heritage before the people of the Gulf."</seg>
<seg id="5"> But Aseel is the child of parents whose identification card was issued in Gaza, but live on the West Bank, because her family home is in a village near Qalqilia, where her father's and grandfather's land - tens of dunums and hundreds of olive trees whose roots are deeply embedded in the ground and whose branches hug the skies - bear witness that Aseel and her predecessors have been created here and are staying.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In a country torn by the occupation, Gaza residents are forced to get an exit and coordination permit from the occupying forces, to be able to return to their residences on the West Bank. Otherwise, they will be banished to Gaza and unable to return to the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Aseel's father applied to the Civil Coordination Office of the occupation forces to permit his daughter to leave with her troupe, but the occupation forces rejected Aseel's request and did not permit her to travel with her troupe to participate in the Qatar Festival.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Aseel returned to her home in Ramallah cursing the occupation, and life has engulfed her innocent child's face with darkness. What was her crime?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Why can't I travel with my troupe?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Why are they taking away our right to live like other people, said Aseel with anguish.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Al-Zahar makes public documents showing Fatah leaders embezzled billions from public money.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Mahmoud Al-Zahar, a leader in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) reviewed a bunch of documents and numbers that came under control in security headquarters, and which prove the financial and administrative corruption in which Fatah and Palestinian Authority leadership was involved.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At a political meeting held last night at the Grand Mosque in Al-Bureij Camp in central Gaza Strip, Al-Zahar said that Salam Fayyad was involved in corruption cases and that Hamas had the documentary evidence which it will present at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He confirmed that there are documents proving that Fatah's Central Committee investigated Salim Al-Zanoun, National Council Chairman, for embezzling 2 million dollars from public Palestinian funds.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He unveiled several embezzlements and unlawful exploitation of public money, in numbers that prove a number of Fatah leaders were involved, including among others Nabil Abu Rudeina, advisor to the Authority's President, Salam Fayyad, Mohammed Rashid, advisor to the late head of the Authority Yasser Arafat, and others.</seg>
<seg id="8"> At the meeting which was well attended by locals and residents, Al-Zahar said, "There are documents from the Monitoring Committee in the Legislature dated May 1997 which prove that financial corruption exceeded 326 million dollars and that Abu Rudeina obtained 33,000 dollars from Arafat for his daughters expenses in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He explained that, according to the documents, the Zionist occupation carried out an investigation of an oil tycoon, in the Zionist entity, called Ovadia Koko who was paying Mohamed Dahlan half a million shekels annually, and an equivalent amount to the Preventative on the Bank, and 400,000 to Rashid; and that all of them were engaged in [dealing in] false sales receipts.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Hamas leader confirmed that the Authority's policy was based on monopolies, and that none of its transactions were ever tendered, especially in oil, fruit and other goods, so that profits could be distributed among the top executives in the bodies and institutions of the Authority.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The documents also showed that the occupation refused to transfer one million shekels that an official was getting on a monthly basis from the revenue of Karni Crossing, adding that the February 2006 report of the Monitoring Committee at the Legislative Council shows a sudden disappearance of 315 million dollars from the Authority's budget, while investigations were afoot for another 700 million vanished dollars.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Al-Zahar read a bunch of documents and numbers that prove prominent leaders in Fatah and the Authority were involved in crimes of embezzlement and misuse of power for more than 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Crocker's Warnings Justify Occupation and Control Over the Oil Cake. Crocker: the violence that will happen in Iraq exceeds any imagination. The US Ambassador in Baghdad expects complete collapse of the Iraqi Security Forces under the force of sectarianism.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Occupied Baghdad - The US Ambassador to Baghdad Ryan Crocker told the New York Times that an early departure of the US Forces from Iraq, or its withdrawal to bases within it might lead to a sharp increase in violence that will result in the death of thousands.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The paper said that Crocker's statements were made in an interview it held with him on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The announcements coincide with growing fears amidst Iraqi leaders that the increased pressures on the US President George Bush will lead to premature withdrawal of US forces.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Iraqi leaders from various sects warned on Monday that an early withdrawal of US forces might draw the country into an extensive civil war.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The leaders were commenting on a separate report by the newspaper about the escalated debate in the White House over the gradual decrease of troops.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The White House denied the contents of the article.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Crocker, speaking on the probable escalation of violence in the event of US forces withdrawal, said, "You have to look at what the consequences would be, and you look at those who say we could have bases elsewhere in the country."</seg>
<seg id="10"> "Well yes, we could," he continued.  "But we would have the prospect of American forces looking on while civilians by the thousands were slaughtered. Not a pretty prospect."</seg>
<seg id="11"> Crocker and the US military commander Gen. David Petraeus will present in mid-September a report to the Congress about whether the large increase in US forces has succeeded in curbing the violence and whether political leaders in Iraq have made progress about national reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The Congress will hold this week what is expected to be an exciting discussion about the future and funding of the war, prior to an important report on Iraq presented to the Congress by the Administration by July 15.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Crocker said he based his warning on what he has noticed in the four months since he took up his post, his former experience of Iraq dating back to more than 25 years ago, and lessons learned during an assignment in Beirut in the early eighties.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The New York Times quoted Crocker as saying that failure of imagination made it impossible to foresee the extreme violence that enveloped Lebanon as it descended into civil war.</seg>
<seg id="15"> He added, "And I'm sure what will happen here exceeds any imagination."</seg>
<seg id="16"> The paper also said that Crocker mentioned a number of possibilities when discussing the risks resulting from the withdrawal of US forces.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He also said that this included the possibility that Iraq's 350,000-strong security forces would completely collapse under sectarian pressures, disintegrating into militias.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The Voice of Truth In the Grip of Ignoramuses. Auchi: Release the Kidnapped Journalist Alan Johnston For Palestine the Cause and the Country - British Arab Organization Joins the European Community of Activists Demanding the Release of the British Journalist.</seg>
<seg id="3"> London - A statement issued by the British Arab Organization said the chairman of the organization Nadhmi Auchi demanded that the kidnappers of the British journalist Alan Johnston release him for the sake of Palestine the cause and the nation.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The organization's statement mentioned that the echoes of the kidnapping of the British BBC station reporter Alan Johnston are causing many storms and objections worldwide, especially in the fields of speech and opinion. This was not an isolated case, repeated in Lebanon and in Iraq and other places, so that jailing opinion has almost become an Arab condition and therefore an accusation against us and disdain for our civilization. But free speech has always been the most loyal friend of the Palestinian people, regionally and internationally.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The statement is part of a widespread European campaign by a conglomeration of European press and Muslim organizations that is demanding the release of Johnston.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Auchi is participating in the campaign by Robert Menard, the chair of the Journalists Without Borders organization, Dalil Boubakr, chair of the French Council for the Muslim Faith, Malik Abouzaid, chair of Federation of French of Arab and Muslim Origins, Abderrahmane Dahmane, chair of France's Council of Muslim Democrats and Mohammed Bechari, chair of the National Federation of Muslims of France.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The British Arab Organization statement said that opinion and its defenders were one of the strong bastions on which Palestinians and Arabs built their hopes in revealing what is hidden and making facts public.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Now that one of the men of opinion has been kidnapped, what a huge cost is this going to be to us in terms of publicity and information?</seg>
<seg id="9"> How much will the patriotic and national struggle be taxed to pay?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Against this kidnapping, no matter what its motivation or basis, there will for sure be the accusation pointed at us, that we are peoples who do not differentiate between those who carry the pen and those who carry the gun, those who search for truth and those who compete in usurping the land.</seg>
<seg id="11"> We entreat you to release the British journalist, entreat you to safeguard the sanctity and respect of opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12"> We entreat you not to add to our adversaries new ones, instead we and you must present this proof that our cause is just and that we know who are the war mongers and who the callers for a just peace. It is not fair to mix the cards at a time when we are being continually clear who our real enemies are, and who are our friends.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In Britain voices come out in demonstrations to support you, and cry out advocating for your rights. So don't confuse them, and give your real enemies the chance to avenge themselves and create lies about your positions. Release the British journalist Alan Johnston for the sake of Palestine the cause and the nation.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Sardine Prices Increase Because of Natural and Occupational Reasons With the Moroccan Consumer As the First Victim. Moroccan coasts are experiencing an unprecedented exceptional situation of a huge decline in fish stocks that has reached scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="3"> And whereas responsible authorities are attributing this to new natural factors that have affected Moroccan waters and led to fish migration, sources expert in marine fishing on the other hand explain the phenomenon as overexploitation of the fish stock in the absence of a plan for surface fish, thus hugely draining the stock.</seg>
<seg id="4"> A number of international organizations, led by the Food and Agriculture Organization, have warned against such unacceptable practices as fishing huge amounts of fresh sardines suitable for human consumption and directing them to fish flour factories which processes them, instead of limiting itself to the decayed lots not suitable for direct human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Trucks used to stand waiting in a long line in front of the Al-Oyoun factories, coming from Al-Dakhila harbor, until Minister Leanser put an end to this crime by signing the National Surface Fisheries Plan that aims to rationalize the fishing of this type of fish on one hand and define the permitted fishing quantities for each industry, totaling million of tons annually, on the basis that the total stock is estimated at about eight million tons of which three million are exploitable. This despite the opposition shown by the lobbies that run the industries who were benefiting from the current situation and were behind the failure of previous ministers in implementing it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the second plan after the octopus plan which was put in place following the near extinction of this sea species.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ministry, which had allocated in the National Surface Fish Plan 80,000 tons for the production of protein rich fish flour, imposed upgrading of fish flour factories by closing down the factories that did not upgrade and modernize their production means and ensured environmental safety conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The message of the Umma was quick to warn of the exploitative practices used by many ships and the trucks that carried the sardines to the flour factories in full view of the authorities who kept quiet and played the spectator role.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the other hand, the deputy chair of the Central North Atlantic Fishing Chamber Kamal Sabri explained that fishmongers started to discern the importance of the local consumer market which has seen important changes in the past two years in terms of revenue, especially as these merchants started providing better offers than the factories.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In a special statement, Sabri emphasized that, for example, the price of sardines has gone up to 2.50 dirhams instead of 1.60 dirhams per kilogram in the southern areas harbors.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He added that the price of sardines in Casablanca has seen a rise on account of the decreased stock on one hand and the high demand for consuming this substance on the other hand, and is ranging from 10 to 20 dirhams per kilogram depending on quality.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The story of this family can be summarized in the daily suffering of the 18 months old child Feryal. We met her mother who was carrying her in the company of the chair of the Society for Advocacy for the Sick. Tears came ahead of the words of the mother who could not believe what happened to her innocent daughter.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The child was born with partial paralysis due to abnormal delivery, but could see. A few months later it became apparent that she was losing sight in her right eye.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Following a 6 months journey through hospitals and specialists, doctors assured her mother that she could be treated. But meanwhile, the eye started getting inflamed, so she took her to Wahran Hospital where she was put under medical observation for a whole week. Then the eye started going yellow, then covered in a milky film which took away her sight. This became apparent after medical examination in one of the clinics in Wahran, where she was told to treat her overseas.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Partial paralysis and blindness and everyday suffering with a difficult case. After yet another journey of seeking, Feryal bin Abdallah's mother was told that the surgery will cost 32 million centimes for each eye, making the sum about 64 million centimes in total, and that the only person who performs this type of surgery is Mrs Hartani in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Mrs Bin Abdallah stops speaking and her daughter's screams increase from time to time because of the continuous pain the child lives with, especially if sun rays are reflected on her face.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Then Mrs Bin Abdallah entreats all philanthropists or local authorities to look at her daily suffering because of the illness her daughter, who hasn't yet completed two years, has been suffering since her birth .</seg>
<seg id="9"> Daily suffering made worse by the difficult social situation of the family, as her father is unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> "I only wish for my child's sight to be restored and this tragedy to end," says her mother with her whole face awash in tears, begging every relevant person to lift the inequity off her family and her child which is silently dying.</seg>

<seg id="3"> You can get to know about these problems here, but no need to ban the child from enjoying the vacation, since effects of sun radiation are rare, but should be known and prevented.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The human body maintains its temperature of about 37 degrees, despite all changes in temperature around. In this way, the body guarantees the correct functionality of organs. On the other hand, a large drop or increase in temperature may harm the human body and the child.</seg>
<seg id="5"> So how does the human body maintain its temperature?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The body does so by balancing heat production and loss. The body produces heat through internal chemical reactions, known as metabolism, and through metabolism, foods are turned into energy. There is another source of heat in the body, which is the work of muscles through expended effort.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the other hand, the body cools itself by release of excess heat. This release occurs mainly by radiation and perspiration through the skin.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Reading In the Nation's Renaissance</seg>
<seg id="3"> The East is the cradle of religions and civilizations. But despite that it fell into the trap of cultural backwardness, and when it desired to rise again and change these miserable conditions, it found itself on a juncture not knowing which way to go, because each road has advocates who embellish the way.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This was the source of conflict in the East between pioneers of the renaissance and modernization. Some turned to the West, absorbing all it had unquestioningly and without separating the wheat from the chaff, while discarding all their doctrinal and cultural heritage.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Others turned to Islam, drawing from it the basics, frameworks, principles and methodologies without rejecting the West's values of economic and political renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="6"> On the margins of these two major trends live two groups: one group sees in Islam the safe refuge, a buttressed fort and helping guide to renaissance and strongly prohibits borrowing from the West any of the causes of its renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Then there is the undecided, baffled team which has not chosen a path, and does not know which way to face - Islam or the West?</seg>
<seg id="8"> The main problem between the two major trends is religion - the first group believes that the West progressed when it threw off religion, the authority of the Church, the domination of the popes and clerics, so if we want to follow the path of the renaissance, the only way to do so is to throw off religion and its values, and take on the new, alternative Western values.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The second team was moderate and fair, taking this from Islam's moderation - it did not blame Islam for the backwardness of the Muslims but tries instead to make this Islam the basis of a new revival, as in the early Islamic era, while taking into consideration the West's achievements as long as they don't touch on the doctrine or the culture.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A sound civilizational edifice has to have two wings: one spiritual and moral, and the other material. A civilization which neglects the soul, the values and the morals while progressing materialistically to the apex of what can be achieved is an aborted civilization - no sooner it spreads its wings than it falls from its height.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Teams of workers from Hebron City Council started this Monday morning to rehabilitate the hawkers market located in the area of Bab Al Zawiya in the city of Hebron.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Mayor of Hebron Khalid Al Osaily said in a statement, a copy of which reached Maan: "The municipality has painted sections dedicated for greengrocers, organized the sections and distributed them in a manner appropriate to the nature of activity therein."</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Mayor confirmed that the solution to the mobile stalls arbitrarily standing on the city's streets will not happen unless the traders and mobile stall owners relocate to the dedicated marketplace in an area in the city's center, thus creating some balance and ease of movement for the sellers and the buyers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Al Osaily added that the proximity of the market - which was designed and organized architecturally - to parking lots, city suburbs and nearby villages creates a good economic buzz for the sellers and makes buying for buyers easy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Al Osaily demanded that mobile stall owners relocate to the market as soon as possible, in the public interest of residents.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Hebron's Mayor Khalid Al Osaily revealed municipal work teams had apprehended 30 cases of water theft last month, adding that they continue to follow up on water loss to reduce it to the minimum, despite it being much better than in a number of Arab capitals, as water loss last month reached approximately 32%, while in the Arab capital it ranges between 50-54%</seg>
<seg id="4"> Al Osaily, speaking with our correspondent in Hebron, said, "We will try in the coming months to lower this loss percentage after improving the water grid, by apprehending and fining potable water thieves who use it in watering their farms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Al Osaily confirmed that the city does is not suffer from a potable water crisis but from certain faults in supplies from the Palestinian Water Authority due to faults in their wells that supply south of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "I personally follow up on the quantities of water that reach us, and check the records and contact the Water Authority," he added. "The quantity of water that we get on a daily basis ranges between 14,000 and 19,000 cups."</seg>
<seg id="7"> Al Osaily pointed out that Hebron municipality is working on erecting two reservoirs in the areas of Jabel Joher and Jabel Abu Ruman in the city, in cooperation with the United States Agency for International Development (or USAID), in addition to the two existing points on the water line connecting Halhoul and southern Hebron, which supply the reservoirs of Al-Manshar and Al-Jildah.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Al Osaily mentioned his request that the Israeli side provide Hebron with 7,000 to 8,000 cups of potable water daily through the Water Authority, which they promised to do.</seg>

<seg id="5"> Urgent: Kazimiyah Secret Prison Scandal Spreads Worldwide - Uncovered by a local resident, it dates back to Solagh's days in the [Ministry] of Interior.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Special (translation): An informed source told our website that the secret prison recently discovered in the city of Kazimiyah is operated by the extremist Badr militias and not even highest levels of government are aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> An important source in the government who refused to disclose his name revealed that the underground prison in Kazimiyah holds 415 people, all of whom are of Sunni denomination.</seg>
<seg id="8"> All the prisoners were detained during the time of the former Minister of Interior Bayan Solagh.</seg>
<seg id="9"> According to the source, the prison used to hold over 600 persons, all Sunni Arabs, among whom were pilots, generals and colonels, and army officers who held important positions in the former regime, together with ordinary citizens. The militias used to execute those prisoners and throw them onto the streets, until the number has currently dropped to 415.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The source said that the prison is situated beneath a two-storey building, is run by Badr Organization, was reported by someone who lives in the area and who passed on the information to staff in humanitarian organizations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the source, the prison is cleverly hidden , so that passers by on the street do not notice even a guard at the gate, and that the Americans probably passed it by numerous times.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He said that all these get 15 to 20 buckets of water per day and some little food, most of which is waste.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The sources indicate that the prisoners were kidnapped and there is no recorded information about them at the Ministry of Interior or with the Americans.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The well known Iraqi writer and journalist Hasan Al-Alwi, threatened in statements issued through the Kuwaiti Cable TV to publicize the names of Arab writers and journalists who used to receive monthly payments from Iraqi intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="4"> He said that they have to return the money they robbed from Iraq, and added that Iraqi writers and journalists in exile were living on European aid as political refugees while millions of Iraqi dinars were being distributed among Arab writers and journalists who were hirelings to Iraq's ruler. He said there are tens of press and satellite TV institutions that were financed by the Iraqi intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The US Foxtell Cable Network embarrassed the then Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al Muasher when it queried him on news published in the New York Times about discovered name lists of Jordanian writers and journalists who were paid monthly wages from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is known that Saddan Hussein had built for the Jordanian journalists an elegant residential suburb in one of Amman's posher suburbs, and gave them free villas. He also dispensed free Mercedes Ghost cars to the chief editors and CEOs of Jordanian papers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The lists, to be published soon, contains names such as Mahmoud Kayed, Sultan Hattab, Mohammed Alamad; Khairi Mansour; Khalil Al-Sawahri who owns a publishing house financed by the Iraqi intelligence; the publisher of Al-Hilal magazine Ahmed Salama and Hamadeh Faraneh. It also contains the names of owners of the Addustour Magazine published in London, the Chief Editor of Al Watan Al Arabi and a large number of Lebanese and Egyptian journalists, most prominent being Fouad Matar and Amin Iskander, and names of Kuwaiti journalists such the owner of Alseyassah newspaper, Ahmed Jarallah</seg>

<seg id="3"> Deir Al Saleib, the Crusader Burgués Castle on the Hama - Masyaf road, then 6 km on the public road will get you to Deir Al Saleib. The convent is built on a rocky plateau and faces the modern village on the opposite plateau that faces south east.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Built from rough hewn rock using ancient stones taken from old buildings of which nothing is left but a single building in the center of the village known as the Castle, or as Crusader Burgués Castle.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is a two storey tower of which only the lower is still standing, while the high wall of the second contains four defense balconies.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The walls of the convent were built of hewed stones based on the rock without foundations. There is a press for dried sultanas, and a millstone for flour. Between the church and the archaeological site nearby there is another open-air olive press.</seg>
<seg id="7"> As the rare water springs dried up, the residents of the convent were forced to collect water into depositories and uncovered tanks.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The first thing that meets the visitor is the 80 cm high barrier that surrounds the convent's building and the cemetery. The main façade of the church was the worst destroyed, with only two large panels on the south and north sides still standing.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The floor of the main courtyard was paved with mosaics, but that was torn out and only the border remains.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The graveyard is a cubic building made of large stones, and contains a room with three large graves. On the stone face above each grave a small window has been drilled that is wider on the inside and narrowing towards the outside. Archbishops were buried here.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The mosaic on the floor of the Diaconicon's room represents a square plaque with a decorative frame that represents many different types of birds and small animals amongst the vine branches laden with fruit, with baskets placed nearby. In addition, there are 9 equal squares with images of four girls within them representing the four seasons, each one wearing what represents a season, and a wild bull, a leaping lion and a bird with a long beak. They are believed to be from the fifth century AD.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Another church 3 km east of the convent within a rocky area and an olive grove has three entries - we read on the frame of the door in Greek "Year 605 AD". The church is surrounded by the remains of a necropolis.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Jerusalem Medal For Fighting or Opposing Hamas</seg>
<seg id="3"> Jerusalem Medal For Fighting or Opposing Hamas, by Mufid Al Khalid</seg>
<seg id="4"> We haven't heard much about you, Jerusalem Medal, although the last seven years were full of honorable deeds of men who deserve to be highly honored for them, and who also deserve to have their honoring linked with the name of Jerusalem which they defended with their blood, money and posterity. But, as they say, we are in the age of wonders and upturned measures.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Shortly after the events of Gaza, Jerusalem Medals started raining on some persons who never ever had anything in common except fighting Hamas Movement, criticizing it, or opposing it. Today, as soon as you criticize Hamas for what it did in Gaza, you will get this honor called Jerusalem Medal. And who from?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Directly from the President, without delay or hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Those who hand out these honors have ignored two important things. The first is that this honoring will not change facts at all, and that this honoring will not fool the Palestinian people in any way. It will not change a traitor into an honorable man, or a murderer into a mujahid. Samih Al Madhoun will not, for example, change from a murderer into a mujahid, and those whom he attacked, whose houses he burnt and whose children he orphaned will not forget.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The second is that whoever is granted the Jerusalem Medal needs to be a defender of Jerusalem and the Aqsa, not their seller and forfeiter. We all know, and you yourself have admitted and gloated about being one of the engineers of Oslo which forfeited our rights, land and Jerusalem. You are still continuing in your policies, forfeiting rights from day to the next, and practicing all kinds of impieties against Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Real honoring is that by Allah, then the nation and the history, on the balance of truth and sacrifices. The real Jerusalem Medal used to be given - and still is - by the people to fighters and heroes when they come out with the martyr carried above their heads, announcing their love for him, their pledge and their loyalty.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Thousands of souls burnt by sun rays, 28 ascended to their creator complaining of human injustice, and more are on their way.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Oh God,  what crime have frail old and suckling babies committed by the reckoning of hateful, dirty politics?</seg>
<seg id="5"> What sin did they commit, oh God? From gate to gate, between cousins and traitors, kissing the blood-stained hands so that they can regain control over their land and their lives?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Answer me - what sin have they committed to remain stuck for five weeks at the Rafah Crossing without being allowed to pass into Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Where are these sovereignty agreements and abiding by it (as is alleged)? Why do they get lost between Fatah and Hamas reckonings over power? And what power?</seg>
<seg id="8"> Abbas requests from the Zionist entity to permit those stuck to enter through Karam Abu Salim, but Hamas refuses and says that this is not for their sake, but that Abbas knows there are among them people wanted by the Zionist entity and that this act means a return to direct Israeli control of the crossings (as if that wasn't there already). You can't cover the truth with a half-lie!!!</seg>
<seg id="9"> I wonder here why the Egyptian Government does not open the Rafah Crossing and permit those stuck at it to pass instead of keeping them hanging between heaven and earth. Can't the Egyptian Government do this on the basis of agreements signed with the usurping entity?</seg>
<seg id="10"> I believe it could, if it wanted to do so.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Why do these people have to be lost amidst vendettas over an incomplete power? Why don't we see Arab action to try and resolve the problem and save 6,000 souls standing with their hands outstretched to Allah, praying he would release them from their captivity and heal their wounds?</seg>

Congratulations, this is the first time we get the first place internationally for anything, and we won this one with a high margin of 87%. There is no one like us in the world, we have no competition. Oh world, what's wrong with the Egyptian Government - it is providing us with everything, and whatever we wish for, we get.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Elections? None more fair, nor transparent and so pure - purer than milk.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Wages? The Egyptian employee does not know what to spend his wage on, it is so much that it is enough and more than enough..</seg>
<seg id="6"> Health? Oh, the joy of my sight - health and hospitals in Egypt have no equal in Europe and developed countries. You could even be admitted missing an eye, or a leg, or a kidney and they'd fit you with one without you asking or knowing!</seg>
<seg id="7"> I don't want to continue and name all the achievements of the Egyptian Government, as they are obvious and clear and do not need to be explained, people. I object and condemn this report. Besides, we should take the first place among people who are happy with their people, and besides the 87% does not look like ours and is weird. We have a specific percentage, known worldwide, and we neither drop nor go above it. It is 99.9%. I really don't know where this report got this forged percentage from? Maybe someone has incited them against us?</seg>

<seg id="3"> In the address of the President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak celebrating "that glorious revolution" - the phrase is not mine, it appeared on the screen during the address - throughout his address the President said something to the effect that his regime was an extension of the July Revolution. That is not true, for the Revolution ended fully with the end of October War.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The great Egyptian poet Sayyed Hijab said yesterday, "The Revolution ended when Mohamed Abdel Ghano Al Jamasi walked out of the tent at K101 crying and saying that President Sadat was surrendering more than the necessities that the military situation demanded" *** On the same day, this being a permanent procedure that becomes more concentrated with every anniversary of the Revolution, official channels and government papers stage a violent campaign against all that the Revolution represents.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is not my aim here to state my opinions about the Revolution and its achievements, or my personal attitude to Abdel Nasser, that eternal leader. The self-evident question for any layman is: if that dead, abominable rule being cursed by the regime's media day and night is the origin, and the current regime is nothing but its extension, as the head of the regime has affirmed, why is the regime still here?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Of course the achievements of the infrastructure are not good enough as an answer to this question after the latest revolution of the parched. But let us be comforted: infrastructure at the Marina Resorts is wonderful and there is plenty of water, thank God.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Al-Shabiba - Occupied Gaza has seen in the recent days successive attacks by Hamas security forces against a number of sites, places, persons and employees. Hamas security campaign was against the National Authority's institutions, their employees, and against families and weddings in a number of areas.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The most prominent among the assaults was the targeting of Al Azhar University which tends to stay well out of Hamas' control. It neighbors the Islamic University but does not raise a green flag, and it seems to refuse to raise a white flag. The attack was preceded by threatening the Chancellor of the university to make him lower Fatah's flags raised in some places within the university.</seg>
<seg id="5"> And since the request was not fulfilled, it was attacked in an unprecedented defiance, especially as Hamas Movement previously assured educational and learning institution would not be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> But since the "National Pay Day" Hamas security forces tended towards the escalation and terrorization of those who comply with the directives of the official government and rejecting the "popular government" of Hamas. It also targeted certain leaders in the official institution, all of which is but a clear and obvious expression of a confusion that will increase with time. The reckonings of the palace never did, nor will, agree with the reckonings of villages!</seg>

<seg id="2"> Talent Suckers</seg>
<seg id="3"> The comment of brother Owner of the Weeping Pen, Knight of the Kingdom about the theft of his works by a blogger caught my eye.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the beginning I didn't believe it, but then I went back and started researching the issue of intellectual property theft on Google, to be appalled by the number of hits that had exceeded 2 million that ranged from protection laws to incidents, news and complaints.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I passed over them quickly and despite hearing of many of these incidents I never paid much attention to them until brother Owner of the Weeping Pen placed me before the fact, making me rethink the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For more on the issue of brother Owner of the Weeping Pen please click on this link http://fareselmamlaka.maktoobblog.com/.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Theft is a serious issue, repudiated by religion and law, and by all healthy psyches.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is an act which, if it benefits one today, won't benefit him on the Judgment Day, and may one day be discovered, sooner or later. There are many examples of that. I don't believe that theft is limited to professional thieves or deviants; instead it has become an enjoyable practice for the reckless young seeking quick fame.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Add to this that the issue has reached our universities and schools, and even media and government departments, from employees to the intellectual elites of whom some became prominent through this practice. As for trade and business, you can talk about this without embarrassment, as these practices are occurring day and night, and every second there is a theft of ideas, inventions and research in all parts of the world, the heroes being either intelligence officers, or professional thieves, or intellectual or political elites, or businessmen.</seg>
<seg id="10"> These talent suckers and thieves of intellectual property are expanding in their business freely despite strict legislation. The restraint of conscience was one of the most important reasons of the spread of such practices, particularly as fame and prominence became an economic resource of the individual in a world short on resources. No hour passes without a news star, big-time critic, fearless journalist and experienced politician popping up, with whom the cable TV channels, newspapers and magazines compete making him the talk of the hour when time is limited for others.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Look at your mother and how tears have not dried in her eyes, and your wife, how bereaved she is of you. And your father, how he misses you. Look at the suffering of your children after you. Look, and look, and imagine and imagine. Take time looking and imagining, then open your eyes and count with me how much pain and adversity befell those whom you love because of your death. Oh, death is hard. But it is our fate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After all this sympathize while watching the satellite TV stations and hearing that 40 unidentified bodies were found today in Baghdad then turning to another channel, seeing that 50 unidentified bodies were found in various districts of Baghdad, while a third channel diminishes this daily news to describe it as a discovery of 30 unidentified bodies.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Now that you have heard this painful news, return to imagining; but imagine while sympathizing not with the extent of adversity that had afflicted those 40, or 50, or only 30 - despite all the pain of torture - but with the adversity and pain that has befallen 50 families who lost a father and bread-winner, leaving kids who don't understand why their father was killed, and who will support them from now on; the mother who is wailing and wailing for the husband who left a few hours ago hoping to come back with their needs.. but instead.. You can also imagine and sympathize with the mother whose two children have been placed before her, killed when they haven't even reached puberty, tears streaming down her face and her hands refusing to let go of their bodies, patting and kissing them, not understanding why they were killed. May God help you, Iraq, may God help you, Iraq. What did you do to be killed, Iraq? Maybe what I have mentioned has been the experience of the family of one of those daily 50 people, of whom the forensic hospital has become tired of, and so have our souls before it.. not knowing if one day we will be one of them, since we have been defined as Iraqis??</seg>
<seg id="6"> God knows!!!</seg>
<seg id="7"> The destruction of the Kaaba is easier on God than the murder of a Muslim. You were right, oh Prophet of Allah. Our blood and souls no longer have any sanctity in this painful situation. 105 killed in one hour in Tozkharmatou. 560 killed in Baghdad last month, which means that 560 families in Iraq last month had a calamity. And only in Allah is the strength and the power.</seg>

<seg id="2"> My Experience II: The Camp. At the Aswan Camp I saw a totally new world.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was the first camp in my life.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After a long trip - 16 hours - and fear of the train that vanished on our arrival in Cairo, we got there on Friday. We stayed at the International Mubarak Hostel facing the stadium. We got a room for four, all of us from Alexandria. I ran to the bed by the window. Then we got to meet the administration of the camp, followed by a get-together session with the youth of three other provinces: Sohag, Aswan and Beni Suweif. The day over, we of course didn't go to sleep - we went downtown, and what a beauty! We were supposed to come back at 12.00. Who? We are Alexandrians, so we got back at 3.50 AM, and yes, we did get a talk down, but that's OK. Starting from the second day, one patters till the end of the camp. Up at 7.00 AM, incredibly stuffy as we were there in March and it was very hot. Then morning exercise at the stadium from 8.00 to 9.00 AM, running around the track - pull your stomach in and relax your legs - followed by breakfast at 9.00, some beans, a piece of cheese, two slices of bread and a cup of tea. At 10.00 work starts - we split into four committees: order, environment, evaluation and culture. In my group we created an internal structure. I nominated myself for the committee magazine editor and won with a landslide 11 to 4 votes because of the generosity of the guys from Sohag. The committees present from 11.00 to 12.00 every day. Then a specific subject every day: political, economic, sociological - we split into four teams and train with a supervisor on how to debate, research, and find information about the subject. We present it to the visiting professor in that field after lunch from 3.00 to 4.00. From 7.00 to 9.00 committee work, then a free tour around the city, officially until 12.00 but amicably until 2.30; and of course discussions with the youth from the provinces and wonderful university lecturers.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Fabulous Syrian Effort To Eliminate the Terrorist Act Hypothesis</seg>
<seg id="4"> Ahmed Mouwaffak Zaidan. One feels puzzled following the fabulous efforts that the Syrian authorities have done and are still doing to eliminate the hypothesis of terrorist act in what happened at the School of Infantry in Aleppo, in northern Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5"> As if the poor soldiers, who have no power or strength to face the sectarian cancer that is spreading in beloved Syria, as if it made a big difference if they died in a car bomb or as a result of the negligence of authorities incapable of storing their weapons and ammunition instead of ranting about fighting the Jews.</seg>
<seg id="6"> ....</seg>
<seg id="7"> Once more one recollects that surreal spectacle on the eve of the withdrawal of the Syrian troops from Lebanon under the warnings of the new Gouraut, Bush; recollecting that surreal depressive spectacle of the withdrawal of forces that possessed only such rubble of army gear that made every Syrian or Muslim embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Broken tables, pale faces, no smiles - everything broken and too embarrassing to be carried or approached.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Of course it is nothing strange for armies to look like this as long as they carry in their hearts a faith that explodes like volcanoes, but everyone knows that the prima facie of our army is the best manifestation of its essence.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Strange is this sectarian regime, strange in its logic and even stranger its bosses who showed up on satellite TV channels to swear by the greatest oaths that a terrorist act is not a probability, while being as silent as graves about the person responsible for the tragedy, and how it will be dealt with, and holding accountable those who caused the death of these lives .</seg>
<seg id="11"> We all know what happened to those responsible for the Zaizoun Dam, and prior to that the handing over of Golan and Qunaitarah, and the massacres spread over time and place, and the catastrophes, adversities and calamities of Suleiman, his grandfather and his grandson...</seg>

<seg id="2"> Tahla: Shops For Itinerant Merchants Opened</seg>
<seg id="3"> As part of the projects suggested by the local committee of the National Initiative for Human Development in Tahla, the Governor of Taza Region visited Tahla on Monday, July 23, 2007 to announce the start of work on the projects funded by the National Initiative for Human Development Fund.</seg>
<seg id="4"> One of the projects that were concentrated on was the building of commercial premises for the benefit of itinerant merchants</seg>
<seg id="5"> What follows is a technical description of the project: Site: city center, the local market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Targeted category: Tahla's itinerant merchants</seg>
<seg id="7"> Components of the project: 45 commercial premises, patrol center, toilets for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Area covered: 323 square meters</seg>
<seg id="9"> Funding source: the National Initiative for Human Development Fund (400,000 dirhams); local budget (600,000 dirhams); Tahla Urban Society (land).</seg>
<seg id="10"> Expected Duration of Project: 4 months</seg>
<seg id="11"> Tender was won by the Sidak Company in Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Unit cost is 22,200 dirhams per commercial premise.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The follow-up of operations will be supervised by the General Secretary for Labour.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The inauguration celebrations were attended by the Mayor of the City Council and some of its members, representatives from the local committee for Human Development, members of the Quds District Revitalization Team and heads of departments.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Some residents were astonished by the presence of their representatives despite the problems in administering local affairs in Tahla.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The question remains: how will these commercial premises be distributed?</seg>
<seg id="17"> What are the criteria for investiture?</seg>
<seg id="18"> And finally, what are the chances of success of this project which was planned in the absence of the stakeholders?</seg>
<seg id="19"> The conditions of success of a business venture depends on choosing the right site.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Is the vacant lot behind the local market practicable?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Is the local market popular and does it have a turnout that can contribute to the popularity of the shops made for the itinerant merchants?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Didn't an investor in the past use two shops in this same lot to sell fish, but had to give up on his project?</seg>
<seg id="23"> And finally, who will visit shops that are situated next to the largest garbage dump in the town's center?</seg>
<seg id="24"> When residents of the town of Tahla are forced to visit the local market, they think a thousand times about the stench and the swarms of flies that surround the market. So did the Local Council in Tahla consider the health situation of these shops, or are they just going to make things worse?</seg>
<seg id="25"> And what role does the Health Department in Tahla's Council play?</seg>

<seg id="6"> My question is, why is the forbidden always desirable?</seg>
<seg id="7"> </seg>
<seg id="8"> The child only plays with what is forbidden, and in the garden only goes to where it is forbidden, and doesn't like eating except all the forbidden sweets and fries.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The young men and women in adolescence have no other interest but to break the boundaries of all that is forbidden, to do it despite the results and consequences.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A girl forbidden to go online does so oblivious of rebukes, and logs on the Messenger to talk to all and sundry.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A youth spend all the time in marketplaces, molesting and flirting and befriending evil friends, not caring about any reprimands that will follow.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Any forbidden commodity on the market and we find ourselves chasing after it and pay double its price to get it.</seg>

<seg id="2"> A Vision: My sister came to me to tell me about a dream she had in her sleep. She said, "I saw you preparing to travel to an Arab state, me and a group of friends; you were going on a scholarship and getting ready to leave quickly. You were with another girl, who seemed to be closer to you than the rest, and you were happy and excited that you were leaving. End. Now I know.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Travel = new life, and I am in fact approaching a new life. What good news!</seg>
<seg id="4"> It has almost come true. As for the girl that seemed to be closer to me than the rest of the girls, I discovered during a phone call to one of my friends that she works in the place where I have applied for a small position in this world!</seg>
<seg id="5"> I felt that the place suited her a lot, but when I spoke with her she seemed upset and bored with the place. I know it and met a number of officials there, but she doesn't know that. I follow a prophetic policy that the Prophet recommended (use secrecy when attending to your business), and this is what I did. When the matter becomes official and I am chosen, then I will tell her everything :-) ------------------</seg>

<seg id="2"> A Department For Financial Disclosure!!</seg>
<seg id="3"> Towards the Establishment of an Absolutely Neutral and Independent Department For Financial Disclosure!</seg>
<seg id="4"> Our praiseworthy deputies have now completed the second round of the 11th Legislative Session, following rounds of political discussions and attacks, mostly sharp but sometimes agreeable, which  - thank God - ended in what it ended in: the endorsement of the state's general budget for the coming financial year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I really hoped that the Financial Standing Disclosure Act would be endorsed, as it is one of the strongest and most important tools in combating corruption in Kuwait, and will no doubt become the reason in establishing the principle of integrity and transparency, and prevent administrative and executive vice and transgressions in stated sectors no matter what they are.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This Act will become a dividing line between clean conscience and honorable honesty and between the disgraceful cheating and administrative corruption.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Illegal profit making is an offensive characteristic in any society, and sticks to its owner very persistently, permeating to become an inalienable part of him. It helps in creating adverse and very bad class and social distinctions that could lead to bad consequences within the folds of society, not to mention implying that theft of state property and wealth is everyone's legal right!!</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is sad, and at the same time embarrassing, that the discussion of this legislation and its endorsement was deferred under the pretext that the work program of the National Assembly was full with questioning and other activities on the Assembly's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I hope we don't have to wait long and that we see the endorsement of the Financial Standing Disclosure Act at the next session, and God willing at its first meeting next October .. that is before the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In the end we have to look very rationally into making the body that will carry out this legislation fully and totally neutral and independent from the government, comparable to the well-reputed Accounting Department.</seg>
<seg id="11"> And it would be good if the Department For Financial Disclosure, were to become an important pillar of our free, democratic society and an important cultural support for integrity and transparency in the State of Kuwait.</seg>

This is a very remote probability because the distance between the two places is multiplied by a cosmic number, but would the reaction be like the first one?</seg>
<seg id="4"> The picture would , for sure, be different in terms of response and the speed with which the problem is solved, because the intestines of the "tantes" cannot bear the simplest of germs that have sneaked into the water despite the safety precautions of water filters.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For sure a fattened scapegoat will be provided to placate the anger of public opinion as quickly as the air motor pumps water. In addition, private hospitals will give their patients the red carpet treatment because treatment bills will be expensive, and the council will move to dig streets without leaving holes so as to modernize the network on that street, while the digital ministers will hurry to the area simply because they either reside there or somewhere nearby.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> They Are Devastating the Trees. We found out that the council have chopped down the ornamental trees on the main road that divides Najran city into two.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It didn't chop it down fully, but left the trunk and a few branches and took off the leaves, the greenness and the shade it provided for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It looks horrid to a great extent, as if we were in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I do not think there is an obvious reason for this action and the reason why I found the chopped trees lying in the middle of the road till they dried.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even if there was a good reason for doing this, what's the benefit of leaving the trees in this condition?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Do they think they are going to go back to their previous state?</seg>
<seg id="8"> .</seg>
<seg id="9"> I don't know much about planting ornamental trees, and whether they can come back after their limbs have been chopped off.</seg>
<seg id="10"> But the general view of the road lacks the beautiful green color and some of the coolness these trees were providing especially in the burning summer season.</seg>
<seg id="11"> What are they going to add?</seg>
<seg id="12"> I don't know.. all I know is that they are chopping down the trees!</seg>
<seg id="13"> Another point that the residents and visitors to the area notice is the poor way in which this same road is surfaced, and particularly after the recent projects during which the road was dug more than once.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The road gets dug once, twice, and even thrice and it doesn't get restored to what it was.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The road has really become like glass that cannot be fixed after being broken.</seg>
<seg id="16"> People complain daily about this road so much that the council is ignoring or willfully ignoring it more than once.</seg>
<seg id="17"> A few days ago I saw some machines filling in some holes on the road, as if to allude that repairing and surfacing it fully is far off in the future, if ever.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Woman Between House Work and Male Domination</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Woman Between House Work and Male Domination</seg>
<seg id="3"> Eastern societies differ in their customs and traditions from Western cultures..</seg>
<seg id="4"> The strongest reason for the backwardness of the eastern societies is probably the adherence to these customs that have nothing to do with religion or morals.</seg>
<seg id="5"> One of these customs current at this time is that erroneous perception of woman, and that she is meant to be at the service of the house starting with cooking and food preparation, to cleaning the house, washing dishes and clothes and ironing. This is the reality in most of the countries in the Middle and Far East. The male doesn't know how to cook, or clean the house, or wash clothes or do other housework. Instead he considers this to be the woman's job whether she is his mother, sister, wife or daughter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> So regardless to what the woman's occupation is outside the house - a clerk, a laborer, or a holder of graduate degrees - she must be a good housewife. We see the clerk doing housework after coming home from work, and usually preparing next day's meals at night. As for weekends, these provide the woman with an opportunity to deal with tasks backlogged during the working week. If we do some arithmetic and calculate the hours the woman works outside of home and added the hours of housework to that, we would find that the poor soul did not enjoy a single day of leave, not even once a year.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This is for women who work outside of home. As for the unemployed housewife, she too is afflicted with no leave to enjoy at all, and works from getting up from sleep to bedtime.</seg>
<seg id="8"> As for Mr. Male, he is blessed with a waiver on housework, and only required to work outside the house. When he shows up at home, he shows up ordering and forbidding. All his demands are complied with - and if only he was content or convinced. Instead you find him perpetually grouchy; the kitchen is not to his liking, the clothes not washed properly, and so on with his feeble objections as if he was dealing with a servant employed by him.</seg>
<seg id="9"> So what is the reason of this phenomenon prevalent among most eastern people? Is it a religious heritage, or a conventional social tradition?</seg>
<seg id="10"> What is man who forced woman into this thing? Or did woman give man power over herself and made him the master?</seg>
<seg id="11"> ِAs for religion, according to what is prescribed and constant among the public and the elites is that the responsibility for running the house falls on the male - he is either to do it himself or rent out a special worker for service.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The religion has not imposed housework on the woman. On the contrary, if the wife gives birth to a child, the father has to arrange a wet nurse for it, and if his mother was to breastfeed it, he must obtain her permission. She could make it a condition to be paid for the breastfeeding, and the same applies to the wet nurse.</seg>
<seg id="13"> So the issue is no more but a creation of customs and traditions. Maybe what helped it to spread and become common was poverty. In most ages of humanity, and even in this age. Because the husband cannot provide the wages of the housekeeper and barely provide food, and since most of the time the woman is unemployed, she has joined forces with him. He works to provide for the livelihood and she works at home. To assist the man was a good step on the part of the woman, but man exploited this assistance and as generations passed made it into a social law.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The matter was not limited to those in need, but passed on to the rich. Man started feeling it was his right that the woman serves him and complies with his household demands. Will woman, after having consented to this and accepted it from man, be able now to rid herself of this problem and does man know that he has treated woman unjustly?</seg>
<seg id="15"> This depends on woman herself. She has firstly to demand her right to equality with man and secondly, man has to become aware of this issue and really feel that the woman is his total equal. And since we are calling for a total equality between woman and man, we also call for man to share living responsibilities in the house and outside of it with woman, as is the situation in most western states. This way, neither will man be the master of the house, nor woman its lady; instead they will be both partners in everything.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Institutional Work</seg>
<seg id="3"> There are many active leaders that produce lots of creativity in many scientific, professional, artistic and political domains.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It consolidates rules, makes theories and draws visions for the future in accordance with sound and studied plans. These programs and plans take a long time, great effort and much money. Then comes the mechanism of executing in reality these projects, plans, ideas, suggestions and theories,</seg>
<seg id="5"> on which great effort, much toil and huge sums were expended, and they are carried out in real life in a long or short time span. And suddenly we are surprised from one day to another that those ideas and plans have disappeared, and that suggestion was removed or that activity vanished. And when we look for the reasons</seg>
<seg id="6"> why these programs, or plans and projects vanished it becomes clear that the leaders who adopted this idea had for one  reason or another vanished.</seg>
<seg id="7"> An example of this is the idea of an activity that has been extinguished with the death of Dr. Mohamed Rashid, and the idea of the pioneering schools that disappeared with the departure of some of the directors at the Ministry,</seg>
<seg id="8"> and the idea of learning resources on which the Ministry spent millions of riyals and has not till now been implemented at the ideal level equivalent to the expenditure..</seg>
<seg id="9"> Also the idea of the electronic government adopted by His Highness Prince Muqran bin Abdul Aziz who was interested in its implementation and held many press meetings, for this and other administrative reasons,  with the heads of all the civil and military sectors. These meetings were attended by businessmen</seg>
<seg id="10"> from the Medina region. When Prince Muqran died, the idea didn't disappear but the interest in it was not like in the past.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Among the new ideas is also the idea of the new post under the slogan "Address Without Going In Circles" adopted by the General Post institution, and which was being implemented in many of Medina's districts. Boxes started to be distributed and placed in houses, and almost 60% of Medina's districts were covered.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In my opinion this idea was not thoroughly researched. Many of our writers wrote about it in the local papers, as it would have been more appropriate to survey the residential districts and only number them, then provide the postal service to those who want it. Instead what happened was a clear waste of the institutions funds, as most boxes placed on houses were vandalized.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In all cases we need disciplined, communal institutional work. This institutional work will create future visions for all programs or projects or systems or decisions. Then the worthy among these will be approved following thorough research by those qualified.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This institutional work will prevent any program or project from being affected by the departure of a person or the arrival of another, because work is codified in accordance with a specific mechanism and clear-cut standards and strategies.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Tiredness and Stress</seg>
<seg id="3"> Man needs to exert some effort to improve his performance, but excessive stress leads to many adverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Stress is a state of fatigue due to physical tiredness, sickness or psychological exhaustion.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Tiredness and stress are dangerous things that can lead to the destruction of civilizations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Man should not labor and exert himself without resting.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Rest after work is as necessary as food.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Tiredness takes away man's endurance, so circumstances overwhelm him and he feels everything is magnified, and is dwarfed by it.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Tiredness is the main precursor to physical illness.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Tiredness and exhaustion lead to an increase in hormone levels in the blood and one of these hormones is adrenaline which causes hypertension, as well as hormones that lead to failure of the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Also, this tiredness can be related to other illness such as stomach and intestinal problems, influenza, herpes and some types of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Symptoms of stress are: increased heart rate, hypertension, nervous tension, mental lethargy and lack of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="13"> To lower stress, it is advisable to have sugary substances for breakfast and limit laxatives which lead to the loss of vitamins A and D, causing stress and tiredness.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In Reality</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In Reality. In reality I can no longer start reading a book on literary criticism, or narrative literature or poetry because I am afraid of falling into a whirlpool of hallucinations and howlers - meaning slips and ignorance, meaning idiocy, let alone the philosophizing of the psychologically disabled, meaning cultured halfwits.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Also, as I read in reality, and in my condition, I started fearing debates with anyone, because I dread the barricades of ideas behind which the debaters hide, and dread those unique cases of ignorance that have become sanctified and untouchable - meaning that ignorance has become a prestige and a façade.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I can no longer visit any art exhibition for fear of wounding my eye with the obtuseness of works panting after a dumb spectator who flutters his eyes in astonishment and has the same opinion about everything.</seg>
<seg id="5"> As in a know-all.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I fear those convoluted means, as in compromised, of art work theft and that swift pursuit of the oil-tasting, gas-perfumed and gas dreaming buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7"> What scares me most are those beautiful natural objects (wooden or rock) that some being washes the pure dust off to dirty it with the addition of his name, so that they become in the opinion of the miserables - as in critics - great works of creativity to be added to the cultural memory, dyspeptic - as in bloated - with rot or  fodder of lies covered in the fungus of wet thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="8"> I am still afraid to write, afraid of the reader for whom the meaning of the written words is what he understands, and not what it was intended to say. I still write a question that whispers in a scream: what reality are we walking towards in one direction, as if we had closed all directions and became equal in silence?</seg>

<seg id="2"> An Attempt To Penetrate the Mentality of Western Youth and Search For Causes of Scientific Excellence II: Beauty and Creativity</seg>
<seg id="3"> Some of you might not agree with me on this point, but I think it is fundamental in finding some sort of striving towards excellence coupled with perfection in the mentality of the western person. This culture manifests itself in their concern with appearances and aesthetic touches to everything, and do not just depend on inventing something without the aesthetic touch.</seg>
<seg id="4"> When you grow up in a beautiful country and a beautiful home, and see beauty and cleanliness everywhere, this reflects on the quality of your production - and I wouldn't be exaggerating if I say on the quantity of this production - to produce a form of love for creativity generated from this culture. A Society That Has No Mercy On Failure.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is difficult to see veiled unemployment or nepotism in the west. This is an involuntary motivation in everyone to improve their production and gain new skills that empower them to work to gain a livelihood and enjoy life which - as I mentioned above - cannot be enjoyed with money which does not come except through serious and hard work and the acquisition of skills.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Thus we find a persistent striving on behalf of workers to be promoted in their work. This is not for nothing but after you have offered something to your work. On the other hand, if you knew that your creativity and increased productivity will not benefit you in anything, you will become frustrated and basically abandon the notion, leaving the promotions to those of nepotism who no sooner climb into a position unsuited to them that they become the pickax which destroys it at work - and Allah only knows. The Scarcity of Social Problems.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Of course the social problems surrounding any person shackles his imagination and creativity, and even his basic abilities to work correctly. Someone will say that the western society is infested with divorce problems, breakups and emotional collapses. I say that this is true, but it does not make the problem bigger and does not follow the person throughout his life as it happens which is when glances follow you and no get-together is free of gossip about you if you have problems.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The nature of our filial cohesion adds to your pressures while the apathy of their society lifts the burden of these problems off you, and this keeps you in good productive style or affects you partially and soon disappears, God knows. To be continued, God willing.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Starve Our Children To Death</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Sami Al Akhras. The lion has imposed his authority and influence, and made a show of his strength, and sank his claws into the heart of the country. He consumed everyone to make himself the king of a barren forest where there is no water or pasture; a forest only saved from its desert-like being by the heaped camps of refugees whose fate preordained that they were carried with their tents to the deserts of Gaza and heaped into the human warehouses built by the UN Relief Agency.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The victorious lion lay down in the middle of the forest, puzzled and wondering what he should do with these mouths, with these injured broken things seeking someone to reassure them and stop the screams of their hungry children.</seg>
<seg id="4"> While the injured lion is lurking and roaring whenever an opportunity arises, expressing his presence and the fact that he still exists, steadfast, standing on his feet.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The mill turns between the victorious lion of Gaza and the injured lion of the Bank, milling everyone down. Decisions and orders follow in succession from both, each looking for his legitimacy violated daily by the occupation with its planes and tanks; a legitimacy baptized by the corpses and blood of the whole people, and a cause that faces the tempest of death and uprooting.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Amidst the legitimacy turmoil, the Prime Minister assigned to run the Emergency Government Salam Fayyad, who is considered an economist who deals with the situation according to a specific economic vision, through which he mimics the emotions of the famished who are victims of hunger and poverty, whose only source for supporting their children are their salaries which were eroded during the past period - the period of democracy and the two headed legitimacy..</seg>
<seg id="7"> Lets get back to the origin of the tale and the beginning of the story. We all confess and admit and confirm that the employment process was carried in accordance with the merit certificate which you get from the party, and with the color of your party flag, since your academic certificate is unimportant and does not indicate aptitude. This is because our universities do not grant scientific degrees  stating your party affiliation, an unforgivable sin on her part, since it bypassed this item on the certificate and forgot that it is more important than the ranking item of the graduating student.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Prime Minister Salam Fayyad issued a decision to end the employment contracts made in the past two years. The reasons for issuing the decision were not explained, or was it issued as a slap across the face of the deposed government? Or as part of a comprehensive reform of the employment situation?</seg>
<seg id="9"> If it was issued as a slap across the face of the deposed government, the slap fell with force on the faces of the children of employees, because the deposed Prime Minister, the ministers, the members of the government, members of sections and of the executive, and the whole government and party retinue have guaranteed and secured pay, including incentives and awards, sundries, travel expenses, risk allowance, mission allowance, leadership allowance, psychological, social and health insurances allowance, clothing allowance, and allowances for rich meals that contain energy and proteins. I guarantee that they were not affected and will sleep through the night content, warm and secure.</seg>
<seg id="10"> On the other hand, if this was employment reform, then all question marks, exclamation marks followed by all other punctuation marks do not suffice to ask, "What reform?"</seg>
<seg id="11"> Is the reform to punish the children of the employees for their fathers' affiliation, or to punish the children because they are children of employees on contracts?</seg>
<seg id="12"> Excuse me, Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. Keep your battles away from the screams of the hungry child and the defeated father and rethink this serious decision. Do not kill our children in the name of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Have mercy on our nation. Have mercy on your families. Have mercy on the children of the future from death, hunger and hatred. Because from the kitchens of those who you intend to punish rise the scents of grilled and fried food, and rise the smells of tasty food to the rhythm of the sea waves. Those who are starving are the children of those employees. Have mercy on those on earth, and the one in heaven will have mercy on you.</seg>

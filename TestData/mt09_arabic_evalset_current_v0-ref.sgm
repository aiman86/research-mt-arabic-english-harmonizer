<seg id="1">The American army announced that a Saudi detainee in the American base at Guantanamo in Cuba died in prison the day before yesterday in an act of "probable suicide," which is the fourth of its kind to be witnessed by this detention camp that raises criticism from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Southern Military Command said in a statement that "The guards found the detainee unconscious, and not breathing in his cell."</seg>
<seg id="3">And it added that "A doctor declared the death of the detainee, after he had tried all the necessary procedures to save him."</seg>
<seg id="4">The statement described the death of the Saudi as a "probable suicide," explaining that an investigation into the incident has been opened.</seg>
<seg id="5">The statement explained that a cultural advisor helped American military personnel to ensure that they observed cultural and religious traditions concerning the man's body.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Southern Command in Miami said in a statement that the body of the deceased will be taken care of, in accordance with the traditions and customs of the religion to which he belongs.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Command added that the Naval Criminal Investigation Service started an investigation into the circumstances of the death.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is worth mentioning that the Guantanamo detention camp, which is administered by the American army in southeast Cuba, has hundreds of detainees in its prisons who are accused of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the face of calls to shut down that prison, the American leadership said that "Detention and interrogation duties in the prison are to continue," explaining that they are "vital to the security of our nation and allies, and they are performed professionally and humanely by men and women of the American army in Guantanamo."</seg>
<seg id="10">The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents some of the detainees, held the American government responsible for the death of the Saudi national.</seg>
<seg id="11">Wells Dixon, the Center's senior attorney for the Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative, said in a statement that "The government of the United States is responsible for the death of the man and must be held accountable."</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that "The military personnel had kept the inmates in constant isolation, and they keep refusing to allow the performance of independent assessment of their psychological conditions."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian businessman Andrei Lugovoi, whom Britain had accused of killing former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, has accused London of the same charge yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Lugovoi denied any involvement in killing the agent, saying that British Intelligence and Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky are the most likely suspects.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a press conference aired live on Russian television yesterday, Lugovoi, who was also an agent for Soviet Intelligence, said: "Britain is making me a scapegoat" in the Litvinenko case.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lugovoi started talking by announcing that the British Intelligence had previously succeeded in recruiting both the late Litvinenko and Berezovsky, the billionaire exiled in London.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that Litvinenko had previously confessed to him about his recruitment and that he had suggested to Berezovsky to cooperate with British Intelligence and hand over documents that he had from the Russian National Security Council, where he had served as a secretary during the rule of former President Boris Yeltsin. This has contributed to facilitating his obtaining the right to political asylum in Britain and, later, British citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lugovoi admitted that he doesn't know for sure who killed his former colleague with the radioactive material of polonium in London last November, but he said that there are probably three suspicious parties. They are British Intelligence, the Mafia, and the billionaire Berezovsky.</seg>
<seg id="7">British authorities refused to reply directly to Lugovoi's statements. A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office just said, "This is a criminal matter and not an intelligence matter. A British citizen was killed in London, and the lives of British citizens and visitors were exposed to danger."</seg>
<seg id="8">Britain's action to grant the right of asylum to Berezovsky stirred the anger of Moscow, which wants him to be handed over to face criminal charges in Russia. Berezovsky emerged as the most notable member of the opposition to Putin after he has admitted that he wants to finance a revolution to change the regime in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="1">Baku -- Reuters: An American official said yesterday that the United States is holding talks with Iraq and Turkey to collect investments aimed at resuming the production of Iraqi gas and exporting it to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2">Matthew Peresa, Deputy Assistant to the American Secretary of State, said in a press conference in Baku that Iraq might be linked to the Baku-Ardrom pipeline between Azerbaijan and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added "The United States is rushing to set up adequate conditions in Iraq for investors willing to pump money into the resumption of the production of gas there."</seg>
<seg id="4">He went on to say that Turkey, Iraq and the United States intend to continue talks on the development of the Iraqi energy sector after holding a previous round of talks last March.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said "There have been no assessments yet of the amount of investment required for gas infrastructure in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it will be necessary to invest in improving the existing infrastructure despite problems related to ensuring its security."</seg>
<seg id="7">Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, informed the conference the day before yesterday, Tuesday, that his country will increase its production of gas from 12 billion cubic meters this year to 16 billion cubic meters in 2008 and will begin a large-scale export to Europe via the Baku-Ardrom pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most of the oil quantities that the pipeline carries will come from the giant Azerbaijani Shakh Deniz field in the Caspian Sea run by the British company BP, the Norwegian company Statoil, the Russian company Lukoil, and the French company Total, and the Iranian and Turkish national companies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pumping Iraqi gas through the pipeline will add a new source for the European gas supplies and will weaken the dominance of the Russian gas company Gazprom whose 25% share of the European market will increase in upcoming contracts.</seg>

<seg id="1">I feel strange about the silence of the Arab media regarding the unwelcomed visit of Hurricane Gonu to the Gulf coasts.</seg>
<seg id="2">I hope that contemplation and meditation are the motivation for that silence, and not amazement or concealment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whatever the reason, I believe that the issue of the visit that the hurricane surprised us with must be taken seriously, because it sends us a message that we must receive and read well. So that we understand its content and lessons before it is too late.</seg>
<seg id="4">First of all, we must thank God that the hurricane was not as strong or brutal as the famous Tsunami and Katrina hurricanes that hit the Asian and American coasts two years ago and caused wide scale destruction and ruin, the impacts of which have not been recovered from till this moment.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is true that the Sultanate of Oman was hurt to some extent, as well as Iran, but that damage is hardly comparable to what the aforementioned hurricanes left behind.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reports and Omani official statements revealed the death of 49 persons, and considered 27 others as missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also destroyed the main roads and bridges that link the eastern districts with Muscat, the capital, and caused floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, it affected crude oil exports from al-Fahal port, stopped the exportation of gas in Sur Port, and caused flooding in a limited number of villages.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the hurricane reached southern Iran, its force had relatively calmed down, and its victims did not exceed 12 dead and 9 missing. The floods caused the displacement of 40 thousand of the residents of four regions in which roads, bridges, and houses were damaged.</seg>
<seg id="10">That the coasts of the other Gulf states remained far from the path of the hurricane, which saved them from its effects, is another blessing that we must praise God for.</seg>

<seg id="9">The main aim of the state of Israel was, and still is, for it to be a peaceful democratic Jewish state where these values coexist in harmony, not in conflict.</seg>
<seg id="10">These same values are what lead us to adhere to the vision of the two states -Israel and Palestine -- which live side by side in security and peace, and to seek to establish real and honest peace with all our neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have no desire to control the lives of the Palestinians</seg>
<seg id="12">The Palestinian terrorists are targeting the Israelis, and we must defend ourselves against them.</seg>
<seg id="13">It must be noted that when the Palestinian terrorists target the Israelis, they also bring tragedy upon the Palestinians, as demonstrated by the latest events in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="14">And while the terrorists claim that they are pushing forward the interests of the Palestinians, they do not succeed except in damaging them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Israel has a vested interest, which we share with moderates throughout the region, in creating a stable, flourishing, and peaceful partner committed to work toward developing the Palestinian state, not in confronting the Jewish state. As we have shown with the implementation of the separation plan from Gaza,</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel is prepared to take painful steps to push this goal forward. But we need to know that our partners are also ready for a historic reconciliation, and that our sacrifices will achieve for us an everlasting peace and security, for we too deserve a political vision.</seg>
<seg id="17">The principle of two states for the two peoples is not a new principle; nevertheless, its deeper meaning is not always appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The establishment of the state of Israel provided the response to historic and national aspirations of the Jewish people, for those of them who lived in the holy lands, and for those who live outside it, for those refugees who fled from the horror of the Nazi holocaust and its woes, and for those who left the Arab or other countries or were expelled from them.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Saudi Railways Organization declared that six international consortia have qualified, in a preliminary pre-bidding stage, to implement the Mecca-Medina electric train project.</seg>
<seg id="2">The project is 500 kilometers long and connects the two holy cities with the city of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is to be noted that the first stage included seven consortia, six of which were nominated for the second stage. Following this stage, the project's documents will be submitted to the qualified consortia, so the consortia can submit their financial offers for the implementation of the project.</seg>
<seg id="4">The steering committee overseeing the project had certified the technical report submitted by a team from the Saudi Rail Organization and its consultants: UBS Bank, the National Commercial Bank, and French railroad company SNCFI.</seg>
<seg id="5">The six consortia include operators, investors, and industrials capable of implementing the project and supervising it in full. The winning consortium will build and operate the project for 50 years, after which it will turn it over to the Saudi government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The organization stipulates the operation of electric trains running at relatively high speeds (exceeding 250 km/hour). The trains will pass through several stops linking the three cities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project will also connect the King Abdulaziz International Airport and the Islamic port of Jeddah with the holy sites.</seg>
<seg id="8">The project, the second branch of the projects to expand the organization, which was ratified by the Supreme Economic Council in Saudi Arabia, is dedicated to transporting passengers. It is expected that more than 15 million passengers will be transported annually.</seg>
<seg id="9">The organization had dedicated the first branch, the Landbridge, to commercial transportation, as it connects the east of the country with the west via the capital, Riyadh, and branches to connect the mining fields in the north and al-Jubail Industrial City with the main route extending from the King Abdulaziz Port in the city of Dammam to the Islamic port of Jeddah on the Red Sea.</seg>

<seg id="1">A female judge at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which is headquartered in The Hague, decided to adjourn the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor to July 3rd in order to settle the problems presented by the defense team.</seg>
<seg id="2">Judge Julia Sebutinde, who presides over the Special Court for Sierra Leone, said that the Taylor trial will resume on July 3rd.</seg>
<seg id="3">She added that "The court orders the Registry in charge of defending Taylor to appoint a lawyer to represent the defendant" until that time, and "to keep the members of the previous defense team" to assist in this task.</seg>
<seg id="4">Taylor, who is accused of committing atrocities against civilians in Sierra Leone in the 90s, said on June 4th, in a message read by his lawyer at the beginning of the trial, that his client had decided to assume his own defense.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, documents issued by the Special Court for Sierra Leone dated June 21st asserted that Taylor "did not intend to defend himself alone," and that he is looking for a good defense team.</seg>
<seg id="6">Taylor had been demanding more time and means to find a lawyer capable of defending his interests in this very complicated case.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taylor, 59 years old, has been detained at The Hague for almost a year and faces 11 charges of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is accused of supporting the rebels who tortured civilians in Sierra Leone in the 90s, in a conflict that led to the death of 120,000 people and the disfigurement of thousands.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is the first former African president to appear before an international court.</seg>
<seg id="10">The general prosecution says that Taylor supported the rebels who committed crimes during the civil war in Liberia's neighboring state of Sierra Leone.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two more states, Guinea and The Comoros, have joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD) during the opening session of its ninth summit in the Libyan city of Surt on Saturday, thereby raising the number of its members to 25 states.</seg>
<seg id="3">The summit was opened by the current president of the Community, the Libyan Leader Muammar al-Qadhafi, in the presence of 14 heads of states and ten prime ministers and ministers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Al-Qadhafi welcomed the highly distinguished turnout that reflects the importance that the member states give to the Community of Sahel-Saharan States, as he pointed to the increased importance of this organization in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thirteen heads of states members of the community, which are Sudan, Chad, Somalia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Central Africa, Togo, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea Bissau, came to Surt (450 km east of Tripoli).</seg>
<seg id="6">The summit was also attended by the president of the Comoros Ahmad Abdullah Sambi on the occasion of the Union of the Comoros joining the Community, unlike the Guinean President, Lansana Conte, who did not attend in person and delegated his Prime Minister, Lansana Kouyate, to represent him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The remainder of the states were represented by their prime ministers or foreign ministers. President Hosni Mubarak was absent from the summit and was represented by the minister of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ninth summit of the Community, the majority of whose members are among the poorest countries in the world, will discuss food security, managing natural resources, and the establishment of a free exchange zone, according to the agenda.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Senegalese will elect their representatives on Sunday, three months after reelecting their President Abdoulaye Wade, in legislative elections boycotted by the most prominent opposition parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a boycott unprecedented in the history of Senegal, and the rate of participation in these elections will show its extent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Babacar Gueye, head of a coalition of 11 civil society organizations believes that "the largest bet in these elections, at the political level, is on the rate of participation.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the rate is high, the authorities will gloat over the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="6">But if the rate is low, then the opposition will consider that it has won in the display of power against the government."</seg>
<seg id="7">He added, "If the rate is low, President Wade could move towards expanding the popular base of his rule by including opposition parties in the government so that he will not face legitimacy problems."</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, the Sopi Coalition (which means "Change" in the Wolof language, the most common in the country), which consists of the Senegalese Democratic Party headed by Wade and his allies, is confident about winning the legislative elections, in which 17 parties and coalitions will participate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The election campaign, which did not get much attention from the voters, ended on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Leading opposition personalities, among whom in particular are former Prime Ministers Idrissa Seck, Moustapha Niasse, and Ousmane Tanor Dieng who came in second, fourth and third, respectively in the presidential elections, objected to President's Wade victory, who garnered 55.9% of the votes in the first round of the presidential elections on February 25.</seg>
<seg id="11">They decided to boycott the legislative elections because of the absence of dialogue, especially regarding the review of the electoral lists, and they have called for guarantees with regard to transparency in the elections, but in vain.</seg>
<seg id="12">In an effort to push the opposition leaders, who are part of the Sigil Senegal Front coalition (for the revival of Senegal) which consists of 17 parties, to amend their boycott position, the civil society members and many foreign dignitaries have repeatedly tried to mediate between the authorities and the opposition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amman 6-6-2007 (AFP) -- Jordanian authorities in the past months have uncovered some 81 illegal cases of human organ trafficking in Jordan, after which a number of those involved in the case were arrested, according to a spokesman for the committee of encouraging the transfer and transplant of human organs.</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the newspaper "Jordan Times" quoted Mo'men al-Hadidi, the committee's rapporteur, as saying that "the authorities have discovered 81 cases of organ trafficking during the past few months," adding that a number of Jordanians were arrested in May for urging people to sell their kidneys to clients outside Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="3">He said that "These people work on commission and target the poor. They convince them to sell their kidneys and they facilitate their travel outside the country to a third state where the operations take place."</seg>
<seg id="4">He added that "Most of the donors were between the ages of 20 and 40 years and were tempted by the thought of getting cash quickly," pointing out that one kidney sells for three thousand dollars.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al-Hadidi said that most of those who sold their kidneys were among the poor and the unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is noted that organ transplant operations are forbidden in Jordan, and those who violate the law face five years of imprisonment and payment of a fine of about twenty thousand dinars (28 thousand dollars).</seg>
<seg id="7">The Jordanian Health Minister, Saad al-Kharabsheh, had announced in May the formation of a high national committee to put an end to the phenomenon of human organ trafficking and to encourage Jordanians to donate their organs after death.</seg>
<seg id="8">Al-Hadidi said that "Some 800 people die every year as a result of traffic accidents in Jordan. We have to encourage the relatives of these victims to donate the organs of their beloved ones, and this way we could limit the demand."</seg>

<seg id="4">The spokesman said, "We are dealing with people who may be dangerous, as they are throwing stones." He noted that "The police used water canons to push them away from the barrier, which they had approached."</seg>
<seg id="5">He added, "The total number of demonstrators is about 9,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="6">An official of the G8-Block, an anti-globalization organization, said that police used tear gas along with water cannons to disperse the demonstrators, a matter not confirmed by the police.</seg>
<seg id="7">The demonstration resulted in the closure of a police checkpoint after the demonstrators blocked a number of roads near the barrier, which is about 12 km long, in addition to blocking the coastal railway that is used to transport journalists from the media center located in Kuhlungsborn, several hundred meters from Heiligendamm.</seg>
<seg id="8">Representatives of the media had to board German navy boats that transported them to the location of the summit, while a number of helicopters surveyed the area from the air.</seg>
<seg id="9">The German judiciary prevented gatherings near the security barrier that isolated Heiligendamm from the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The police said that some 30 activities were due to be held, especially around the Rostock-Laage Airport, where heads of state and heads of government are expected to arrive during the day.</seg>

<seg id="4">He added that it is not currently suggested that Kouchner would pay a visit to Darfur, in western Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="5">The French minister made the issue of Darfur "his priority" since his appointment less than three weeks ago, but he seemed to have backed down on Wednesday from the idea of establishing a "humanitarian passage" from Chad to help the civilians.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kouchner, who supports the "intervention for humanitarian reasons" principle, admitted on Wednesday that he is not "totally sure" of the possibility of establishing a humanitarian passage from Chad, as he pointed out that the passage, whose establishment is being discussed, would at any rate not exceed an "air" bridge.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Thursday, Kouchner will start an African tour that will lead him on his first stop to Mali, where he will attend the inauguration of the Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure on Friday, and he will take advantage of his presence in Bamako to meet a number of African presidents.</seg>

<seg id="4">The two missiles seem to be of the surface to sea or sea to sea type and have a range of 100 kilometers.</seg>

<seg id="7">He added, "North Korea should focus on nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula and fulfil its obligations contained in the agreement of February 13" on starting the nuclear weapon disarmament of North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="8">He concluded, "This type of behavior is not constructive."</seg>
<seg id="9">On May 25, North Korea launched short-range missiles opposite its coasts, apparently within the framework of routine tests that did not expose its northern neighbor to direct danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">That took place during a period of tension between North Korea and Japan, which imposed economic sanctions on Pyongyang after a nuclear test that it had conducted on October 9, 2006.

<seg id="2">The request was made by MPs Muslim Al-Barrak, Adel Al-Sarawi, and Abdallah Al-Roumi, who represent different opposition blocs and call for firing the minister, who is a member of the Kuwaiti ruling family.</seg>

<seg id="4">If the Oil Minister loses the parliamentary vote of confidence, he will automatically be regarded as having resigned. One of the MPs who submitted the request for questioning said, "We reject allowing the minister to remain in his post because we consider that allowing Sheikh Ali to remain represents a danger to the vital oil sector."</seg>
<seg id="5">In press statements, Sheikh Ali praised the former Oil Minister Sheikh Ali Al-Khalifa Al-Sabah, even though this minister has been accused by the government in a corruption case, which he completely denies.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Conservative Party spokesman for foreign affairs, William Hague, rejected this excuse.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "It is not true that the morale of our forces would decrease or that our enemies would get a boost if we sought to find out where we went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="7">He added, "In a democratic society, studying failure and success is an indication of strength, not weakness."</seg>
<seg id="8">The memorandum had called for interrogating those who were at the helm of political decision making and the military officials before the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="5">American diplomats had presented to the Program last Thursday the results of an investigation by the State Department that confirms that the Pyongyang regime has transferred some three million dollars of the aid, which is specially allocated for development, to buy property in France, Britain, and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="6">The American mission to the United Nations accused North Korea last January of engaging since 1998 in "systematic embezzlement" of the aid that is allocated for development, in collusion with the United Nations Development Program.</seg>
<seg id="7">A preliminary report on the audit of the accounts of the activities of United Nations agencies in North Korea, which was published last week, said that it did not find any element that would allow the confirmation of these American accusations. But the report did reveal "some practices (in North Korea) that are different from those implemented in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="8">The United Nations said in a statement that these practices show the "difficulties" that United Nations agencies face in their activities in North Korea, especially in areas of "independent hiring from the local market and the deals that are made in foreign currency and resulting in local development projects."</seg>

<seg id="1">Cairo 6-15-2007 (AFP) -- The Arab foreign ministers, who started an emergency meeting at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo this Friday evening to discuss the Palestinian situation, are heading towards announcing their support for the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="2">Meanwhile, the Head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement, Khaled Mashal, called upon them to remain neutral so that they do not "become part of the problem, but part of the solution."</seg>
<seg id="3">The meeting, in which at least 14 foreign ministers participated, was preceded by a number of bilateral meetings held by Secretary-General of the Arab League Amr Moussa with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faysal, Head of the Palestinian delegation to the leadership meeting of Fatah Azzam al-Ahmad (Deputy Prime Minister in the government that was disbanded), and Lebanese Minister of Culture and acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Tareq Mitri.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, has also held discussions with his Saudi and Jordanian counterparts, Prince Saud al-Faysal and Abdul Ilah al-Khatib, and with the Lebanese minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">The spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, Ala al-Hadidi, said that the three ministers "agreed" with Aboul Gheit on "the need to respect the legitimate and constitutional institutions, and condemn every action that is outside the frame of legitimacy, or overturn it for the sake of private or regional objectives."</seg>
<seg id="6">The Arab ministers will be announcing their condemnation of Hamas and their support for the position of the Palestinian President, who dismissed yesterday the government that is headed by Hamas and appointed the former Finance Minister, Salam Fayyad, on Friday to form an emergency government.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the dismissal decree of Ismail Haniyeh's government, Abbas acknowledged yesterday, Thursday, that the Hamas movement had made a coup against the legitimate institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Egypt had been mediating for solving disputes between the movements of Fatah and Hamas, but it decided today to withdraw its security mission resident in Gaza after Hamas announced its control over the Strip, in an indication of its new position towards the movement.</seg>

<seg id="3">Olmert, who will arrive Sunday in the United States on his thirteenth visit in 13 months, will meet in New York with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon prior to his meeting with Bush, and with the candidates for the American presidency and the leaders of the American Jews.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spokeswoman for Olmert, Miri Eisen, told Agence France Presse that "the Palestinian issue will be at the core of the discussions and what happened this week in the Gaza Strip indicates that this is an urgent matter."</seg>
<seg id="5">She added that "Bush and Olmert will discuss ways to support Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas."</seg>
<seg id="6">A key Israeli official, who asked that his name not be revealed, said, "We had hesitated about the two state solution (Israel and Palestine), but it seems to us that it is essential to move forward in light of the issues currently presented."</seg>
<seg id="7">A source close to the Israeli government said that the American administration seems unable to take further action on the Palestinian issue and has no choice but to assist Abbas "without knowing how, given the prevailing mess."</seg>
<seg id="8">And after Abbas declared the dissolving of the Palestinian National Unity government and the appointment of its Finance Minister, Salam Fayyad, on Friday to form an emergency government, Israel announced its readiness to resume "full cooperation" with the new government, including the financial level, if it recognized the Jewish State.</seg>

<seg id="2">The state of alert was announced within the ranks of the Lebanese army and the International Emergency Force (UNIFIL) in south Lebanon on Monday, after two rockets were launched from Lebanese territory against north Israel for the first time in ten months.</seg>
<seg id="3">A correspondent of Agence France Presse said that armored vehicles belonging to the army and UNIFIL patrolled the road adjacent to the Israeli borders, while the army and the police established checkpoints in the border area.</seg>
<seg id="4">Two rockets fell Sunday afternoon on the Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese border, which resulted in slight damage without casualties.</seg>
<seg id="5">The launching of the two rockets, in the first operation of this sort since the war that took place between the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and the Israeli army in July and August 2006, has resulted in the escalation of tension in Lebanon at a time when it is witnessing a wave of assaults, and heavy battles are taking place between the army and the fighters of the Fatah al-Islam group in Nahr el-Bared camp for Palestinian refugees in the north.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israel had accused an unspecified Palestinian organization of launching the two rockets, while Hezbollah denied any relation to the operation and the Lebanese government pledged to prosecute those responsible.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lebanese Prime Minister, Fuad Siniora, announced that "The state, through all of its security apparatuses, will spare no effort in uncovering those who are behind this incident, which aims at attempting to shake stability" in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="8">UNIFIL regarded that launching the two rockets forms "a serious hole in the truce" that has continued since last summer as per Resolution 1701 issued by the Security Council, calling upon all parties to calm.</seg>
<seg id="9">The aforementioned international resolution had put an end to the military conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, and according to which the consolidated UNIFIL force and the Lebanese army were deployed in south Lebanon after Hezbollah fighters had been controlling it.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, spoke of the size of the stakes of this summit in an interview with the newspaper "Die Welt," saying, "I do not at all approve the idea of Europe moving at two speeds (...), but if we could not move forward together, this idea would be the only solution to exit this deadlock."</seg>
<seg id="4">By this, he expressed the great discontent that many of the "old Europeans" feel towards the paralysis in the European institutions that has been occuring for two years.</seg>
<seg id="5">He regarded that the chances of reaching or not reaching an agreement are equal,</seg>
<seg id="6">warning that "any enlargement of the Union is not possible without ratifying a new constitution."</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, the new French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, who supported the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in her efforts to reach a smaller constitution that retrieves the core of the constitution rejected by the French and the Dutch, has expressed his caution with regard to the results of this summit that could last until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">He told the French private television station "TF1," "We will try to reach a settlement (...), and I cannot imagine that we would not reach that."</seg>

<seg id="2">The President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski, who is the twin brother of Jaroslaw, is participating in the Brussels summit.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a morning meeting between the Polish President and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Polish diplomats announced that no progress was made with regard to the issue of the described majority voting system that is threatening to sweep away the whole European treaty.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Jaroslaw Kaczynski gave a different impression from Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Polish Prime Minister told the reporters, "Some of our suggestions were accepted, at least by the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="6">The difference between Poland and Germany is not very big anymore. There are problems with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="7">Poland acknowledges that the described majority voting system, which the constitutional convention stipulates, gives a lot of weight to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The treaty states that the decisions are to be made by a 55% majority of the votes of the member states, provided that these countries represent 65% of the European Union population.</seg>
<seg id="9">Instead of this system, Poland suggested the "square root" formula to be adopted in order to calculate the number of residents of each of the Union states, as it regarded this formula to be more fair. Jaroslaw Kaczynski said, "What we simply need is moderation.</seg>

<seg id="5">This new text, which mentions section seven of the United Nations Charter (used in case international peace and security are threatened), calls upon the parties to "abstain from making any one-sided announcements with regard to the final status of Kosovo during this period." But Russia rejected it because it objects to an "automatic" independence of Kosovo if, at the end of the 120 days, a deal was not reached on the issue of the province's situation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian Ambassador, Vitaliy Churkin, said that the new text "does not allow nearing an acceptable agreement," assuming that "no real negotiations between the parties could be held if the Ahtisaari plan is to be automatically implemented at the end of the 120 days."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sarkozy said in a speech at Le Bourget exhibition for the aviation and space industries near Paris that "European defense budgets as a whole, remaining much lower than the U.S. budget, can no longer bear the implications of five surface to air missile programs, three fighter aircraft programs, six attack submarine programs and more than twenty armored vehicle programs."</seg>

<seg id="10">Iran repeated its demand for the release of its diplomats who are being held by the United States, but the United States insisted that they are accused of supporting the fighters of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="11">In statements to journalists, Motaki said that Iran intends to send a letter to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to protest what he described as clear discrimination by the Security Council for the delay in putting the crisis of the Iranian prisoners on its agenda.</seg>
<seg id="12">Despite his strongly worded statements, Motaki stressed his country's readiness to continue its cooperation with the United States with regard to efforts to end acts of violence in Iraq. He explained that Iran's policy of supporting the Iraqi people and government is a fixed policy that will not be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said that if the United States still insists on solving the crisis of which it was a part, the Iranian government will continue its work according to the requests of the Iraqi government regarding the Iranian-American dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, regarding the Iranian nuclear issue, the U.S. State Department confirmed yesterday that the next few weeks will witness intensive international discussions with regard to the possibility of imposing further sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sean McCormack said that the Security Council and the capitals of the relevant countries will start a series of discussions in response to Iran's refusal to comply with the Security Council resolutions to stop its uranium enrichment activities.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Vienna, Greg Schulte, the United States representative to the International Agency Board of Governors -- which began meetings the day before yesterday that will last for a week -- said that meetings on the second day focused on the issues of Iran's expansion of the scope of enrichment activities, and its simultaneous position of not allowing the agency's inspectors to look into the various details of its nuclear program, as this is a source of concern for the international community.</seg>

<seg id="1">Current events in the Palestinian territories confirm that Israel is the only beneficiary of the current situation that has resulted from Hamas taking control of the headquarters of the security apparatuses in Gaza Strip, and of the ensuing decisions by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), which have led to the emergence of two struggling entities, neither of which can impose its control over the other due to the nonexistence of a geographical connection between the two. In addition, Israel does not allow either one of the two forces to finish off the other, which is what Israel is expected to do since it serves its strategic interests and achieves its old dream.</seg>
<seg id="2">If we went back a little bit, specifically to December 18, 2005, we would easily find the truth in this idea. In the session that was held by the Israeli cabinet on that day, during a presentation of what is called intelligence monitoring, Aharon Ze'evi Farkash, Head of Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate at the time, said</seg>
<seg id="3">that the Gaza Strip could turn into Hamastan and the West Bank into Fatahstan.</seg>
<seg id="4">He added, "We can use whatever expressions we want to about Abu Mazen and his intention to do something, but in the end, there will be no results coming from him."</seg>
<seg id="5">Farkash explained what he meant, "There are possibilities that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will turn into two geographically separated entities in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="6">Certainly Israel has in one way or the other helped to make the aforementioned idea a tangible reality by inflaming the struggle between the Fatah and Hamas movements, whether directly or indirectly, because this serves its interests regardless of the faction that controls the situation in Gaza at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="3">The source added that the Quartet meeting in Jerusalem is expected to make decisions on logistical matters, make final arrangements, and publish this announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The British newspaper added that America and the United Nations strongly supported this appointment while other parties opposed it.

<seg id="5">In Berlin, sources at the German Foreign Ministry revealed that Germany opposes the appointment of Tony Blair as the new delegate to the International Quartet on the Middle East; however, the German government is trying to avoid a conflict with the United States on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Der Spiegel magazine noted in its issue yesterday that Germany and Europe are unhappy about the agreement between the United States and Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, to nominate the British prime minister without consulting with Germany and without notifying the German Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, even though consultations among members of the International Quartet on developments in the Middle East took place a few days ago.</seg>

The meeting will be attended by Mr. Safwat Al-Sharif, Secretary General of the Party; the Party's Secretariat Commission; members of the Policies Council; the Minister of Housing; and a number of ministers and officials.</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr. Jamal Mubarak is presenting a detailed report on the activities of the Policies Secretariat and its meetings and sessions in the past period, in addition to presenting the most important features of the great success achieved by the Party in the semi-renewal elections of the Shura Council.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineer Ahmed El-Maghrabi, Minister of Housing, Facilities and Constructional Development, said that the strategy does not only mean construction planning for the Greater Cairo District, but aims to achieve a community vision for the district.</seg>
<seg id="4">Is the purpose that the capital should be a cultural or historic center, should it be the financial center for the Middle East and Europe, or should it be the most famous city in terms of quality of life and environment?</seg>
<seg id="5">On this basis, and when the main characteristic of the capital are identified, the construction planning will proceed to be in harmony with the requirements of any vision that is agreed upon.</seg>
<seg id="6">El-Maghrabi explained that several alternatives to the projects that will be implemented by all bodies of the state will be presented, which will be coordinated with one another.</seg>

<seg id="2">In this context, the issue of intellectual and organizational reevaluations that the Egyptian Jihad organization is about to announce these days, along with the previous wider and deeper reviews that were initated by the Islamic group 10 years ago, raises</seg>
<seg id="3">real questions about its future and its influence on the phenomenon of religious violence in Egypt and in the world, which, along with its activists, was given the term "jihadist."</seg>
<seg id="4">The main question around which expectations and fears are circulating with regard to the future is: will these reevaluations lead to stopping or reducing the practice of religious violence, or terror, from which Egypt has suffered for many years and which the world is still suffering from? Or will their influence be limited and this suffering will continue?</seg>
<seg id="5">In truth, the answer to this question -- expectation lies partly within the question itself, since the distinction between the future of this phenomenon of violence in Egypt and outside Egypt, is considered the first entry to answer and expectation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reevaluations that the Islamic group started in Egypt, when it announced its initiative to halt the violence 10 years ago on July 5, 1997, have in fact resulted in the total cessation of all activities and manifestations of religious violence in this country by the group throughout this period without any exception since the West Bank massacre in Luxor, which was committed on November 17, 1997 by members of the Group who were not aware of their leadership's initiative and their decision to stop the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The importance of these 10 years of complete halting of violence is that they represent more than one third of the age of the Group, which is three decades. That is not a short period that some may regard as an exception in a long history, or a short ceasefire that will end soon.</seg>

<seg id="3">Mr. al-Ayadi said that the "Carthage Statement" will be issued by the symposium, which the participating associations and organizations will address to the Federation Chair in order to present it at the India Conference next November.</seg>
<seg id="4">For her part, Ms. Claudia Morrell, Director of the Center for Women and Information Technology at the University of Maryland in the United States, noted the honor bestowed upon her as a participant in the Tunisia Symposium.</seg>
<seg id="5">She stated that she met with many Tunisian women and female engineers whom she considered fortunate not to suffer from sexual discrimination and segregation.</seg>
<seg id="6">She added that the goal of this symposium is the same as the goal of the organization that she presides, which is to encourage the role of women in the field of engineering and technology.</seg>
<seg id="7">In turn, Mr. Tony Marjoram, UNESCO representative, stated that among the objectives of his organization are justice and equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="8">He added that women's participation is very important for justice and equality between them and men, and that women's participation in the engineering sector currently exceeds their number during the 80s and 90s.

<seg id="9">He noted the need to identify the reasons young people, especially young women, turn away from engineering specializations, adding that the UNESCO is concerned with this issue.</seg>

<seg id="1">American President George Bush announced a new series of economic sanctions against Iran on May 24th, following a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency published the day before on the increase in uranium enrichment and the lack of Tehran's cooperation with the international organization.</seg>
<seg id="2">This announcement was timed with the declaration by his ambassador to the United Nations on the same day that there were disagreements within the Security Council that prevented the implementation of previous resolutions on boycotting Iran.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact is that the US sanctions against Iran date back to the early 80s when American oil companies were banned from the oil business there, followed by a congressional legislation in 1996, the "Iran and Libya Economic Sanctions Act," which imposed sanctions on foreign (non-American) companies that invest more than 20 million dollars annually in Iran's oil industry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Libya was exempted from these sanctions after the settlement of the dispute over the bombing of the American plane over Lockerbie in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is clear that the United States has not succeeded so far in undermining the Iranian oil industry, as happened with Iraq in the 90s of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, what has been accomplished is the use of constant pressure to limit the natural growth of this industry and return it to its prior levels before the 1979 Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="7">As is known, Iranian oil production attained a capacity of about 6 million barrels a day at the end of the Shah's reign, dropped during the Iraq-Iran War to about 2.6 million barrels a day and has now risen to 4 million barrels a day,</seg>
<seg id="8">while export capacity remained unchanged for several years; it amounts to about 2.5 million barrels a day. In the previous Iranian fiscal year, total oil proceeds were about 54 billion dollars.</seg>

It noted the criticism addressed against him by Israeli diplomats in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2">The station mentioned that Mofaz notified Rice that "Hezbollah" has returned to South Lebanon to the same pre-war level, but without its men appearing along the borders.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added, according to the station, that the United Nations peacekeeping forces and the Lebanese Army are doing nothing to disarm "Hezbollah."</seg>
<seg id="4">The station cited sources in the Israeli Embassy as saying that diplomats at the embassy are criticizing Mofaz for ruling out a military attack against Iran, and for his statement that the possibilities to influence Iran by diplomatic means have not been exhausted yet.</seg>
<seg id="5">The same sources said that such statements by one of the senior Israeli Ministers hinders Israel's efforts at keeping all options open, including undertaking a military operation.</seg>
<seg id="6">And under the headline "Beersheba Within Range of Hezbollah," a report published by the daily "Yedioth Ahronoth" says that Mofaz informed Rice that after the second Lebanese war, Syria and Iran smuggled missiles to "Hezbollah" that could reach population centers in central Israel and parts of its south.</seg>
<seg id="7">It added that Mofaz was quoting "reliable" intelligence information obtained by Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">A missile expert said that Mofaz was referring to the Iranian-made "Fateh-110" missile, whose warhead weighs half a ton and whose range reaches 250 kilometers. That is, it can reach from South Lebanon the city of Beersheba in the Negev desert in the South of Israel.</seg>

<seg id="2">Khoja's contacts with all the parties came as part of an effort to urge them to reach an agreement on a memorandum of understanding, especially since Saudi Arabia remains the country most capable of being receptive to everyone, backed this time by French Ambassador, Bernard Emie and Iranian Ambassador, Mohammad Reza Shibani,</seg>
<seg id="3">in addition to the US Ambassador, Jeffrey Feltman, who has not ceased his contacts with the opposition figures led by National Assembly Speaker, Nabih Berri and the leader of the "Free Patriotic Movement," General Michel Aoun.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Khoja is careful to confirm, as is reported by his visitors, that he is not carrying a political initiative on behalf of his country, and that all that matters to him that the parties reach an agreement to accelerate the birth of a national unity government from the womb of the current government.</seg>
<seg id="5">He also does not engage in a contest with this or that party as much as he addresses one message to everyone in which he calls on them to assist the Arab and international efforts supporting Lebanese-Lebanese agreement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz yesterday confirmed that secret indirect contacts have taken place with Damascus, with the aim of probing Syria's peaceful intentions.</seg>
<seg id="2">He told Israeli radio, "There were contacts via secret channels, and so far there has been no Syrian reaction."</seg>
<seg id="3">But he did not disclose the substance of these contacts or the way they proceeded.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mofaz, a former Defense Minister and Army Commander, and a member of the Israeli security mini-cabinet, commented on information published the day before yesterday by the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot, which wrote that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently notified Syria by secret messages that he is prepared to resume discussions with it and withdraw from the Golan Heights, which Israel occupied in 1967 and annexed in 1981, in exchange for peace.</seg>
<seg id="5">It said that Olmert said in one of his messages, "I realize that any peace agreement with Syria will obligate me to return the Golan Heights to Syrian sovereignty, and I am prepared to shoulder my responsibilities in order to establish peace between us."</seg>
<seg id="6">It added that these messages were sent to President Bashar al-Asad through Turkish and German officials.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mofaz said, "After the recent prevailing tension (between the two sides) and the latest Syrian declarations in support of peace, I believed,</seg>
<seg id="8">and I believe today, that the secret channels allow a probing of intentions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He added, "I want to remind you that previous peace agreements began with contacts through secret channels," in reference to the peace treaty with Egypt (1979).</seg>
<seg id="10">Nevertheless, he noted the "duality" in the position of "the Syrians who on one hand, express their desire to resume dialogue, but on the other hand, do not respond to messages sent to them in this regard."</seg>

<seg id="1">In a development related to the escalating intensity of conflicts between the institution of the Turkish army and the government led by the (Islamic) Justice and Development Party, against the backdrop of the crisis of the candidacy for the post of President of the Republic, the Turkish government moved to dismiss its country's envoy to the joint committee on anti-terrorism (with the United States), retired General Adib Basar.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the same time, the government announced that it has decided to appoint the diplomat Rifat Agh Gunay, a high-ranking official from the Turkish Foreign Ministry, to the same committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">It should be noted that this committee, which specializes in the activities of the Kurdistan Workers Party outside the Turkish borders, was established after an American suggestion more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the time, Washington explained that the purpose of establishing the committee was to help Ankara hunt down the terrorist groups which aim at undermining it. But individuals close to the political circle in Ankara said that the real objective was to convince Ankara not to invade Iraqi Kurdistan to hunt down Workers Party fighters who take shelter in the rugged mountainous regions on the Iraqi-Iranian border for their activities, but instead to search for non-military solutions in cooperation with the Iraqis and the Kurdish leaders in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="5">It should be noted that Ankara at the time issued a series of threats about invading Iraqi Kurdistan to hunt down the Workers Party fighters, but the Kurdish leadership in Iraq responded that it would not stand idle in the face of any Turkish military invasion, but rather would consider it an act of occupation and would call on the Kurds to resist it with arms.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since Iraqi Kurdistan constitutes the only peaceful area in a troubled Iraq, the United States was quick to convince Ankara to drop the military threats and resort to peaceful solutions based on the principle of cooperation with the Kurds of Iraq, in an effort to dislodge the fighters from their strongholds and put an end to their armed operations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Calm settled over the Gaza Strip after six days of violent battles between partisans of the Fatah and Hamas movements that resulted in at least 116 dead and 550 wounded, and ended with Hamas announcing its complete control over Gaza. This prompted the international community, represented by the International Quartet, to declare full support for President Mahmoud Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite this, Washington denied any intention to cut off emergency assistance from the Gaza Strip or "to treat Gaza and the West Bank differently," and it announced that it is looking into a series of options to deal with the recent developments, including boosting Abbas by making progress on the peace process track and improving conditions in the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="3">As for the Israeli government, it opted for "waiting, monitoring and mobilizing," even if the Gaza incidents speeded up its approval of the appointment of Ehud Barak as Minister of Defense, while the Chief of the Political Bureau of Hamas, Khaled Meshaal, placed "principal responsibility" for the crisis between Fatah and Hamas on the international community.</seg>
<seg id="4">Parallel to this, the Palestinian president assigned Finance Minister Salam Fayyad the task of forming an "emergency government" after announcing the dissolution of the unity government. This is an assignment that Hamas deemed unconstitutional and "contrary to all the laws."</seg>

<seg id="1">An oil specialist and expert has ruled out the White House agreeing to adopt a draft project voted for in Congress (the Senate and House of Representatives), to prosecute OPEC countries in American courts on charges of manipulating prices.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a conversation with Al-Hayat, the Emirati expert, Ayman Saif, said, "The accusation of price manipulating, which was submitted by Democrat Herb Kohl and Republican Arlen Specter and was approved by the US Senate, is not only directed against the countries of the organization, but against all oil producers in the world."</seg>
<seg id="3">He added, "But because the other countries outside OPEC are not bound by a common tie, the accusation was leveled against them as an association of a large number of producers."</seg>
<seg id="4">Saif does not believe that U.S. President George W. Bush will approve this law because it harms America's interests and opens the door for other countries to treat their products similarly. It also does not respect the sovereignty and independence of the countries, and it is a dangerous precedent that never happened before.</seg>
<seg id="5">Saif said that "demanding such a law is not new. It began the first time in 1978 when a labor group filed a lawsuit against OPEC under the antitrust law, but a US Appeals Court rejected the lawsuit in 1981 on the grounds that the members of the organization enjoy immunity against judicial lawsuits because their decisions are decisions of sovereign states. Then there was the second attempt in 2005, but the lawsuit was dropped before it was voted on."</seg>
<seg id="6">Saif believes that "those who should be prosecuted are the big oil companies (most of which are American) because of their monopoly on the technology of exploration and refining.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, the competitors in the world's oil markets are the ones raising prices and not the producing countries, because rising prices are not the result of a drop in supply, but rather of the inability of the refineries in America to produce enough to meet the need of the market there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Legal sources said that the Egyptian public prosecutor referred seven people, including a member of the People's Assembly, to the Criminal Court yesterday for being involved in importing blood bags that violate specifications of the Ministry of Health and Population.</seg>
<seg id="2">A source said that the prosecutor charged the seven with profiteering and cheating in importing the blood bags. Among them was People's Assembly member Hani Sorour, who owns the company that imported the bags, and its board chairman.</seg>
<seg id="3">The source added that the others are four company officials including Sorour's sister who occupies a position as member of the board, and two officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.</seg>
<seg id="4">The People's Assembly agreed in January to lift the parliamentary immunity off Sorour.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sorour and the other six were brought to an investigation conducted by the High Public Financial Prosecutor regarding the discovery of thousands of blood bags which do not conform to regulations, and were imported from the company to warehouses belonging to the Ministry of Health and Population, after complaints were sent to monitoring groups from a number of public hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="6">The prosecutor said in the referral decision that the officials at the Ministry of Health received blood (packages) without scientific inspections, and were satisfied with the external inspection.</seg>
<seg id="7">It added that defects were discovered in the blood bags that cause the donors to faint due to an increase in their average blood flow over the natural average, the occurrence of blood clots, and the explosion of the packages during the separation of the blood constituents.</seg>

<seg id="1">The daily British newspaper, The Guardian, and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) television station surprised the whole world by publishing details of the bribes and commissions that were received by Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, the former Saudi Ambassador in Washington and the Secretary General of the Saudi National Council as part of the Al Yamamah weapon deal that the Saudi government purchased from Britain that amounted to 43 billion pounds sterling, which is around 80 billion dollars, and included the purchase of Tornado and Hawk aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2">There are many details about how these commissions and bribes were paid, and they are becoming known, and maybe will become clearer in sound and picture when the BBC broadcasts its televised program that includes the results of the investigation and interviews in order to know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is unknown, at least to the Arab reader, is which party stands behind this revelation and the leaking of the information to the media, and the reasons that led to that.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before answering this question we have to go back a little bit, and especially to the personal intervention of the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and his halt to the investigations into the deal and its commissions, that were being conducted by an independent judiciary committee, after the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia threatened to cut off its relationships with Britain, stop its cooperation in the war on terror, and withdraw from a new weapon deal that it was planning to purchase from Britain, which totaled 70 billion dollars and included modern Eurofighter planes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tony Blair, who will leave his position in approximately two weeks, said that he bears responsibility for making this decision, because continuing the investigation will lead to revealing findings that threaten British national security and cause harm to its relationships with an allied country that has participated effectively in the war on terror and the war in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="4">The source revealed that the fugitives had 57 automatic rifles and 20 RPG missile launchers with them.</seg>

<seg id="1">The edition of the Observer newspaper that was issued yesterday, Sunday, revealed that Tony Blair agreed to involve British troops in the Iraq war while he had full knowledge that Washington did not make the necessary preparations for the post-war period and rebuilding operations in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2">The newspaper said that the British Prime Minister's top aides and close friends confirmed that Blair had frequently shown his concern to the White House regarding this issue but to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also agreed to involve British troops in the Iraq war despite the fact that President George Bush announced personally that Britain could help in other ways.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper pointed out that this disclosure, which came in a documentary that will be aired by Channel 4 Television next Saturday in two episodes, will raise many questions about the guarantees that Blair gave to the British public, at the outbreak of the war in March 2003, that he was satisfied with planning for the post-war period in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="5">It quoted Peter Mandelson, a former minister in Blair's government, as saying in the show that the prime minister (Blair) was aware that preparations for the post-war period were not adequate, but he was not able to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="6">For his part, Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former Special Representative to Iraq, said that Blair was in a state of desperation... and that he used to pull his hair because of some of the shortcomings and defects.</seg>
<seg id="7">Greenstock stressed that the failure to make the necessary preparations led to the rapid deterioration of the situation in Iraq.

<seg id="2">It would not be sensible for these countries to provide their obedience and swear an oath to America on this obedience, and do by heart all the tasks that are aligned with American demands.</seg>

<seg id="5">In addition to its nuclear program, Iran has not forgotten, and in repeated statements, the dangers of Mujahidin-e Khalq Organization, which Iran sees is expanding its military and press activities that it launches from Iraqi lands, as Iran accuses this organization of a number of attacks and explosions that happen from time to time in Iranian cities.</seg>

<seg id="4">In a speech delivered at the opening session, Al-Tijani Haddad, the Tunisian Minister of Tourism and Chairman of the organization's executive board, confirmed that the choice of Tunisia to host this session reflects the importance of the tourism sector in Tunisia, which was recently highlighted at the Davos meeting where Tunisia was classified as first class with regard to the attention paid by its public authorities to the tourism sector.</seg>
<seg id="5">He explained that the new world situation characterized by uncertainty compels the tourist authorities to enhance their ability to adapt to changes and to adjust their strategies to respond to the requirements of these developments that have become difficult to predict.</seg>
<seg id="6">He pointed out that the transformations taking place in tourism make it imperative for the organization to make the necessary efforts in order to contribute as a specialized agency to achieving the millennium development goals and to provide better support to member countries in implementing their development programs.</seg>
<seg id="7">He noted the need to better explore the opportunities offered by the tourism sector in order to spread the benefits generated by the sector to the various social groups, regions, and countries that are most deprived.</seg>
<seg id="8">He emphasized that the role of tourism in poverty eradication and in sustainable development is one of the most prominent motives that place responsibility upon the organization's executive board to work for better solidarity among the members of this organization, which has become a specialized agency of the United Nations.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Chairman of the National Security Council in the Iranian Consultative Assembly added that the basis of talks and cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency is an important and accepted principle.</seg>
<seg id="6">Boroujerdi also referred to the talks between Larijani's and Solana's assistants, as well as the recent statement of the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, who said that some people must grasp the new realities of the Iranian civilian nuclear activities, which angered the Americans.</seg>

<seg id="2">China called on the United Nations today, Tuesday, to carry out an objective and fair assessment of its efforts to fight human trafficking, and rejected the United States' criticism of the country's handling of illegal trespassers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said at a regularly-scheduled press conference that "The United States' accusation (of China concerning its treatment of illegal immigrants from North Korea) is groundless."</seg>
<seg id="4">The US State Department had issued its annual "Human Trafficking Report" last week listing China in the Tier 2 Watch for the third year and criticizing its treatment of illegal immigrants from DPRK.</seg>
<seg id="5">Qin said that it is known to everyone that the illegal immigrants from DPRK came to China for economic reasons and were not "victims."</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that the Chinese government always treats such illegal immigrants in accordance with domestic and international laws and humanitarian principles, a matter that is widely appreciated by the international community.</seg>
<seg id="7">Qin added that the Chinese government has paid much attention to protecting its citizens' rights, eradicating the trafficking of women and children and has made great progress in this regard through unrelenting efforts.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said that China also participated in international cooperation to fight human trafficking and illegal immigration and made remarkable accomplishments.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added "We hope that the American government looks at all this with objectivity and fairness."</seg>

<seg id="2">Khomeini described in statements he gave here today, Wednesday, the presence of the Iraqi people at the elections as unprecedented, adding that "Those who oppose the elections are in fact opposing the interests of the Iraqi people. The US and Britain, and unfortunately some regional states, are at the top of the list of these groups that oppose the interests of the Iraqi people."</seg>
<seg id="3">Khomeini expressed his country's willingness to provide the necessary support to the people and government of Iraq to restore security to this country. He added that the US opposes the rapprochement between Iran and Iraq and strives to prevent the establishment of close relations between the two countries, but all of these attempts must be counteracted.</seg>
<seg id="4">He considered the presence of the occupation forces and the lack of security to be Iraq's most important problems, and implied that the US provides terrorist groups in Iraq with arms, and added that these practices will one day be a burden to the US forces,</seg>
<seg id="5">as it had armed groups in Afghanistan that later turned against it. He pointed to the US attempts to create sedition in the area, especially in Palestine, saying that what is happening in Palestine and the pressures confronting the elected Palestinian government are a cause for concern.</seg>

<seg id="2">General Director of the United Nations-funded organization Francesco Bandarin stated today, Friday, that the World Heritage Committee added the new sites during its session that was convened in Christchurch.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new sites include 16 cultural sites, five natural sites, and one site that has both cultural and natural characteristics, raising the number of sites listed on the World Heritage list to 851 sites.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an unprecedented decision in the history of the UNESCO agreement for the protection of world cultural and natural heritage, the committee has deleted one of the sites -- the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary -- from the list because of Jordan's failure to preserve the outstanding global value of the Sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="5">The UNESCO's World Heritage list includes, after adding 660 cultural sites this year, 166 natural sites, and 25 sites that have both characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's worth mentioning that in 1972, the UNESCO adopted the World Heritage Agreement as a way to encourage defining and protecting the most outstanding cultural and natural heritage sites in the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">This agreement, in which 183 countries participate and which includes more than 830 sites, is considered one of the United Nations greatest agreements in terms of the support that it receives.</seg>

<seg id="1">In view of the occurrence of some incidents of fraud and deception, armed robbery, and the occasional use of weapons, and sometimes the murder of some Saudi tourists in the recent past, especially after the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon, there's been a lot of talk and warning against travel to Syria, especially here in the square.</seg>
<seg id="2">I think that sometimes the matter transcends the context of the incident, and so the warning against tourism travel to Syria disparages the Syrians, and makes the Syrian people, or most of them, appear to approve what happens to the tourists, or at least of the policy of the Syrian government.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everywhere on the surface of the earth, there are bad and evil people -- in Saudi Arabia, in Syria, and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">We, in this country of Saudi Arabia, have many security problems,</seg>
<seg id="5">but we have a habit of focusing the spotlight on others. We forget ourselves and the problems we suffer from.</seg>
<seg id="6">Anyone who wants to verify what I am writing, ought to go and sit only one hour in the police station nearest to his house, and see the volume of complaints, disputes, deprived rights, thefts, and other things...</seg>
<seg id="7">even though the state at present has become aware of this security gap which had been ignored for years, given the focus by the security authorities on terrorism alone.</seg>
<seg id="8">The evidence for this is the large number of hands being cut off this month to stem the spread of robberies, which have unfortunately become a widespread phenomenon everywhere in the Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">So if we, in a rich country like Saudi Arabia, suffer from widespread robberies -- clandestine, forced, and at times violent -- do we blame an entire poor people because there are some criminals among them?</seg>

<seg id="5">Some of us have even reached the point of saying that those Saudi terrorists are but a deluded group who did not draw their ideas and extremist infidel program from the culture of the society.</seg>
<seg id="6">The masses of Saudi society have lived with the great conviction that the misguided group had no principles or intellectual and ideological foundations to feed its ideas and push them to the fire and hell of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="7">So people would be suspicious with every security success in which terrorists drop like moths drop on the light of lamps.</seg>

<seg id="10">We have come to watch this intellectual infighting and conflict between a large number of figures of the intellectual movements, exchanging accusations and charges of being agents for foreign countries, and accusing some of the religious preachers of supporting terrorism and extremists.</seg>

<seg id="4">Now whoever arranged for that campaign against the organization does not aim at exposing the its downsides or at settling personal scores.. Rather, they aim beyond that..</seg>

<seg id="7">Yes.. The faults of the organization are from head to toe.. and we won't get into the boring details that people are debating..</seg>
<seg id="8">The main faults, as I witnessed them with my own eyes, are that many men in the organization who deal directly with the public are selected for their piety, and God knows best..</seg>
<seg id="9">There is an important aspect which was neglected, that has to do with the psychological and social aspect, namely, the manner of dealing with people.. The issue is not about laws to be enforced.. but rather winning that public..</seg>
<seg id="10">From my own perspective, for example, it is better for someone to go to the mosque voluntarily than to go coerced after being whipped and humiliated.. Compare this issue to all the faults of the organization and the aversion of many to its work...!!.</seg>

<seg id="7">As a result, the verdict is described as having a political character, and this scene, unfortunately, happened before with the execution of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, the half-brother of deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and also Awad Ahmad al-Bandar, the former chief judge of the revolutionary court, both of whom were sentenced to execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Barzan al-Tikriti was executed in a manner violating all international and humanitarian norms, since his head was severed from his body and flew for a distance of 30 meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">This penalty, which we are demanding to be abolished, is implemented in a manner incompatible with international and humanitarian norms, which is what we noted in the execution of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on the first day of the last Eid al-Adha, which caused resentment and sadness in all the Arab world on that holiday.</seg>

<seg id="3">In a statement to the daily "al-Alam al-Jadid," Sahrawi delegation member Mr. Mohamed Abdi Ould Ibrahim expressed his disappointment over the conduct of the government, despite the fact that he and his companions had taken the trouble to come.</seg>

<seg id="8">He added, "The eviction of the Sahrawi delegation -- from an official function in Nouakchott -- constitutes a shameful stain on the Mauritanian government.

<seg id="7">On the other side of the Mediterranean Sea, the Spanish have made big strides in exploiting the sea and the beaches in a way that led to the creation of new, clean, and brilliant tourist cities that have now made Spain, the country that recently joined the European Union, an attraction and a destination for tourists from all countries of the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">One notices in that country, especially in Andalusia, what the tourist does not see in our country except in some of its southern cities. Towering palm trees have invaded Andalusia, planted in all the streets, alleyways, public squares, on the coasts and city centers. They make for an enchanting scene, adorning the Spanish cities. They give them a dazzling look which Moroccans cannot see unless they travel to Marrakech, but even then, they won't find them as they are in Andalusia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Beaches that do not have the beauty of Morocco's beaches, but still attract tourists from all parts of the world, so much so that these cities are no longer owned by the Spanish as much as they are a mixture of ownership of British, Germans, Dutch, Moroccans, and eastern Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="10">These beaches have coarse sand, not like the fine, golden sand of Morocco, but their glimmer has bewitched some tourists who now own property and live there permanently. They visit each year thanks to what Spanish tourism offers in these regions, which is something we lack.</seg>

<seg id="2">150 Bosnian Muslim women filed a lawsuit against the Dutch state before the Dutch Supreme Court in The Hague on account of the Srebrenica massacre in June of 1995, where it was the responsibility of the Dutch military forces to protect the city.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defense of the women victims, who are suing the Dutch state for the first time as mothers of the thousands of dead victims of the massacre that occurred during the Bosnia-Herzegovina war with Serbia, accuses the Dutch state, represented by the military forces which were affiliated to the United Nations in the city of Srebrenica, of not discharging its duties of protecting the residents of the aforementioned city,</seg>
<seg id="4">and that it allowed the Serbian forces to commit massacres in a city falling under its responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="5">About 7,000 Muslims, including women, men, elderly, and children, became victims of these crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">These Bosnian women, who said they represented 6,000 of the victims of this massacre for which the Dutch state bears responsibility, traveled by bus on a trip that took 40 hours to reach The Hague.</seg>
<seg id="7">These women hope that the outcome of this lawsuit will be that the Dutch state admit to and bear responsibility for these massacres.</seg>
<seg id="8">These women wore white shirts bearing the logo of the Srebrenica massacre.</seg>
<seg id="9">They stood in silent protest in front of the Dutch government headquarters surrounded by the media.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the Bosnian women, accompanied by Dutch and Bosnian lawyers, proceeded to deliver the bill of indictment.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the Bosnian lawyers said that responsibility for this massacre fell on the Dutch state and the United Nations,</seg>

<seg id="13">but he ruled out demanding financial compensation for the time being.</seg>

<seg id="4">First, Egyptian regional security has principles and positions vis-a-vis what happens in the Gaza Strip, and also to the extent that there is a need for the presidency and its approach, and Hamas and its approach, to reach common denominators, at least provisionally.</seg>

<seg id="7">Perhaps for several months now, the two sides have been facing some of the manifestations of the security chaos, as they have come to call it.</seg>

<seg id="9">But there are new tasks at hand for the existing challenges for each of Egypt and its regional security, as well as for Hamas and the presidency, for which the two adversaries may have found common denominators before the emergence, and in the simplest terms without complications, of radical fundamentalist groups in the Gaza Strip. These could demolish the political programs of the presidency and of Hamas as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">Doubtless, there is disagreement between the points of view, the tactics, and the strategy of Hamas's program and the thinking of al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="11">As for the presidency's program, these radical groups, as it were, consider it as a program that is absolutely in line with the interests of America and Zionism.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new projects will increase the quantity of water produced in al-Jizah Governorate by about 346,000 additional cubic meters to serve 1,435 million citizens in the three regions, and the cost of the new projects was 196 million Egyptian pounds.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was announced by Engineer Hussein Khalid, Chief Executive of the Drinking Water and Sewer Authority in Greater Cairo and Alexandria,</seg>
<seg id="5">who noted that the three projects are a realization of President Mubarak's election campaign program.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that the first project is a pipeline from Imbaba Station to al-Rimaya. It serves Faysal Street and its adjacent areas on both its eastern and western sides, al-Rimaya area, and the Pyramids Gardens, serving about 360,000 people. It is 26 km long and has a daily production capacity of 100,000 cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The second project is a conduit from Imbaba Station to Awsim. It serves the city and center of Awsim and some of the villages in the jurisdiction of Imbaba north of al-Jizah, serving about 175,000 people, with a daily capacity of 36,000 cubic meters. It is 10 km long, including all its extensions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third project is for the improvement of drinking water in North al-Haram. It serves the residents of the Youth Residences, the Pyramids hill, North King Faysal, and the Cairo-Alexandria desert road. It has cost 95 million Egyptian pounds and it is 181 km long, with a daily capacity of 210,000 cubic meters per day.</seg>
<seg id="9">Engineer Mahmoud Amer, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood parliamentary bloc for the district of Awsim, submitted a request to bring clean water to the city of Awsim, and this was approved. Thus he fulfills the pledges he made to serve the people of his district.</seg>

<seg id="13">Prince Bandar bin Sultan played a central role in the negotiations with the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to conclude the arms deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper and television reported that the issue of the bribery was uncovered in an investigation conducted by the Anti-Fraud Office on information concerning bribes and corruption, in the context of the al-Yamamah deal related to the purchase and maintenance of Tornadoes fighter jets.</seg>
<seg id="15">The British group collected revenues of 43 billion pounds (84.4 billion dollars) from this contract. The British group admitted that it offered "assistance services" to Saudi officials, saying that this was not contrary to the law.</seg>
<seg id="16">Company attorneys acknowledged offering "the services" in a letter dated November 2005 that they addressed to the Anti-Fraud Office, which was then investigating the possibility of receiving bribes during the conclusion of the huge al-Yamamah deal between Britain and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the eighties of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="17">The British government had stopped the investigation in December 2006, on the request from Prime Minister Tony Blair on the grounds of the country's public interest.</seg>
<seg id="18">Newspapers mentioned that Saudi Arabia threatened to cancel a new deal for the purchase of "Eurofighter" fighter jets.</seg>
<seg id="19">Blair repeatedly defended this decision for which he was criticized by the Anti-Corruption Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and by certain non-governmental organizations and British officials.</seg>
<seg id="20">The British Defense Ministry refused to comment on the issue on Thursday, considering that "this matter will lead to the disclosure of secret information about the al-Yamamah deal and to problems that the cancellation of the investigation aimed to avoid."</seg>

<seg id="3">saying that he is not accusing the group.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with the al-Arabiyah satellite channel, Mourad said that "stability in Lebanon is achieved through a national unity government, and through it security can be better controlled...and these assassinations will be under control, and their perpetrators will be arrested."</seg>
<seg id="5">Walid Eido, the Lebanese parliamentarian representing the Future bloc, was killed earlier on Wednesday in an explosion that targeted his car, which also led to the death of his son and four other persons.</seg>
<seg id="6">Parliamentarians from the anti-Syrian March 14 alliance accused Damascus of being behind the assassination minutes after the death of MP Eido was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mourad said that "political assassination is not a policy of the Syrian state... which denies and condemns it,"</seg>

<seg id="3">Prime Minister Fouad Siniora called for evacuating the remaining civilians from the camp in preparation, seemingly, for the final strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">A military source described the fighting as fiercer than usual at Nahr al-Bared camp, where the army is waging battles for the fourth consecutive week against al-Qaeda-aligned group, Fatah al-Islam.</seg>
<seg id="5">No less than 136 people, including 60 soldiers, have been killed in the worst fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. And 11 soldiers were killed and more than 100 were wounded in battles that broke out early in the week.</seg>
<seg id="6">The army is clashing with Fatah al-Islam fighters at the outskirts of the camp, which used to shelter some 40,000 people before the fighting broke out, forcing thousands to flee, the majority of whom sought refuge in the nearby Baddawi camp. Evacuating the remaining refugees: relief workers are struggling to evacuate the civilians who remain trapped inside the camp,</seg>
<seg id="7">while the Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora called for the need to evacuate the civilians who have not yet left "to preserve their lives," in response "to the appeals they are making."</seg>
<seg id="8">But Siniora urged caution "against the possible redeployment of Fatah al-Islam elements, exploiting the evacuation operation," so that terrorist acts do not begin to occur outside the camp.</seg>
<seg id="9">Elsewhere, the Lebanese Army denied news indicating that gunmen believed to belong to Fatah al-Islam had kidnapped two Lebanese soldiers from a street in Tripoli and that these elements were demanding their safe passage to the Syrian borders in exchange for releasing the kidnapped soldiers, pledging not to harm them.</seg>

<seg id="2">The American movie is at risk of disappearing from Egyptian cinemas after dominating them from the 80s until now, and the reason is the emergence of new competitors who promote European movies, especially French movies, and movies from East Asia,</seg>
<seg id="3">now that a major company, known for its calculated and successful ventures, obtained agency for running Indian movies at the same time that they are shown in India.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opinions differ about this issue. Antoine Zand, a distributor of American movies in Egypt, said that showing European, Indian and Korean movies is but a temporary phenomenon which will end,</seg>
<seg id="5">especially since they are haphazardly circulated, and consequently will not hold out against the American films, and will not shake their domination in the Egyptian cinemas.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zand attributed the presence of Italian movies in the 60s and Indian movies in the 80s to the fact that, during those periods, movie distributors relied on the Italian community in Egypt or Egyptians of Italian descent.</seg>
<seg id="7">As for Indian movies, they were more organized; there was an agent who specialized in this genre, but after his death these movies disappeared and no longer had any presence after him.</seg>
<seg id="8">He asserted that the American movie will not be threatened by the "fad" of the coming movies because they are random and unorganized, and it will continue to firmly dominate the foreign movie sector in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Adel Adib, the representative of the company "Good News", said that he has in fact obtained an agency for Indian movies in Egypt, where an Indian film is shown at the same time that it is shown in India, in coordination with the Indian companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also, a plan, and a market study of the film market as well as an intensive marketing campaign for the next three years were laid, and there is also a similar plan for European and Korean movies.</seg>

<seg id="2">I think that the position of the United States of America on Islamic issues, at the forefront of which is the Kashmir issue, is a position based on a double standard policy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The United States of America stands with India, despite its continued rejection, and manipulation of international resolutions on the Kashmir issue for more than half a century.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also stands with the Zionist entity despite its continued refusal to implement international resolutions in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="5">The American government has not, and will not, exert any pressures on India to settle the Kashmir issue in accordance with international resolutions, much as it has not and will not exert any pressures on the Zionist entity to resolve the Palestine issue in accordance with international resolutions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hence, President Pervez Musharraf's call to the United States of America for help in reaching a solution to the Kashmir issue will not lead to any solutions to the problem. *.</seg>
<seg id="7">** What are the bases or the focal points on which you are seeking to solve the Kashmir issue through??</seg>
<seg id="8">Solving the issue of Kashmir rests on two fundamental points: first, the 1947 A.D resolution to partition the South Asian Peninsula that stipulates joining the provinces of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan because they have a Muslim majority,</seg>
<seg id="9">and second, the 1948 A.D and 1949 A.D international resolutions that stipulate holding a referendum to determine the fate of the province; to join either India or Pakistan.</seg>

<seg id="3">From the name of the company, it appears that its owner never traded in illegal substances of any type; not bricks of hashish, or opium, or packets of the cannabis that has consumed the brains of the Egyptian youth. The company was also not one of the maritime companies specializing in dispatching Egyptians to the afterworld by drowning them in the salty waters of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neither did Al-Shorouk Company specialize in importing carcinogenic wheat, nor did al-Ansari trade in contaminated blood or fight people to take their political seats.</seg>
<seg id="5">In light of all this, why then this security onslaught against his company to shut it down and render jobless the young people working there?</seg>
<seg id="6">Knowledgeable sources have confirmed that the reason al-Shorouk for Press Services was shut down was a type of birth control (!!); when the Ministry of Health and Population learned that the company had young people on the verge of marriage, it immediately instructed the inspection and security services to control the situation and to prevent those young people from consummating the marriage by shutting down their only source of livelihood, thus preventing them from reproducing, so that the Messenger of God, prayers and peace of God be upon Him, cannot boast about them to the nations on the Day of Resurrection.</seg>
<seg id="7">The closure came one day after the allocation of 120 million pounds for birth control (see al-Ahram, p.1, on the day of the disaster).</seg>
<seg id="8">Other sources said that the closure of al-Shorouk for Press Services Company was because the company's owner, Adel al-Ansari, was in contact with foreign Sudanese, Saudi, and Mauritanian parties (!!), and when I asked the sources for further clarification, they referred me to the history books to confirm the truth about what they said.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa List, the Alternative List, and the Independent Palestine List- the Palestinian National Initiative said in a statement, a copy of which was received by Maa : "It is clear that this decree oversteps all the laws stipulating the guarantee of freedom of action of associations, organizations and societies, and gives absolute authority to the Executive Branch to interfere in their affairs without legal justification or procedural grounds, as stipulated by the Civil Society Associations and Foundations Law number 1 for the year 2000.</seg>
<seg id="5">The blocs added that we have always prided ourselves as Palestinians with the Civil Society Associations Law, since it reflected, in letter and in spirit, Palestinian democracy and the state of civil society for which the Law was an important factor in strengthening and moving it forward, through the rise of a civilized and enlightened society.</seg>
<seg id="6">The blocs said: "We believe that the enforcement of the decree as it was issued constitutes a big setback for democracy in our country, and therefore we demand that this decree be retracted and its implementation be stopped, to safeguard democratic life in Palestine."</seg>

<seg id="2">The presence of a role model in someone's life is one of the good things that makes a person persevere to attain and achieve the goal he chose for his life. And a role model may give you great power to focus on success and achieve distinction in life.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is said that a father asked his son: "Who is your role model?"</seg>
<seg id="4">So he replied: "You, father."</seg>
<seg id="5">And so the father replied saying: "Good choice. Omar bin al-Khattab, may God be please with him, was my role model and I became what I am. So what will you be?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Choosing a role model may contribute to determining personality, and if you say 'tell me who your role model is and I'll tell you who you are,' many people would choose famous and known celebrities to be their role models,</seg>
<seg id="7">and we do not know the fate of those who choose artists and singers as role models, in spite of the evil and decadence in which many of them live.</seg>
<seg id="8">In order to be great, you must choose a great role model, which contributes to raising the level of your intellect, makes you feel important and gives you the incentive to attain the level of that role model, even if for a few steps, but on condition that you take the initiative to develop yourself, persevering to progress and letting yourself strive to get there.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not enough to choose a role model, and sit in your place without taking a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the biggest things that contributed to young generations lagging behind is the absence of role models in their lives. Children are raised on cartoonish role models and imaginary drawings, and they grow up with them, with the blessing of the family and the parents.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many parents are keen to buy the necessities that portray these figures, and bedroom walls are painted with images of these figures, such that our children grow up admiring Spiderman, Barbie and other such superficial figures.</seg>

Whenever the parties get close and reach an understanding on national unity and shared responsibility, infighting and endless clashes by some putschist parties in the security services of Fatah pop up to destroy it.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is my belief that these are orders from big wigs, and some criminal countries on the international stage may interfere, led by America and Israel.</seg>

<seg id="5">For Hamas, the putschists are Fatah's criminal group, whereas you find that the putschists in the Fatah forums are Hamas and its government.</seg>
<seg id="6">And I don't know how a sane person would describe them as putschists when they are the legitimate ones in the Palestinian Authority and they are the ones who represent the majority in the Legislative and Ministerial Councils.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some are upset about the control by Hamas and its victory over the Security Services, but whoever looks carefully at the latest situation will realize that these Security Services under Dahlan's command have caused mayhem. They repeatedly tried to assassinate the Prime Minister and the Hamas ministers despite signing agreements and despite pledges by all parties in Fatah not to harm the legitimacy of Hamas and its men.</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems that the senior men in Fatah have no control over the putschist leaderships, and in spite of all the unity slogans and Fatah's participation in the unity government, the assassinations and the security chaos have forced Hamas to combat corruption, topple the putschists and evict them from the Gaza Strip after they transgressed all the red and yellow lines.</seg>

<seg id="3">The B'Tselem organization had sent a request to the Israeli Interior Ministry to disclose the number of Jerusalemite citizens whose citizenship has been revoked. Notably, the citizenship of 222 citizens was revoked in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is noteworthy that Arab citizens who are residents of Jerusalem were granted permanent residence status, which gives them most of the privileges enjoyed by the citizens of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="5">Under Israeli law, the Hebrew State has the right to revoke the citizenship of any Arab citizen who is a resident of Jerusalem if he were to reside outside the country or in the Palestinian Authority areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israel has adopted a policy of collective citizenship revocation from groups of Jerusalemite residents since 1995, during the term of the ill-remembered Eli Suissa who occupied the post of Director of the Jerusalem Brigade at the Israeli Interior Ministry, to the point that the issue of citizenship revocation of Jerusalemites worsened with Suissa's appointment as Minister for the fundamentalist Shas Party in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="7">Suissa persisted in putting obstacles for construction permits by applicants who are Jerusalem Arab residents, which led to a gross decline in residential houses forcing many to leave Jerusalem.

<seg id="2">Functional Basis of All Genes in Mammals Depends on Daily Temporal Rhythm.</seg>
<seg id="3">This study refutes the current theory, which says that only 10-15% of genes are affected by the biological clock.</seg>
<seg id="4">While it has been known to scientists for a long time that a daily temporal rhythm, or the natural circadian clock, regulates the behavior of the living being, the study shows that this circadian clock controls and governs all of life's functions, particularly the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="5">A knowledge of the properties of the temporal activity of the genes that play a role in metabolism is essential and basic to understanding how genes interact with, and how they regulate, health and disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">Researcher Batetsen says: "For example, when dieting, you know that one should eat late at night,</seg>
<seg id="7">and now we are able to know why.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have found that all genes have specific changes in activity during the day.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each genetic activity pathway is affected by the clock or the daily rhythm,</seg>
<seg id="10">and the timing and synchronization of this rhythm is critical to each set of genes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers have also found short and long versions of some genes that fluctuate in the other direction.</seg>
<seg id="12">These genes are basic and essential components of the signaling system of the Leptin hormone.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fluctuation pattern varies for different organs,</seg>
<seg id="14">and determines the impact of Leptin on regulating the energy balance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Providing greater understanding of the nature of gene fluctuation gives researchers solutions for developing ways to deal with people who eat more food than their body needs due to an imbalance in the Leptin indicators.</seg>
<seg id="16">The daily periodic rhythm is a vital biological rhythm over a 24-hour period of time, and it acts to regulate the period and time of most physiological and behavioral functions such as sleep, eating and activity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Parliamentary sources revealed to al-Akhbar today, Sunday 6/24/2007, a decision made by the new Mauritanian authorities to eliminate four important Mauritanian embassies abroad, most notably the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan, while the President did not go forward to eliminate the embassy in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="3">The source said that confirmed information received by Parliament two days ago, said that the President decided to eliminate the following Mauritanian embassies due to financial, not political, pressures: the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan, the Mauritanian embassy in Japan, the Mauritanian embassy in Britain, and the Mauritanian embassy in Canada,</seg>
<seg id="4">but he refused to eliminate the Mauritanian embassy in Tel Aviv, even though it cost about 20 million ouguiyas in 2005, because of its political nature. This has provoked much debate between the opposition and the regime in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The same sources said that there is a general inclination in Parliament to oppose the decision, particularly since the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan is more important, as there is a Mauritanian expatriate community in Jordan, especially of students.</seg>
<seg id="6">The economic activity and the political character of the embassy also make its closure at a time when there is an ambassador in Tel Aviv (who may perhaps handle the affairs of the expatriate community in Jordan) seen as an outrageous situation that is harmful to inter-Arab relations, particularly since this is the first time that a decision of this nature has been taken since the closure of the Mauritanian embassy in Iraq, after the former Iraqi President was accused of undermining security inside Mauritania, according to the parliamentary sources.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Mauritanian government needs the Parliament's approval of the budget of any Mauritanian embassy abroad as part of the government's general budget; this is scheduled to be brought before Parliament in an emergency session.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, parliamentary sources ruled out the new Parliament's approval of the budget for the Mauritanian embassy in Tel Aviv, on the grounds that this would be a waste of the people's property on an issue they reject altogether.</seg>

<seg id="2">Only a decade passed since the defeat of Germany and Japan in World War II before they licked the wounds of their defeats and proceeded with their own reconstruction, beginning with their understanding of the balance of power and the spirit of the post-war era, until they became two economic giants that have their place in the international balance of power. As for us, the June 5, 1967 defeat continues to haunt us to this day!</seg>
<seg id="3">The contemporary history of the Arab world in general, and the Arab mashriq in particular, is a series of events that were formed and organized as results of this defeat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat engendered profound effects in all of Arab life, for it was not only a military defeat sustained by the Arab armies but a universal defeat for all members of Arab society, since it was a test of the "socialism" that was built, the "development" that was achieved, and the "security state" that was established.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whatever the case may be, the defeat was a harbinger of a change in the course of events towards more Arab decline, and a historic turning point whose dynamic became very clear from the 70s of the last century until this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">The defeat was not a transient moment in Arab life, for it placed all the Arab peoples on a decline from which they were not rescued by the October 1973 War, which turned into a political defeat whose repercussions continued in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Arab societies, which have managed a semblance of modernization, have relapsed into the worst of their history; that is, into a pattern of political life that is as close as it can be to the pattern of life in the Mameluke/Ottoman era. The most prominent of the latter's features are the separation of the government from the people, the separation of society from the state, the stagnation of society and the solidification of its internal history, and the hegemony of a traditional ideology that fosters dependency, compliance, impotence, aversion and fear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Love is a beautiful human feeling, the discipline that man imposed on his natural need, exactly as is the case with food, drink and the need for safety........ etc. Consequently, feeling and practicing it depends on the degree of civilization attained by the person, which in this case, as with everything else, is subject to the power of the mind that determines needs and shows the way to satisfy them.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hence, I completely disagree with the great singer Suad Muhammad that love emanates from the heart or from the eye and I have to choose between the two, as she wondered and expressed her confusion in the famous song!</seg>
<seg id="4">Love, like anything else, stems from the need for it, and the mind is like a kind of device to satisfy human needs, so to speak, choosing between the alternatives to see which is better and most appropriate for satisfaction.. and there are some who realize this, and some who don't.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the lack of awareness, arise all the metaphysical explanations for love; from Cupid, fate and fortune, destiny, to what will eventually happen, this concept is widespread in most of our romantic Arabic songs!</seg>

<seg id="3">Is this right? For most intellectuals, and even the enlightened and activist writers in Egypt, this incident did not represent the importance that I thought it had. It was not mentioned at all, except by a few writers, and it wasn't addressed by analysis and scrutiny from any of those programs that we thought were programs with a significant window with which to enlighten the people.</seg>
<seg id="4">I say, if the deputies of the People's Assembly are the highest authority representing the people, even if we concede the fraud, but ultimately it is considered the greatest spokesperson for the people and their deputies, and they represent the dignity of all the Egyptian people;</seg>

<seg id="4">through something it calls "citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="5">If you were to look for the definition of this citizenship among the Mubarak regime intellectuals, you will find marvels,</seg>
<seg id="6">since this citizenship, as defined by the regime's thinkers, tells the Egyptians that they are not only citizens of a single country, but some are Christians and others are Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Muslims have Article 2 and the others, the Christians, have Article 5.</seg>
<seg id="8">They imposed a schism, knowingly or unknowingly, between Egyptians, even in their book and the constitution of their country.</seg>

<seg id="10">The regime did not bring this sectarianism, as you claim,</seg>
<seg id="11">it did the opposite and it extinguished the apprehension of our brothers the Christian Egyptians."</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, it may appear that this is technically sound, but I think that, practically, on the ground, it is useless, in my opinion.</seg>

<seg id="8">These confrontations quickly spread to a large number of Moroccan universities such as Marrakech, Casablanca, and al-Rachidiya.</seg>
<seg id="9">The situation in the latter was the most dangerous and tense because it was the scene of a student's death as a result of these barbaric incidents that no mind can accept and no logic can approve.</seg>
<seg id="10">One university and constant violence:</seg>
<seg id="11">In the 70s of last century, the leftist movement controlled the Moroccan universities, which made the Moroccan student movement revolve around socialist and communist ideas that experienced a big revival at the time, with the presence of the then-superpower, the Soviet Union, which was promoting and financing ideas of revolution and coups.</seg>
<seg id="12">This made the majority of students adopt these ideas and defend them. In fact, the students were on the side of the struggling working classes, which were as the engine that leads the socialist communist advance in the world at that time.</seg>
<seg id="13">During that period, antagonising the left and not revolving in its orbit would expose one to barbaric violence in its extreme.</seg>

<seg id="6">As for some others, they exhibit only what they believe to be the positive aspects of their societies, and turn a blind eye to what ought to be rectified and reformed.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you see this other kind of local intellectuals seem to be as though they are living in Lala Land or in an ever happy, smiling, and optimistic utopia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rationalism or the traditional space in which the local intellectual operates in Kuwait must be "balanced", warning others against that which is negative.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is a role suitable for proposing practical solutions to the daily problems facing Kuwaiti society, and at the same time the local intellectual must talk about a coming future that is happy, successful, and filled with hope if this or that direction suggested by the intellectual is followed.</seg>

<seg id="2">From time to time, cries arise accusing the Shiites of a lack of patriotism, and that their allegiance is to Iran and not to their nations.</seg>
<seg id="3">This false accusation, of course, results for several reasons, but the most important is that some of those crying out ignore the fact that the basis for the dispute over allegiance goes back to the issue of the Imamate or the Shura, from which diverges the issue of allegiance to the ruler or allegiance to the land.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yet, some others who accuse the Shiites of allegiance to Iran ignore the intuitive law that says that a human being, Shiite or Sunni, is naturally inclined to love the country in which he grew up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whoever delves a little into history will find that accusing the Shiites of non-allegiance is not an invention of today, but is hundreds of years old. It originally goes back to the fact that the Shiites believe in the theory of the Imamate while the Sunnis believe in the theory of the Shura.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is, of course, not the time to explain the theories of the Shiites and the Sunnis, but I will say that, after the disappearance of the Imam Mohammed Ibn al-Hassan (may God hasten his return), who is the 12th Imam of the Shiites, the Shiites had to resort to the jurists, who must meet a number of conditions, in accordance with the last message of Imam Mahdi (may God hasten his return) before his disappearance.</seg>
<seg id="7">And the jurist to whom they must resort can be from Saudi Arabia, or Iran, or Afghanistan, because the conditions state the attributes of the jurist and not his nationality, while the Sunnis continued to rule under the theory of the Shura and they believe that the ruler is the one to whom allegiance is owed, regardless of whether that ruler is good or corrupt. After a period of time, and after the failure of the nationalists' movement at the height of the Islamic revival, a Sunni movement emerged: the Brotherhood.</seg>

<seg id="4">Why did Satan, who whispered to him to kill these women, not whisper to him to kill himself too, blow his head off and lie besides his daughters.. whose blood he shed in all savagery.</seg>

<seg id="7">Are the insolence and the daring, with which this criminal attacked his wife and daughters, a natural reaction to the manifestations of violence and obvious discrimination from which the Saudi woman suffers, such that this matter now threatens her to be killed at the hands of her family?</seg>
<seg id="8">I think that the judicial ruling which will be issued should put an end to this criminal who shed the blood of four innocent women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The time has come when the dream begins by asking its subdued questions, and the lips smile to stories people have grown tired of believing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is what I was thinking when I dared hope that all the defeats that have passed will end, simply for a new battle to erupt.</seg>
<seg id="4">My wound was not the result of frustration. Rather, it was the outcome of the silence that allows everything, even the substitution of the poems of Iraq's poets with the shells of the American bombing or with the bullets of the ruling militias in a nation that has the precedent of enacting the first law of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The victims' cadavers, which are sold in the Iraq of the American-Iranian death, were no more than other stabs, since nothing that has not been corrupted is left for the living.</seg>
<seg id="6">And now the turn has come for the dead to foot the bill for being Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's a historic score being settled by Iraq, packaged by the American administration and Iran in promises of democracy, or as concern for the interests of the people of Iraq who are killed every day with American and Iranian weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">If Iran is still imbued with its grudges against the Arabs for having crushed the state of Xerxes during the era of Omar Bin al-Khattab, which is why Persia's hatred for Caliph al-Adil and the Arabs has remained in the beliefs and rituals that can only be described as Sufi,</seg>
<seg id="9">the American administration is a captive of the desire to destroy the Arabs and seize their wealth, and fulfill the Israeli dream.</seg>
<seg id="10">What happens daily in Iraq is not only a power struggle for influence; it is genocide in the sense of the word for a people whose memory is filled with pain, and for the Arab identity of this nation where Arabs had their greatest historic roles when Baghdad became the capital of the Caliphate.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nothing in Iraq is being accomplished except death and destruction, and there is no hope except resistance, and the patience of its people, and the awakening of their nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">But who will be victorious in the battle for Iraq's Arab identity, when the killer is a superpower, the neighbor is hateful, the ally to both is an Arab, and the victim is Arab-Arab?</seg>

<seg id="2">Poetry is a form of literature, a vessel in which the poet pours all his moods during the night and at the beginning and the end of the day. It is the mirror of the soul, the fruit of the mind, and the contradiction between the mind and the self.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is also known that literature educates and entertains, two sides of an equation that is impossible to solve, and is never-ending.</seg>
<seg id="4">Poetry will remain until judgment day, and will not stop before an age or a dilemma. Rather, it is the dilemma at which the secrets of the soul stand, and the secrets of nature, the results of thoughts, and the exhausted insomnia, and it is the language that bursts into leaf once in a while.</seg>
<seg id="5">It shows the psychology of the poet that ebbs and flows.</seg>
<seg id="6">The poet is an unusual and complex living creature, a vessel for numerous personae in his person.</seg>
<seg id="7">He alone is capable of programming the yes in every (no), and, and vice versa. He alone is capable of making barren land into a green garden, and the garden into a fire that burns the feet of those who step there.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is that creature that lives in all times. We see him but he only sees us with his texts that embrace our dreams and alleviate our wounds.</seg>
<seg id="9">The poet is a very sensitive human being towards things, even to objects. He can feel them, while we do not.</seg>
<seg id="10">He predicts everything. He writes us and reads us at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="11">He broadcasts his creativity across the continents to remain alone, surrounded by hundreds, even thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="12">He enjoyed and still enjoys an elevated position in his society. Have we not seen them since pagan times, interested in the poet among storytellers, as though he were the spokesman for the tribe? Today, he is the spokesman for the world if his works attain international status.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was not easy to bring together the Tunisian journalists again to discuss and exchange points of view on a controversial topic that has caused a lot of ink to flow, and about which much has been said on all channels and sources, regarding the creation of a union that represents and defends journalists.</seg>
<seg id="3">The current union, which was established some years ago and which many activists in this field consider the balm that has the ability to correct the embarrassing -- even disgusting -- condition of the workers in the written press sector, has gone through a number of difficulties that have prevented it from adopting the demands of those for whom it is responsible, or participating in the battle to defend them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Perhaps the authority has not stayed removed from the existence of the union, taking into consideration the immense and large obstacles it has placed before it, with the goal of weakening it and killing it in the cradle. However, this was not easy.</seg>
<seg id="5">It found an echo among the majority of journalists who declared their unlimited support for their union as a structure, having the ability to frame their interests and conduct a dialogue and conversation with the authority and the managers of the newspapers so as to fulfill their aspirations.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the occasion of the examinations period, I re-post this article.</seg>
<seg id="3">It so happens that I had to proctor university students in some exams at the Faculty of Arts, in one of the universities.</seg>
<seg id="4">I have recently also been involved in university examinations,</seg>
<seg id="5">as I passed my own final university exam the year that preceded my first proctoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">I knew the students' tricks in cheating,</seg>
<seg id="7">and I knew the serious ones from the slacking ones.</seg>
<seg id="8">But my opinion changed after I became a proctor, instead of being monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">And I understood the depth of the flaw or the danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">I personally used to prepare for the exam with dread, fear and terror,</seg>
<seg id="11">so I would not enter the exam room until I had memorized the subject in which I was tested or studied it and comprehended it.</seg>
<seg id="12">And the idea of cheating never occurred to me; indeed, I considered myself incapable of it.</seg>
<seg id="13">And if it so happened that I'd ask one of the students about a fact I had forgotten or a question I did not understand or something of that nature, I found myself shaking and drawing the others' attention to me.</seg>
<seg id="14">I would thus put myself in the position of the accused, or at least in a position of suspicion and misgiving.</seg>
<seg id="15">But after I became a proctor who monitors the students, and keeping in mind that it's a responsibility, and with some of the seriousness and strictness of the beginner,</seg>
<seg id="16">I discovered cheating methods that had never occurred to me, and not only the cheating methods but also the personality of the student being tested, such that cheating has become a culture, with the students exchanging their methods and techniques, and distinguishing a lenient professor from a strict one.</seg>
<seg id="17">The lucky ones are those who are monitored by a lenient professor, and in fact, they are envious of each other for that.</seg>

<seg id="2">A prominent administrative phenomenon was presented to me by an important businessman in a sarcastic manner. I will phrase it here in the form of a direct question.. Why don't the intelligent continue in their jobs?</seg>
<seg id="3">My answer here, very simply, is because their managers are less intelligent.</seg>
<seg id="4">How?</seg>
<seg id="5">The intelligent person in the area of business does not seek a limited income or superficial duties. He looks into the heart of strategic visions to contribute to building himself if he is selfish, or building himself and his society if he is noble. Both know well the details of the road they are traveling on.</seg>
<seg id="6">The creative agree on specifying phases for their financial, social, and cognitive development. This varies from one creative person to the other in the degree of the flow of creative energy in his veins.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some specify a period of two years as a phase for development while others plan on five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, others specify 20 to 30 years as a development phase, and here their progress towards the summit of success is slower than others'.</seg>
<seg id="9">The intelligent are characterized by a great degree of ability to change, and the ability to take risks.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are part of the 3% who are currently leading the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is not easy, since they lack financial stability and are more vulnerable to criticism and ridicule for the many setbacks they encounter in their lives.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, they soon control the situation, causing the other 97% to drop their jaws in shocked surprise.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patience is one of the characteristics of intelligent people, but it does not mean they remain under control for periods we might call stable, because for the most part they are characterized by rebelliousness.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their patience depends on the time it takes for ideas to mature in their minds and the availability of opportunities to execute them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Intelligent people accept sacrificing what is precious to attain what is more precious.</seg>

<seg id="7">While we all know the method followed in our country in which members reach parliament (which is, along with the Council of Ministers, a path to the nominal Shura Council in its work and performance in our country),</seg>
<seg id="8">where money, partisanship, and tribalism play very important roles in the heated competition to reach the Council. Based on that, the parliament is being populated by some illiterates and semi-educated individuals, people with shallow culture and little knowledge, and people who bring no benefit to the Council.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of them are even absent from most sessions, and for them membership in parliament becomes merely an important government position and a diplomatic passport to flaunt in front of people.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is a very big difference in the two methods in being influenced and influencing. The Saudi Shura Council is a scientific technocrat council qualified to express strong and important opinions to society and decision makers there because it consists of the most elite men of society in terms of science, knowledge, and of being informed, for whom money, tribalism, and partisanship did not play a role in their reaching their positions, rather it is the level of their knowledge, education, experience, and position.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, in our parliament we know some members that we have not heard speak for a whole year, they do not even show up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even in their presence and attendance, we find that partisan blocs influence directly and greatly the opinions of many members. We hear their opinions that are in agreement with the opinions of their blocs -- whether they are right or wrong -- whether within the ruling party or the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, the Saudi Shura system is based on respect for the existing regime and the personality of the ruler, and offering counsel and advice to him in the manner of a good entourage.</seg>
<seg id="14">It considers partisanship a crime, pluralism something that is rejected, and no one in the Shura council seeks to compete with the ruler or to defame him.</seg>

<seg id="11">Responsibility for the corruption of businessmen and the distortion of their image in society lies in the corrupt regime, because it allows some businessmen to move from the category of those who are destitute to the category of millionaires by facilitating their land sale transactions, or the sale of a public sector company.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some participants gave as examples the sale of the Al Ahram Alcoholic Beverages Company, the sale of Qaha Food Company, and others.</seg>

<seg id="2">Do I, with those words, regard as excessive the honest desire of others to search for symbols?</seg>
<seg id="3">Far from it.</seg>
<seg id="4">My most sincere and heartfelt wishes for everyone to find the largest possible number of symbols in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="5">I followed their example but found only two symbols: the crescent and the camel. That is why I decided not to search for symbols for Egypt as much as to try and unlock the symbols within it. Perhaps I'll understand before for reasons pertaining to the hypocrisy of my inner self and my ill intention.</seg>
<seg id="6">I want to create chaos for "al-Masri al-Youm" which is blessed in its blessed third year, and during which it has chosen to search for the symbols of Egypt in this blessed age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let me ask it and its blessed readers: why does Egypt need symbols, when it has its greatest symbol which lights up its night, blesses its day, leads its march to pride, plows the waves of its seas with its ferry, cultivates the wilderness with its wisdom, harvests the fruits with its hands and wipes the pain off its face.</seg>

<seg id="4">But it is not reasonable for you to say something without having convincing evidence for the accuracy of what you claim.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Yazidi is a religion and not a nationalism, and we do not need yet another fabrication seeking to blend religion and nationalism under the same name, which is non-existent in all the countries of the world.</seg>

<seg id="10">And we will see if you can hold on and defend it and on everything you say or remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="11">Long ago, an idea related to this was born with the Yazidis of Armenia who emigrated from Quresh, Van and Ararat; it was a reaction to the persecution they encountered as a result of the racist policies of the Ottoman State,</seg>
<seg id="12">which was able to incite some Muslim Kurds in order to carry out its plan. It exploited their religious sentiment and tricked them, which made them pay a price for this deception to this day.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea with our group at the time was: we are Yazidis and only Yazidis. But their intellectuals and chiefs noted the error of that position and managed to convince people and those in charge to disseminate the idea and promote it.</seg>
<seg id="14">What is commonly known about the Yazidis is that they are part of the Kurdish people. They are called Kurdish but they are not Muslims. This is confirmed by objective and neutral history writers.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lugovoi denied any involvement in killing the agent, saying that the British intelligence service and Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky are the most likely suspects.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a press conference broadcast live on Russian television yesterday, Lugovoi, who had also been a Soviet intelligence agent, said: "Britain is making me a scapegoat" in the Litvinenko case.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lugovoi started his talk by announcing that the British intelligence service previously succeeded in recruiting both Litvinenko and Berezovsky, the billionaire in exile in London.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that Litvinenko previously admitted to him that he'd been recruited and that he instructed Berezovsky to cooperate with British intelligence, and to hand over all the documents he had on Russia's National Security Council, where he worked in the secretariat during the reign of former President Boris Yeltsin. This contributed to facilitating his receiving the right to political asylum in Britain, and British citizenship later.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lugovoi admitted he didn't know who exactly killed his former colleague with the radioactive substance Polonium in London last November (November), but he said that there are three potential parties that fall under suspicion, British intelligence, the Mafia, and the billionaire Berezovsky.</seg>

<seg id="7">Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, informed the conference the day before yesterday, Tuesday, that his country will increase its gas production to 16 billion cubic meters in the year 2008 from 12 billion cubic meters this year, and will begin exporting on a large scale to Europe through the Baku-Erzurum pipeline.</seg>

<seg id="2">And I hope pondering and consideration are the motivation behind that silence, and not bewilderment or covering-up.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whatever the reason might be, I assume the issue of the visit with which the hurricane surprised us should be taken seriously, because it sends us a message that we should receive and read well to understand its contents and lessons, before it's too late.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before anything else, we should thank God that the hurricane was not as strong and brutal as the famous hurricanes of Katrina and Tsunami that hit the Asian and American coasts two years ago.

<seg id="6">Reports and official statements of Oman spoke of the deaths of 49 people, and considered 27 others as missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also destroyed the main roads and bridges that link the eastern provinces with the capital Muscat, and caused floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, it affected the crude oil exports from the Al Fahal Port, halted gas exportation in the Sur Port, and caused the flooding of a limited number of villages.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the hurricane reached the south of Iran, its magnitude had already calmed down. Its death toll didn't exceed 12 dead and 9 missing; floods displaced 40,000 people from four provinces, in which roads, bridges and houses were damaged.</seg>

<seg id="1">The General Establishment of Railways in Saudi announced that six international consortiums have qualified, as an initial stage before making bids for the implementation of the Mecca-Medina electric train project.</seg>
<seg id="2">The project covers 500 kilometers and connects the two holy cities with the city of Jeddah, on the coast of the Red Sea.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's noteworthy that the first stage included seven consortiums, of which six qualified for the second stage, and this stage is followed by the submission of project documents of the qualified consortiums, in order that the consortiums make their bids to implement the project.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Steering Committee that oversees the project adopted the technical report, which was presented by a team of the General Establishment of Railways and its advisers, UBS Bank (UBS), the National Commercial Bank, and the French Railways Company (SNCFI).</seg>
<seg id="5">The six consortiums include operators, investors and industrialists, who can fully implement the project and oversee it, whereas the winning consortium will build and operate the project for a period of fifty years, and then return it to the Saudi government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Establishment also required the operation of relatively high-speed electric trains (over 250 kilometers per hour), and that the trains pass through several stations in the connection between the three cities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project also links King Abdul Aziz Airport and Jeddah Islamic Port with the Holy Shrines.</seg>
<seg id="8">The project, which is the second stage of the projects for expanding the Establishment, which the Supreme Economic Council in Saudi approved, is considered to be specialized in the transport of passengers, and it's estimated that it will carry more than 15 million passengers a year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Establishment dedicated the first section (the Land Bridge) for commercial transport, which connects the east of the country with the west, passing through the Capital Riyadh, and which stretches to link the mining fields in the north as well as the industrial city of Al Jubayl with the main line that runs from King Abdul Aziz Port in Ad Dammam, to the Jeddah Islamic Port on the Red Sea.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judge in the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which has its seat in The Hague, decided yesterday to postpone the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor until the third of July (July) in order to resolve the problems that were presented by the defense team.</seg>
<seg id="2">Justice Julia Sebutinde, who heads the Special Court for Sierra Leone, said that Taylor's trial will be resumed on the third of July.</seg>

<seg id="6">Taylor was demanding more time and means to find a lawyer capable of defending his interests in this extremely complicated case.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taylor, 59 years old, has been detained at The Hague for almost a year and is facing eleven charges of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.</seg>
<seg id="8">And he is accused of backing the rebels who abused civilians in Sierra Leone in the 90s in a conflict that killed 120,000 people and maimed thousands.</seg>

<seg id="6">The President of the Comoros, Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, also attended the summit, on the occasion of the accession of the Union of the Comoros to the Community, unlike the Guinean President Lansana Conte, who did not attend in person and assigned his Prime Minister, Lansana Kouyate, to represent him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the countries were represented by Heads of their Governments or their Ministers of Foreign Affairs. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was represented by Minister of Agriculture, was absent from the summit.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is a boycott unprecedented in the history of Senegal, and the turnout rate in these elections will reflect its size.</seg>
<seg id="4">Babacar Gueye, president of a coalition of eleven civil society organizations, said that "the greatest challenge in these elections, on the political level, is the rate of participation.</seg>

<seg id="8">On the other hand, the alliance of "Sopi" (meaning "change" in the Wolof language, the most common in the country), which includes the Senegalese Democratic Party headed by Wade and his allies, is confident of victory in the legislative elections, in which seventeen parties and coalitions are taking part.</seg>

<seg id="12">In an effort to make the leaders of the opposition, grouped in the Front "Siggil Senegal" (for the advancement of Senegal) Coalition, which includes seventeen parties, re-think their position on the boycott, members of civil society and many foreign dignitaries tried several times to mediate between the authority and the opposition.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the "Jordan Times" newspaper quoted the Secretary of the Commission, Moamen Al Hadidi, who said that "the authorities uncovered 81 cases of transplants in recent months," adding that a number of Jordanians were arrested in May (May) for encouraging people to sell their kidneys to clients outside of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="3">He said, "These people work on the basis of a commission and they target the poor in order to persuade them to sell their kidneys and they facilitate their travel outside the country to a third country where the operations are conducted."</seg>
<seg id="4">He added that "most donors were between twenty to forty years old, and were lured by the idea of rapidly gaining money," adding that one kidney is sold for 3,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al Hadidi said that most of those who sold their kidneys are poor and unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="6">It should be noted that organ transplant operations are banned in Jordan, and those who violate the law face a prison sentence of five years and a fine estimated at 20,000 dinars (28,000 dollars).</seg>

<seg id="4">The spokesman said, "We are dealing with people who are probably dangerous; they throw stones." He pointed out that "the police used water cannons to keep them away from the barrier that they approached."</seg>
<seg id="5">He added that "the total number of protesters is about 9,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="6">An official at the anti-globalization "G8-Block" said that police used tear gas, along with water cannons, to disperse the demonstrators, something that was not confirmed by police.</seg>
<seg id="7">The demonstration led to the closure of a police crossing after protesters cut a number of roads near the barrier, which is up to 12 kilometers long, in addition to cutting the coastal railway, which was being used to transport journalists from the Information Center located in Kuehlungsborn, a distance of a few hundred meters from Heiligendamm.</seg>
<seg id="8">Media representatives had to get on board German navy boats that took them to the summit location, while a number of helicopters conducted surveillance of the area from the air.</seg>

<seg id="2">A diplomatic source said that French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner will visit Sudan Monday to hold talks with the authorities in Khartoum, which will focus on the situation in Darfur, as part of an African tour that he will start on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The source said that Kouchner will meet with "the Sudanese authorities" to discuss with them "bilateral relations, regional issues and the situation in Darfur," without clarifying whether he would meet Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said it was not suggested currently that Kouchner would visit Darfur in western Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="5">The French minister has made the issue of Darfur his "priority" since his appointment less than three weeks ago, but it seems as if he backed down on Wednesday from the idea of a "humanitarian corridor" coming from Chad to assist the civilian population.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kouchner, who supports the principle of "intervention for humanitarian reasons," admitted on Wednesday that he was not "completely sure" of the possibility of establishing a humanitarian corridor coming from Chad, adding that the corridor, whose establishment is under discussion would, in any event, merely be an "air" bridge.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Thursday, Kouchner begins an African tour that will take him first to Mali, where, on Friday, he will attend the inauguration ceremony of Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré, and he will also seize the opportunity of his presence in Bamako to meet a number of African presidents.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kouchner will visit Chad on Saturday and Sunday, heading to the east of the country on Saturday to discuss the status of displaced persons and refugees, according to the source.</seg>

<seg id="2">The request was filed by Deputies Muslim Al Barak, Adel Al Sara'awi, and Abdullah al-Roumi, who represent various opposition blocs and demand the sacking of the minister, who is a member of the Kuwaiti ruling family.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is expected that the questioning will be discussed on June (June) 25, according to the regulations of the Kuwaiti parliament, and the questioning may turn into a confidence motion.</seg>
<seg id="4">If the Parliament withholds confidence from the Oil Minister, he would become automatically all but resigned. One of the Deputies who filed the request for questioning said, "We refuse to accept that the Minister might stay in office because we believe that Sheikh Ali's staying would represent a danger to the vital oil sector."</seg>
<seg id="5">Sheikh Ali, in press statements, praised the former Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, knowing that this Minister was accused by the government in a corruption case, something he completely denies.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah said that he considers his predecessor to be his teacher, and he asks for his advice from time to time in oil matters.</seg>

<seg id="3">Gordon Brown, who is expected to succeed Blair as prime minister on June (June) 27, said the memorandum was inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brown said in an interview with the British television network "Sky News" during his visit to Iraq on Monday, "This is not the right time to even think about an investigation, when the aim is to unify all efforts to support our troops on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Conservative Party's spokesman for foreign affairs, William Haig, rejected this argument.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "It is not true that the morale of our troops would decline or that our enemies will get a boost if we sought to discover what we did wrong."</seg>
<seg id="7">He added, "In a democratic society, the study of failure and success is an indicator of strength, not weakness."</seg>
<seg id="8">The memorandum stipulated that those who were political decision-makers and military officials be questioned before the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="5">The launching of the two rockets, in the first operation of this kind since the war between the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and the Israeli army in July (July) and August (August) 2006, led to the escalation of tension in Lebanon at a time when a wave of attacks are being witnessed and heavy clashes are taking place between the army and the guerrillas of the Fatah al-Islam group in the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp in the north.</seg>

<seg id="2">Potsdam (Germany) June 22, 2007 (AFP) - Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, finds himself now facing the task of reforming what can be reformed after the collapse of nearly six years of negotiations on the liberalization of world trade, which became more evident with the failure of talks between the four parties confronting each other on this issue, Brazil, India, the United States, and the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former European Commissioner was appointed to head the World Trade Organization in 2005 because of his presumed ability to conclude the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lamy was considered one of the main architects of the "Doha round" when it was launched in the year 2001 in the Qatari capital, in addition to his American counterpart Robert Zoellick, who was recently appointed as president of the World Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamy will hold a meeting on Friday for the 150 member-states of the Organization at its headquarters in Geneva to examine the developments one day after the failure of the "Group of Four" in Potsdam (Germany), following two and a half days of wrangling between the Americans and the Europeans on one side, and the Brazilians and Indians on the other.</seg>

<seg id="2">The President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski, the twin brother of Jaroslaw, is participating in the Brussels summit.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a morning meeting between the Polish president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Polish diplomats said that no progress was made on the issue of a qualified majority voting system, which threatens to topple the entire European Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Jaroslaw Kaczynski gave a different impression from Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Polish Prime Minister told reporters, "Some of our proposals were accepted, at least by the Germans."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The difference between Poland and Germany is no longer very big. There are problems with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="7">Poland thinks that the qualified majority voting system described in the constitutional Treaty gives a lot of weight to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Treaty states that decisions shall be taken by a majority of 55% of the votes of member states, on the condition that these countries represent 65% of the population of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Instead of this system, Poland proposed to adopt a "square root" formula for the calculation of the population of each State of the Union, arguing that this formula is more just. Jaroslaw Kaczynski said, "What we simply want is moderation.</seg>
<seg id="10">If there is no agreement on the square root, another form of moderation can be found."</seg>
<seg id="11">A Polish diplomat said on Friday morning in Brussels that Poland was not in a hurry to reach an agreement on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to the "growing interest" of the other member states in its position, the European summit will conclude on Friday without reaching an understanding, "but this subject should be discussed again within six months."</seg>

<seg id="3">Following further consultations, the American deputy ambassador, Alejandro Wolff, said in a press statement that the fifteen members of the Security Council had "a good discussion" and decided to pursue negotiations at the expert level on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Security Council on Wednesday, the United States, Britain, and France offered a new draft resolution that proposed a suspension, for a period of 120 days, of the process that is supposed to lead to the independence of Kosovo under the auspices of the United Nations, and to hold new discussions between the Serbs and the Albanian residents of Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id="5">This new text, which mentions the seventh chapter of the Charter of the United Nations (used in the event of a threat to international peace and security), demands that the parties "refrain from making any one-sided statements regarding the final status of Kosovo during this period." But Russia rejected it because it is opposed to "automatic" independence for Kosovo if no agreement is reached at the end of 120 days on the question of the province's status.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the new text "does not make it possible to get close to an acceptable agreement," saying that "there can be no real negotiations between the parties if the Ahtisaari plan is applied at the end of the 120 days automatically."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sarkozy said in a speech at the Le Bourget Exhibition for the Aviation and Space Industries, near Paris, that "Europe, with defense budgets that remain as a whole significantly lower than the American budget, is no longer able to cope with the consequences of five surface-to-air missile programs, three fighter aircraft programs, six attack submarine programs, and more than twenty armored vehicle programs."</seg>
<seg id="3">He pointed out, in particular, the concurrence of the European Union's programs of the Eurofighter, which the European group EADS had accomplished, and the Rafale aircraft, which was produced by the French group Dassault, and the Swedish Gripen Program.</seg>
<seg id="4">European industry is still very fragmented, despite the creation of EADS in the year 2000, and this week the presidents of the French company Thales and the Italian Finmeccanica expressed hope for "more political support," in particular for the creation of electronic defense conglomerates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sarkozy said that "the future is with joint programs and European integration in the field of industry, and I think the two should be combined."</seg>
<seg id="6">He added, "I will, in my capacity as the commander of the armies, ensure that the division of labor in Europe means that each country offers the best it has in terms of technologies, rather than consolidate its points of weakness."</seg>

<seg id="5">The Arab peace initiative offers Israel the normalization of its relations with the Arab countries in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territory occupied in June (June) 1967.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the bilateral level, the Yemeni president welcomed "French investments in our country, which will have every support and facilitation."</seg>

<seg id="4">The Secretary-=General of the Council of Arab Interior Ministers, Mohammed bin Ali Kuman, pointed out at the opening of the meeting that "the Internet has become an important tool in the hands of drug gangs."</seg>
<seg id="5">He pointed out that "a recent study of the World Health Organization reports that approximately 90% of Internet pharmacies provide narcotic drugs without a prescription" and the same is true of the so-called "Internet doctors," calling for "the need to create the technical and legal means to disrupt" such sites.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kuman stressed that "the seriousness of the drug phenomenon increased because of the close association between them and the crime of terrorism," and he expressed concern about "the role of drug money in the financing of terrorist gangs."</seg>
<seg id="7">He called on Arab states to give "greater attention to the technical and scientific sides in the security sphere, and to provide the qualified human resources, the equipment, and the data needed to stop money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="8">He also called on "social and religious organizations, and civil society to undertake comprehensive awareness-raising campaigns among the youth as the group most vulnerable to this phenomenon."</seg>

<seg id="3">He added that the continuous efforts made by Egypt for the past sixteen years and the efforts of the League of Arab States recently to promote national reconciliation in Somalia show clearly that the Arab side can contribute effectively through a neutral role and a full understanding of the complexities of the crisis to assist Somalia out of its ordeal,</seg>

<seg id="1">The current events in the Palestinian territories confirm that Israel is the sole beneficiary of the current situation, which arose from the Hamas movement's seizure of the headquarters of the security services in the Gaza Strip, and the subsequent resolutions of the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen). That led to the emergence of two competing entities, neither of which could impose its control on the other, due to the lack of geographic continuity between them, in addition to Israel's own unwillingness to allow one of the two powers to move to eliminate the other, which is something that Israel is expected to work to strengthen because it serves its strategic interests and achieves its old dream.</seg>
<seg id="2">And if we go back a bit, and specifically to December 18, 2005, we will easily discover the validity of this perception.

<seg id="2">In this context, the issue of intellectual and organizational reviews, which the Egyptian Jihad group is about to announce any day, and earlier broader and deeper reviews, which the Islamic group launched a decade ago, raises</seg>
<seg id="3">real questions about its future and its impact on the phenomenon of religious violence in Egypt and in the world, about which the use of the adjective "jihadist" is agreed upon, for it and for its perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="4">The key question that expectations and fears regarding the future revolve around is: Will those reviews lead to halting or reducing the practice of religious violence, or terrorism, from which Egypt has suffered for many years and from which the world is still suffering today? Or will their impact be limited and the suffering continue?</seg>
<seg id="5">The truth is that the answer to this question, the guess, conceals a part of it in the question itself, where the distinction between the future of this phenomenon of violence in Egypt and outside Egypt is considered the first entry for both the answer and the guess.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reviews initiated by the Islamic Group in Egypt with its declaration of an initiative to stop violence ten years ago on July 5, 1997, have already led to all the practices and manifestations of religious violence on the part of the group, ceasing completely throughout this period in this country, without a single exception, starting from the massacre in Al Barr Al Gharbi in Luxor, which was committed by members of the group on November 17, 1997, who were not informed of the initiative of their leaders and their decision to stop the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The importance of these ten years of complete cessation of violence is that they represent in the group's age of more than three decades, more than a third of it, and not just a short time out of it, which some might believe to be an exception to a long history, or a short truce that will end soon.</seg>

<seg id="3">Mr. Ayadi asserted that the symposium will issue the "Statement of Carthage," which will be given by the participating bodies and organizations to the Head of the Federation to present at a conference in India next November.</seg>
<seg id="4">For her part, Ms. Claudia Morrell, Director of the Center for Women and Technology at the American University of Maryland, mentioned the honor she was given by being among the participants in the symposium in Tunisia.</seg>
<seg id="5">She mentioned that she met many Tunisian women and engineers, whom she considered lucky and not suffering from any sexual discrimination and segregation.</seg>
<seg id="6">She added that the goal of this symposium is the same as the goal of the organization she heads, which is to encourage women's role in the fields of engineering and technology.</seg>
<seg id="7">For his part, Mr. Tony Marjoram, the UNESCO representative, mentioned that among the goals of his organization are justice and equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="8">He added that women's participation is very important for justice and equality between them and men, and that women's current participation in the field of engineering is much greater than their number in the 80s and the 90s, but the number started to witness a gradual decline in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">He pointed out the importance of finding the reasons behind the reluctance of young men, and women particularly, to join engineering specialties and added that the UNESCO organization is interested in this issue.</seg>

<seg id="1">The American President, George Bush, announced on May (May) 24 a new series of economic sanctions on Iran, after a report of the International Atomic Energy Agency was released a day earlier about increasing Uranium enrichment in Iran and Tehran's lack of cooperation with the international agency.</seg>
<seg id="2">This announcement coincided with a statement from his ambassador at the United Nations on the same day that there are disagreements in the Security Council, which prevent the implementation of previous resolutions on boycotting Iran.</seg>
<seg id="3">Actually, American sanctions on Iran date back to the early 80s, when American companies were banned from working in oil there, which was followed by congressional legislation in the year 1996, "The Law of Economic Sanctions against Iran and Libya," which imposed sanctions on foreign companies (non- American) that invest more than 20 million dollars per year in the oil industry in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="4">Libya was exempted from these sanctions after settling the conflict over blowing up the American plane over Lockerbie, in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's clear that the United States has not succeeded so far in undermining the Iranian oil industry, as happened with Iraq in the 90s of the past century.</seg>
<seg id="6">But what has been achieved is using constant pressure to limit the natural growth of this industry and its return to its previous levels before the revolution of 1979.</seg>
<seg id="7">As is known, Iranian oil production capacity under the late Shah of Iran reached almost 6 million barrels a day, only to drop during the Iran-Iraq war to almost 2.6 million barrels a day, then to increase to 4 million barrels a day now.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, import capacity has remained unchanged for many years. It reaches about 2.5 million barrels a day. In the previous Iranian fiscal year, total oil revenue reached about 54 billion dollars.</seg>

<seg id="2">The radio reported that Mofaz told Rice that "Hezbollah" returned to southern Lebanon on the same scale as before the war, but without the appearance of its men along the border.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added, according to the radio, that the United Nations peacekeepers and the Lebanese army are not doing anything to disarm "Hezbollah."</seg>
<seg id="4">The radio quoted sources at the Israeli embassy that diplomats at the embassy are criticizing Mofaz for ruling out a military attack on Iran and saying that the potential to influence it by diplomatic means was not yet exhausted.</seg>

<seg id="6">Under the title "Beersheba in the range of Hezbollah," a report published in the newspaper "Yedioth Ahronoth" said that Mofaz told Rice that Syria and Iran, after the Second Lebanon War, smuggled to "Hezbollah" missiles that can reach population centers in central Israel and part of the south.</seg>
<seg id="7">It added that Mofaz was quoting "reliable" intelligence information, which Israel obtained.</seg>

<seg id="2">Khoja's communications with all parties come in the context of urging them to agree on a memorandum of understanding, especially since Saudi Arabia remains the country that is most able to be open for all and this time is supported by the ambassador of France, Bernard Emie, and that of Iran, Mohammad-Reza Sheibani,</seg>

<seg id="4">But Khoja is keen, as visitors have quoted him, to stress that he does not have a political initiative on behalf of his country, and that all that matters to him is that the parties reach an agreement that accelerates the production of a national unity government, from the womb of the current government.</seg>

<seg id="3">But he did not disclose the contents of these communications and how they are proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mofaz, the defense minister, former army chief, and member of Israel's mini-cabinet security, was commenting on the information published the day before yesterday by the Israeli newspaper "Yedioth Ahronoth," which wrote that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently told Syria through confidential letters that he was ready to resume dialogue with them and withdraw from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the year 1967 and annexed in the year 1981, in exchange for peace.</seg>
<seg id="5">It said that Olmert said in one of his letters, "I am aware that any peace agreement with Syria will force me to return the Golan Heights to Syrian sovereignty, and I am ready to assume my responsibilities for the establishment of peace between us."</seg>
<seg id="6">It added that these letters were sent to President Bashar al-Asad through Turkish and German officials.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mofaz said, "Given the tension that currently prevails (between the two sides) and the recent pro-peace statements of Syria, I was thinking</seg>

<seg id="1">In a development related to the escalation of conflict between the institution of the Turkish army and the government led by the (Islamic) "Justice and Development" Party, against the background of the crisis of the candidacy for the post of President of the Republic, the Turkish government embarked on the removal of its country's envoy to the Joint Committee (with the United States) to combat terrorism, retired General Edip Baser.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the same time, the Government announced that it decided to appoint a senior official in the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, diplomat Refaat Aq Jonai, to the same committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">It should be noted that this committee, which specializes in the activities of the "Kurdistan Workers Party" outside Turkish borders, was formed due to an American proposal more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">In that period, Washington made clear that the objective of the establishment of the committee is to assist Turkey in pursuing the terrorist groups that target it. But those close to the political circle in Ankara confirmed that the real objective is to convince Ankara not to invade Iraqi Kurdistan to hunt down "Workers Party" fighters who have taken parts of the rugged mountainous terrain on the Iraqi-Iranian border as a haven for their activities, and to rather look for non-military solutions in cooperation with the Iraqis and the Kurdish leaders in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's worth mentioning that Ankara made, at the time, a series of threats to invade Iraqi Kurdistan to hunt down "Workers Party" fighters. But the Kurdish leadership in Iraq replied that it would not stand idle in the face of any Turkish military incursion, but rather would consider it an act of occupation and would call on the Kurds to resist it with arms.</seg>
<seg id="6">And since Iraqi Kurdistan forms the only safe spot in a chaotic Iraq, the United States was quick to persuade Ankara to abandon its military threats and to resort to peaceful solutions based on the principle of cooperation with Iraq's Kurds in order to remove the fighters from their strongholds and put an end to their armed operations.</seg>

<seg id="1">It became calm in the Gaza Strip after six days of fierce fighting between supporters of the "Fatah" and "Hamas" Movements, which led to the deaths of at least 116 people and 550 wounded, and ended with the announcement by "Hamas" that it had taken full control of Gaza. This is what forced the international community, represented by the International Quartet Committee, to declare full support for President Mahmoud Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="2">Nevertheless, Washington denied having any intention to cut emergency aid to the Gaza Strip or "to make a separation in its handling of Gaza and the West Bank," declaring that it was considering a series of options to deal with recent developments, including the strengthening of Abbas by achieving progress in the peace process and improving conditions in the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="3">For its part, the Israeli government chose to "wait, observe, and prepare," although the events in Gaza have stepped up its approval of the appointment of Ehud Barak as Defense Minister, while the Chairman of the Political Bureau of "Hamas", Khaled Meshaal, placed "primary responsibility" on the international community for the crisis between "Fatah" and "Hamas."</seg>
<seg id="4">Parallel to this, the Palestinian President assigned Finance Minister Salam Fayyad with forming an "emergency government," after he announced the dissolution of the unity government. This is an assignment that "Hamas" deemed unconstitutional and a "violation of all the laws."</seg>

<seg id="2">Emirati expert Ayman Saif told "Al-Hayat" that "the charges of price manipulation submitted by Democrat Herb Kohl and Republican Arlen Specter, and approved by the American Senate, are not directed against members of the organization only, but against all oil producers in the world."</seg>

<seg id="4">Saif does not believe that American President George W.

Also, it does not take into account countries' sovereignty and independence, which is a dangerous precedent that did not happen before.</seg>
<seg id="5">Saif asserted that "demanding such a law is not new. It started for the first time in the year 1978 when a workers' group demanded the prosecution of 'OPEC' under the Anti-Monopoly Act, but an American Court of Appeals rejected the case in the year 1981 on the basis that members of the organization enjoyed immunity from lawsuits because their decisions are the decisions of sovereign states. Then came the second attempt, in the year 2005, but the case was dropped before it was voted on."</seg>
<seg id="6">Saif said that "those who should be prosecuted are the major oil companies (most of which are American) for their monopoly on exploration and refining technology."</seg>
<seg id="7">Also speculators in world oil markets are the ones who raise its prices, not producing countries, since the high price is not the result of the lack of supply, but the inability of refiners in America to produce what can meet market demand there.</seg>

<seg id="8">A similar American attitude came from American Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who said, "We prefer to continue working on solving this problem with them to try to ensure Turkey's security, and we hope they will not carry out unilateral military action across their borders with Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that "the Turks have real concerns because of Kurdish terrorism that is happening on Turkish territories, and one can understand the frustration and resentment they feel because of that."</seg>

<seg id="1">In the first attack of its kind since June 25, 2006, the date of the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Palestinian activists stormed an Israeli military site at the Kissufim border crossing, after they infiltrated inside Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. This led to the outbreak of a battle in which one of the attackers was killed.</seg>
<seg id="2">The joint attack, named "the Hot Summer," took place in broad daylight and was carried out by the "Al Quds Brigades," the military wing of the "Islamic Jihad" movement, and the "al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades" of the "Fatah" Movement.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesman for the unit of the "al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades," named Abu Ali, announced that activists riding a Jeep with the United Nations emblem on it stormed the crossing gate.</seg>
<seg id="4">He added that mortars and rockets were used to provide a cover for them.</seg>
<seg id="5">The spokesman of the "Al Quds Brigades," Abu Ahmad, asserted "that the operation was unique and complicated. The main gate of Kissufim crossing was stormed using an armored four-wheel car that was detonated. Then four martyrs entered and clashed with the occupation soldiers in the area."</seg>
<seg id="6">He pointed out that "six groups fired mortars in the direction of the site."</seg>
<seg id="7">And he said that "three martyrs came back safely after carrying out the operation," confirming that "the operation was filmed."</seg>
<seg id="8">And he announced the death of Muhammad Khalil Al Ja'abari from Al Shujaiyah neighborhood in East Gaza, who was killed by Israeli fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">And he spoke about one Israeli soldier killed and others wounded, but the army denied that.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Israeli Army asserted that the Jeep that was used in the attack carried the two letters "T.V.," an abbreviation of the word television, whereas Abu Ali said it was carrying the United Nations emblem.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judicial sources said the Egyptian Prosecutor-General yesterday referred seven people, including a member of the People's Assembly, to the criminal court for their involvement in the supply of blood bags, in violation of the specifications of the Ministry of Health and Population.</seg>
<seg id="2">A source said that prosecutors charged the seven with racketeering and fraud in the supply of blood bags. They included a member of the People's Assembly, Hani Sorour, the owner of the company that supplied the bags and the Chairman of its board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added that the others were four company officials, including Sorour's sister who occupies the post of Member of the appointed board of directors, and two officials of the Ministry of Health and Population.</seg>
<seg id="4">The People's Assembly in January (January) agreed to lift Sorour's parliamentary immunity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sorour, and the other six, faced an inquiry by the Supreme Public Money Prosecutor on the discovery of thousands of bags of blood not conforming to specifications, which were supplied by the company in stores belonging to the Ministry of Health and Population, after complaints received by regulators from a number of public hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the decision to refer them, the prosecutors said that the two officials at the Ministry of Health approved the bags (containers) of blood without a technical test, and only did a superficial examination.</seg>
<seg id="7">They added that deficiencies were uncovered in the bags of blood, which led to donors' losing consciousness because of the increase in the blood flow rate above the natural rate, caused blood clots, and caused the bags to burst during the separation of blood components.</seg>
<seg id="8">They added that the defects in the bags caused the infiltration of bacteria into the blood of the patients (who were injected with blood) and gave them bacterial poisoning that can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="9">Egyptian newspapers said that employees in the Ministry of Health and Population may have been involved in receiving the bags, in return for privileges from the company's owner.</seg>

<seg id="1">The British daily newspaper, The Guardian, and television station, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), surprised the whole world by publishing details of the bribes and commissions received by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, former Saudi ambassador to Washington and General Secretary of the Saudi National Security Council, in the context of the Al Yamamah arms deal, which the Saudi government purchased from Britain and was worth 43 billion pounds sterling, which is the equivalent of 80 billion dollars. It included the purchase of Tornado and Hawk aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2">There are many details on how these commissions and bribes were paid, and have become well known. And perhaps they will be better explained, with audio and video, when the BBC broadcasts its television program, which includes the result of investigations and interviews to know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is unknown, at least to the Arab reader, is the party that stands behind this disclosure and leak of the information to the media, and the reasons that led to that.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before answering this question, we must go backward a little, and specifically to the personal intervention of Tony Blair, Britain's Prime Minister, to suspend the investigations that were conducted by an independent judicial commission into the deal and its commissions. This came after Saudi Arabia threatened to cut off relations with Britain, to stop its cooperation in the war on terror, and to withdraw from a deal for new arms that it intends to purchase from Britain, with a total value of 70 billion dollars, and that include modern Eurofighter aircrafts.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tony Blair, who will leave his post in nearly two weeks, said he bears the personal responsibility for making this decision, because the continuation of investigations will disclose results that would threaten British national security, and damage relations with an allied state that participated actively in the wars on terror and Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Observer newspaper's edition yesterday, Sunday, revealed that Tony Blair approved the involvement of British troops in the Iraq war while fully aware that Washington had not made the appropriate preparations for the post-war period and for reconstruction operations in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2">The newspaper said that senior aides to the British Prime Minister and close friends confirmed that Blair repeatedly expressed his concerns to the White House on this issue, but without success.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also agreed to involve British troops in the Iraq war, despite the fact that President George Bush personally announced that Britain could help in other ways.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper pointed out that this disclosure, which came in a documentary that Channel 4 television will air next Saturday in two episodes, raises many questions about the guarantees given by Blair to the British public at the outbreak of war in March (March) 2003, that he was satisfied with the plans for the post-war period in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="5">A statement in the program attributed to Peter Mandelson, a former minister in Blair's government, stated that the Prime Minister (Blair) was aware that the preparations for the post-war period in Iraq were not appropriate, but he was not able to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="6">For his part, Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former special representative in Iraq, stressed that Blair was in a state of despair, and was pulling his hair out because of some of the shortcomings and defects.</seg>
<seg id="7">Greenstock stressed that the failure to make the required preparation led to the quick collapse of things in Iraq, and he said, "I felt that this country was slipping from our hands from the beginning; there was no security force to control the streets and no police force to speak of."</seg>

<seg id="2">It is not reasonable that these states would show their obedience, swear this obedience to America, and do assignments by heart that matches American requirements.</seg>
<seg id="3">Iran, for example, has more than one card to play in bargaining with the sponsor, including its unsolved nuclear issue, its ability to curb armed militias in Iraq, and its impact on the decisions of important groups in the political process.</seg>

<seg id="1">Al-Jazeera satellite television channel said that the Minister of Communications and Parliamentary Affairs of Kuwait, Sharida Al-Maousherji, resigned Tuesday amid a dispute between the Council of Ministers and the Council of the Nation on a proposed vote to withdraw confidence from the oil minister.</seg>
<seg id="2">Al-Maousherji's aforementioned resignation came a day after the proposal of ten deputies to withdraw confidence from Oil Minister Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah, based on his qualifications for the post.</seg>
<seg id="3">Al-Arabiya Satellite channel also reported the news of the resignation of Al-Maousherji, but the reason of this step was not immediately clear.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many think that Al-Maousherji is a member of the Salafi Bloc that called for the resignation of the oil minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">The government has repeatedly said that it supports the oil minister. Changes in leadership positions in the oil ministry do not usually affect general oil policy, where final decisions are made by a government committee.</seg>
<seg id="6">Parliament members directed scathing criticism at the oil minister, a member of the royal family, because of comments he made in the Qabas newspaper, in which he said he had asked the advice of Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, a former oil minister that was investigated in a scandal of illicit gain.</seg>
<seg id="7">Deputy Abdullah Al Roumi told Reuters that the minister's statement in the Qabas newspaper was a powerful shock to everyone who read it in the political and judicial context.</seg>

<seg id="2">The United States today, /Monday/, handed over a report to the World Trade Organization proposing tougher regulations for government subsidies that damage trade.</seg>
<seg id="3">The United States Trade Representative, Susan C. Schwab, said, "It is time to take the next step in developing stronger regulations for the World Trade Organization, which will curb the use of governmental industrial subsidies."</seg>
<seg id="4">She added, "The subsidies that we want to ban keep inefficient production capacity in industries ranging from steel to semiconductors.</seg>
<seg id="5">And the practices of many of our trade partners that lead, mostly, to unfair trade and that damage trade will face tougher regulations on these kinds of subsidies."</seg>
<seg id="6">These negotiations are being held in the framework of the Doha Development Agenda, based on the statement released by the American Trade Representative's office.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American proposal will ban the following five types of subsidies if they were "limited," and which are given only to a certain company or industry and assist a product that is exported or competes with imports:</seg>
<seg id="8">-- covering operating losses;</seg>
<seg id="9">-- dropping government debt;</seg>
<seg id="10">-- lending to "insolvent" companies;</seg>
<seg id="11">-- indirect investment in "unfair" companies;</seg>
<seg id="12">-- other financing, like financing "based on a concession fee" that is not available commercially.</seg>
<seg id="13">The American government also suggested additional measures for the transparency of the World Trade Organization, which would be applied to state-owned companies and governmental subsidies to this kind of company, as the statement said. But the newly proposed subsidies regulations will not apply to the agricultural sector.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, developing states demanded from the United States and the European Union a substantial reduction in agricultural subsidies to help break the deadlock in global trade talks.</seg>

<seg id="7">so imagine someone holding 100,000 shares in it and how much his losses would be in this short time, let alone if he owned more,</seg>
<seg id="8">and you can apply this to many of the shares, but these were the ones I could remember from this stupid market.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am not talking here about the fall in the indicator and prices since it reached 20966 points. I am talking about the period of three weeks only.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investment funds that are supposed to at least preserve the capital, if they make no profit, lost much of their value leading some to lose as much as 75 percent of their capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">Al-Raed Fund had reached 97 riyal per unit and now is in the low thirties as far as I know, so what kind of investment is this?</seg>
<seg id="12">Asayel Fund's original unit price was one riyal, and people fought over them to invest in it, and now the unit is nearly a quarter of a riyal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Due to the occurrence of some embezzlement and fraud incidents, or robbery using force and sometimes weapons, and sometimes murder of some Saudi tourists in the recent past, and especially after the Syrian army existed Lebanon, there is lots of talk and warnings against traveling to Syria, and especially on this forum.</seg>
<seg id="2">And I see that it sometimes exceeds the limits of the incident, that is, warning against traveling for tourism to Syria, to attacking the Syrians and making the Syrian people, or a majority of them, happy with what is happening to tourists, or at least with the Syrian Government's policy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bad and evil people exist in every place on earth, in Saudi Arabia, in Syria, everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">We in this country, Saudi Arabia, have many security problems.</seg>
<seg id="5">But we got used to shining the light on others and forgetting about ourselves and the problems we suffer from.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whoever wants to verify what I write, let him go and sit for only an hour at the police station nearest to his house, and watch the amount of complaints, disputes, stolen rights, thefts, and others..</seg>
<seg id="7">This despite that the state has recently become aware of this failing in security that has been ignored for years given that security authorities were focusing solely on terrorism,</seg>
<seg id="8">Proof of this are the large numbers of amputated hands this month to get rid of the spreading theft which has unfortunately become a widespread phenomenon everywhere in the Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">So if in a country as rich as Saudi Arabia we suffer from widespread theft, secretly, under duress and sometimes using force, should we blame a whole poor nation just because it has a few criminals amongst it?</seg>

<seg id="4">We won't go far and we won't leave the borders of this homeland in defining the features of this embarrassing and shameful breakdown in the face of an issue that, when it first appeared, we used to describe as totally alien to our social and cultural reality.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some of us even reached the state of saying that those Saudi terrorists were a misled bunch who did not derive their extremist excommunication ideas and approach from the culture of the society.</seg>
<seg id="6">The riffraff among the Saudi society lived strongly convinced that the prodigal bunch had no ideological and religious origins and starting points to feed its ideas and push it into the fire and hell of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="7">So people rejoiced with each security success in which terrorist fell like moths into the lamplight.</seg>
<seg id="8">The embers of terrorist fire were not extinguished despite brilliant security successes, and despite the great support given to the counseling project, which targeted many of those detained in terrorism cases.</seg>
<seg id="9">Saudi society was shaken by the terrorist acts, and sustained material and intellectual damage at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we are now witnessing this violence and intellectual conflict between a large number of  ideological movements' icons, exchanging accusations, accusing of collaboration with foreign states and accusing some proselytizers of supporting terrorism and extremists.</seg>
<seg id="11">The content of the latest announcement from the Ministry of Interior about detaining a group of those who provide ideological and material support to terrorists clearly reflects the dimension of the tragedy we are living in</seg>

<seg id="2">The media campaign against the Authority now looks like the media campaign against Iraq regarding the weapons of mass destruction..</seg>
<seg id="3">Everyone knew that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, but with time and the continual and organized pressure by the media, an almost absolute conviction was born inside people's minds of the necessity to occupy Iraq!!</seg>
<seg id="4">And now, whoever organized this campaign against the Authority is not aiming at exposing the faults of the Authority or settling personal accounts; the aims are farther than that.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim is creating an internal conviction among people to give the Authority up. This of course requires a massive media effort, and presently you see their daily desperate media efforts!!</seg>
<seg id="6">So now, with God's help, I am going to say what I have to say: does the Authority err?</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes. The Authority is full of errors from top to bottom. And we won't even go into the boring details that people talk of.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main errors, as I have seen with my own eyes, are that many of the men in the Authority, who deal directly with the public, seem to have been chosen for their devoutness, God knows.</seg>
<seg id="9">An important angle concerning psychological and social aspects was ignored, that is, how to deal with the public. For at issue are not rules to be implemented, but winning the public over..</seg>
<seg id="10">In my opinion it is better that someone goes to the mosque voluntarily instead of being forced to do so after being flogged and humiliated. You can measure all the errors of the Authority and the aversion of many to it accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many of the men working in the Hisba have to understand that their work is not related to laws and regulations that must be implemented as much as it is to win the public's affection and conviction.</seg>

<seg id="3">At a time when the number of countries that have abolished the death penalty reached 128 countries**</seg>
<seg id="4">In one of the most important countries of the Arab world the most horrible crime has occurred: the execution of three heads of the former Iraqi regime</seg>
<seg id="5">The Criminal Court of Iraq ordered the execution of (Ali Hassan Abdel Magid, known as "chemical Ali", Sultan Hashim al-Tai and Hussein Rashid al-Tikriti** )</seg>
<seg id="6">In the light of calls from many members of the international and Arab community for the abolition of the death penalty, especially for political and opinion crimes, the court sentence was issued in unnatural conditions and from a court affiliated to a regime that came about under the occupation.</seg>
<seg id="7">So the sentence is described as political in nature, and this scene has unfortunately happened before when the half brother of the deposed Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was executed, and also Awad Ahmad al-Bandar, the former head of the Revolutionary Court, who were sentenced to execution by hanging.</seg>
<seg id="8">Barzan al-Tikriti was executed in a way that breaches all international and humanitarian standards, and his head separated from his body and flew a distance of 30 meters**.</seg>
<seg id="9">This penalty, for whose abolition we call, is executed in a way that conflicts with international and humanitarian standards, which is what we noticed in the execution of the Iraqi president Saddam Hussein on the first day of the blessed Eid Al-Adha Feast last year causing consternation and sadness in the whole Arab world during that feast**.</seg>
<seg id="10">To ensure a just and fair trial, those accused of war crimes should have been tried before international criminal courts or the International Court of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Chief Editor of the ruling party's Al Baath newspaper, Elias Murad, expressed on Wednesday his astonishment that Syria would be immediately accused of assassinating Lebanese MP Walid Eido, at a time no accusations were made against movements pressured by the Lebanese Government, such as the Fatah Al Islam group.</seg>
<seg id="3">He indicated that he was not accusing that group.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with Al Arabiya satellite channel, Murad said that "stability in Lebanon is achieved by a national unity government, through which the security element can be better controlled.. and these assassination cases would become controllable and their perpetrators arrested."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Lebanese Future parliamentary block MP, Walid Eido, was killed earlier on Wednesday in an explosion that targeted his car, and also resulted in the death of his son and four other people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Minutes after the killing of MP Eido was confirmed, the anti-Syrian March 14 MPs accused Damascus of being behind the assassination.</seg>
<seg id="7">Murad said that "political assassination is not part of Syrian state policy.. and that Syria denies and condemns it."</seg>
<seg id="8">He deemed there to be "a security flaw in Lebanon that allows multiple groups to perpetrate such acts."</seg>
<seg id="9">He refused to accuse any specific group without there being an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Murad, who also chairs the Syrian Journalists' Union, expressed his astonishment that "there is a battle in the camps, and the Lebanese Government is currently fighting existing movements, but nevertheless no accusation was made against these movements,"</seg>
<seg id="11">mentioning that he was not accusing these movements, "but not a single word has been said about them."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp is witnessing very violent battles between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam militants,</seg>
<seg id="3">while Prime Minister Fouad Siniora called for the evacuation of civilians remaining in the camp in preparation for what seems to be the final strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">A military source described the fighting in Nahr al-Bared camp as more violent than usual, as the army engages for the forth consecutive week in battles with Fatah al-Islam group which is inspired in its approach by Al Qaeda organization.</seg>
<seg id="5">Over 136 people were killed, including 60 soldiers, in the most violent fighting since the civil war which occurred between 1975 and 1990, while 11 soldiers were killed and over a hundred injured during the battles at the start of the week.</seg>
<seg id="6">The army is clashing with Fatah al-Islam militants on the outskirts of the camp which used to shelter around 40,000 people prior to the start of fighting which forced thousands to escape, with the majority seeking refuge at the nearby al-Badawi camp. Evacuating the remaining refugees: Aid workers are struggling to evacuate civilians still besieged inside the camp,</seg>
<seg id="7">while the head of the Lebanese government Fouad Siniora demanded that civilians who have not left the camp yet needed to be evacuated "to protect their lives" in response "to the pleas they have made."</seg>
<seg id="8">But Siniora called for caution from "the possible movement of Fatah al-Islam elements and their exploitation of the evacuation operation, so that terrorist actions do not move beyond the camp."</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, the Palestinian Army denied news indicating that armed elements believed to be members of Fatah al-Islam organization had kidnapped two Lebanese soldiers from a street in Tripoli, and the demands by these elements of assured safe passage to the Syrian borders in exchange for the release of the two kidnapped soldiers, promising not to cause them any harm.</seg>

<seg id="2">The American film is threatened with disappearance from Egyptian cinemas, after being its king from the eighties till now, because of the appearance of new competitors promoting European, and especially French, films, as well as films from east Asia,</seg>
<seg id="3">as one of the major companies known for calculated and successful ventures obtained authorization to screen Indian films at the same time as they are screened in India,</seg>
<seg id="4">Opinions on this matter differ. The distributor of American films in Egypt, Antoine Zanad, assured that screening European, Indian and Korean films is nothing but a temporary phenomenon that will pass</seg>
<seg id="5">especially that it is managed haphazardly, and so won't survive the American film, nor shake its throne in the Egyptian cinemas.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zanad attributed the presence of Italian films in the sixties and Indian ones in the eighties to the fact that for the former, film distributors at that time were depending on the Italian community in Egypt, or on Egyptians of Italian origin</seg>
<seg id="7">and in the case of Indian films, they were more organized, as there was a specialized agent for this genre and when he died these films disappeared and did not have any presence at all after him.</seg>
<seg id="8">He assured that the American film won't be threatened by the "rage" of upcoming films, because it is haphazard and disorganized, and that it will remain on the throne of the foreign film in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Adil Adeeb, the managing director of Good News company, confirmed that he did in fact obtain an appointment as an agent for Indian films in Egypt, and that the Indian films are screened at the same time as they show in India, as organized with the Indian companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">A plan and a study of the movie market has been prepared, increasing marketing operations for the next three years, and there is a similar plan for the European and Korean films.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also, these films are shown in the cinemas owned by the company, which believes in opening new movie markets for this type of films.</seg>

<seg id="2">I believe that the United States of America stance on Muslim issues, starting with the issue of Kashmir, is a stance based on the "double standard" policy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The United States of America backs India despite its continuing rejection of international resolutions pertaining to the issue of Kashmir, and manipulating it for over half a century.</seg>
<seg id="4">Likewise, it backs the Zionist entity despite its continuing refusal to implement international resolutions on Palestine,</seg>
<seg id="5">The US government has not and will not pressure India in any way to resolve the issue of Kashmir in accordance with international resolutions, like it has not and will not pressure the Zionist entity to solve the Palestinian issue in accordance with international resolutions.</seg>
<seg id="6">As such, President Pervez Musharraf's call on the United States of America to assist in reaching a solution to the issue of Kashmir will not lead to any solutions for the issue*.</seg>
<seg id="7">What are the principles, or the axes on the basis of which you strive to solve the issue of Kashmir?**</seg>
<seg id="8">The resolution of the Kashmiri issue is based on two central axes: the first is the 1947 resolution to divide the South Asian Subcontinent, which stipulates the accession of the state of Jammu and Kashmir Pakistan on account of the state being mainly Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="9">The second are the international resolutions of 1948 and 1949, stipulating a referendum to determine the fate of the state - either accede to India, or to Pakistan.</seg>

<seg id="2">Adel al-Ansari is an Egyptian journalist, and owner of the Shuruq Media Services Company,</seg>
<seg id="3">It is obvious from the name of the company that the owner is not trading in contraband, or any drugs, whether that be rolls of hash or opium, or packets of marijuana that have devoured the brains of the Egyptian youth, and that his was not one of the  navigation companies specializing in transporting Egyptians into the afterworld by drowning them in the salty waters,</seg>
<seg id="4">The Shuruq Company was also not specializing in importing carcinogenic wheat, and al-Ansari did not trade in contaminated blood, and did not wrestle with folk to occupy their posts.</seg>
<seg id="5">So if that was the case, what was the security raid on his company, its closure and the eviction of the young people working in it about?</seg>
<seg id="6">Knowledgeable sources confirmed that the goal of closing down Shuruq Media Services came under the category of birth control!! When the Ministry of Health and Population found out that young people working in the company intended to get married, it immediately charged supervision and security authorities to take control of the situation and prevent these young people from concluding their marriages, by closing the only source of their livelihood and thus prevent them from reproducing, so the Prophet, peace be upon him, cannot rival other nations with them on the Day of the Resurrection.</seg>
<seg id="7">The closure occurred one day after 120 million pounds were allocated for birth control (refer to al-Ahram, p.1, date of the catastrophe/Naksa)</seg>
<seg id="8">Other sources confirmed that the closure of the Shuruq Media Services Company came as a result of company owner, Adel al-Ansari's, connections with foreign Sudanese, Saudi and Mauritanian entities!! When I asked the sources for further elucidation, they referred me to history books to find out the truth of what they allege.</seg>

<seg id="3">Three parliamentary blocks confirmed that the decree issued by the President on community societies and organizations sets a precedent, as in fact it nullified the Associations Act without announcing so, in addition to being a procedure that deeply affects democratic life in Palestine, and limits individual and collective freedoms to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa List, al-Badeel List and Independent Palestine-Palestinian National Initiative- List stated in a memorandum, a copy of which reached "Ma'an" news agency, "It is obvious that the decree oversteps all promulgated legislation ensuring the freedom of  organizations, corporations and associations in conducting their work, and gives the executive authorities unlimited jurisdiction to interfere in their affairs without any legal or practical procedural justification as stipulated by the Community Organizations and Associations Act 1, of the year 2000"</seg>
<seg id="5">The blocks added, "we have always been proud as Palestinians of the Community Organizations Act, as an expression -in text and spirit- of Palestinian democracy and the state of civil society for which the Act was an important strengthening factor, driving it forward through the establishment of a civilized and enlightened society."</seg>
<seg id="6">The blocks explained that, "we consider that the implementation of the decree in its issued form represents a huge setback for democracy in our country, and so we demand revoking this decree and suspending its implementation to safeguard democratic life in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The President of the National Palestinian Authority had issued a Presidential Decree containing a number of procedures related to the functioning of corporations, organizations and associations, that included granting the Minister of Interior absolute jurisdiction to review the work of associations and take whatever action he sees appropriate about them.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was pointed out that associations needed to reapply for licensing their functions to the Ministry of Interior.</seg>

<seg id="3">And what might be even stranger is that these cosmetic surgeries, which can cost as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars, are being financed through of loans by respectable banks in the country, such as the National Bank of Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="4">Reports state that the banks might receive over 200 phone enquiries per day about these loans, and these calls are answered by staff qualified in banking and cosmetic procedures that, it seems, are beginning "to change the face" of modern Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="5">It may be that the reality show, Beauty Clinic, screened recently on Lebanese Future TV, has encouraged many ladies to proceed with this experiment, even when the lady, girl or even young males do not suffer from any congenital defect or anything similar.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leila Obeid, the mind behind Beauty Clinic which is based on choosing a group of women suffering from psychological or social issues, said that over 10,000 women applied to participate in the program which was screened early this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The program tries -through a group of doctors and specialists- to perform a number of cosmetic procedures that help in "strengthening the morale of these ladies" and help them overcome issues, no matter how big.</seg>
<seg id="8">Speaking of this idea, Obeid says, "I support natural beauty.. just as I support cosmetic procedures that highlight the nature of female beauty."</seg>

<seg id="2">Current situations in Palestine are strange and unexpected, for as soon as the parties come close and agree on national unity and joint responsibility, something shows up to destroy it by mutual fighting and endless skirmishes from certain dissident entities within Fatah's security apparatuses.</seg>
<seg id="3">In my opinion, these are orders from big bosses, into which some criminal states on the international scene might interfere, starting with the USA and Israel.</seg>
<seg id="4">When you move between the Palestine Dialogue Forum, which is a forum for Hamas supporters, and the Fatahwiyeh (Fateh Forum) which is a forum for Fatah supporters, you would be astonished by the way some parties turn facts around.</seg>
<seg id="5">For Hamas, the dissidents are deemed Fatah's criminal faction, while on Fatah forums you find the dissidents to be Hamas and its government.</seg>

<seg id="7">Some people are displeased with the control of Hamas and its supporters over the security apparatuses, but whoever looks closely into the recent situations will have no doubt that these security apparatuses led by Dahlan wreaked havoc in the land and had repeatedly tried to assassinate the prime minister and Hamas ministers despite signing agreements and despite the pledge by all parties in Fatah not to harm Hamas' legitimacy or its men.</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems that Fatah's top men don't have control over dissident leaderships, and that despite all the slogans of unity and Fatah's participation in the Unity Government, the assassination series and the security chaos has obligated Hamas to fight corruption and to turn against dissidents and expel them from Gaza Strip after they trespassed all red and yellow lines.</seg>

<seg id="3">The B'Tselem organization lodged an application with the Israeli Ministry of Interior to disclose the number of Jerusalem residents whose residency has been withdrawn, as 222 resident had their residency withdrawn in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">It should be mentioned that Arab residents of Jerusalem were given permanent residency status that grants them most of the privileges that Israeli citizens enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Israeli law, the Hebrew state has the right to withdraw the residency of any Arab citizen in Jerusalem if he resides outside the country or within the areas of the Palestinian Authority.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israel adopted the policy of collective withdrawal of residency from groups of Jerusalem residents since 1995 during the times of the notorious Eli Suissa who occupied the post of Director of Jerusalem Bureau in the Israeli Ministry of Interior. Orders to cancel the residence of Jerusalem residents escalated when Suissa was appointed Minister representing the fundamentalist Shas Party in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="7">Suissa continued to place obstacles against Arab residents of Jerusalem who applied  for building permits, creating a terrible shortage in accommodation and thus forcing many to leave Jerusalem unwillingly.

<seg id="2">The basis of the function of all genes in mammals depends on a daily circadian rhythm.</seg>
<seg id="3">This study disproves the current theory which states that only 10 - 15% of the genes are affected by the natural clock.</seg>
<seg id="4">While it was known to scientists for a long time that the daily circadian rhythm, or the daily natural clock, regulates the behavior of living creatures, the study shows that this daily clock controls and manages all life functions, and manages especially metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="5">The knowledge of the circadian motion of genes that play part in metabolism is essential and fundamental to understanding the interaction of genes with, and the manner they organize health and illness.</seg>
<seg id="6">Researcher Ptitsen says, "For example, when following any dieting system, you know that you shouldn't eat anything late at night.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now we know why.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have discovered that all genes undergo qualitative changes in some type of activity throughout the day.</seg>
<seg id="9">And each path in the genetic activity is affected by the time of the day, or by the daily circadian rhythm.</seg>
<seg id="10">The timing and synchronization of this rhythm is important for each group of genes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers also discovered short and long versions of some genes that oscillate in the other direction.</seg>
<seg id="12">These genes are basic and essential compounds of the signaling system of the hormone leptine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Different organs vary in the pattern of oscillation,</seg>
<seg id="14">The effect of leptine determines the regulation of energy balance.</seg>
<seg id="15">The greater understanding of the nature of gene oscillation provides researchers with solutions to develop treatment methods for people who eat in excess of what their body needs because of imbalance in leptin signals.</seg>
<seg id="16">The daily circadian rhythm is the (music) of the vital biological harmony during a 24- hour period. It regulates the time and duration of most physiological and behavioral functions, such as sleep, food intake and activity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Parliamentary sources disclosed to the news today, Sunday 24 June 2007, a decision taken by the new Mauritanian authorities to close four important Mauritanian embassies overseas, the most prominent of which is the Mauritanian Embassy in Jordan, while the president had reservations against the closure of the embassy in Tel Aviv?</seg>
<seg id="3">The source said Parliament received confirmed information two days ago, stating that the President had decided to close the following Mauritanian embassies because of financial, not political, pressure: the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan, the Mauritanian embassy in Japan, the Mauritanian embassy in Britain, and the Mauritanian embassy in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, he refused to close the Mauritanian embassy in Tel Aviv -despite its financial cost reaching 20 million ouguiya in 2005- on account of its political nature which gave raise to much debate in the past years between opposition and government.</seg>
<seg id="5">The same sources said that a general trend within Parliament rejects this decision especially as the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan is more important, since there is a Mauritanian community in Jordan, mostly consisting of students.</seg>
<seg id="6">The economic activity and political nature of the embassy also makes its closure, while there is an ambassador in Tel Aviv (who might take over the affairs of the community in Jordan) a shameful act, and harms Arab inter-relations, especially as this is the first time such a decision is taken after the closure of the Mauritanian embassy in Iraq after accusing the former Iraqi president of destabilizing security in Mauritania, according to parliamentary sources.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Mauritanian government needs the Parliament's endorsement of the budget of any Mauritanian embassy overseas as part of the government's general budget which is to be presented to Parliament in an emergency session.</seg>
<seg id="8">But parliamentary sources thought it unlikely that the new parliament would agree to the budget for the Mauritanian embassy in Tel Aviv, since that was considered a waste of the people's property on something they fundamentally reject.</seg>

<seg id="2">It took no more than a decade after the defeat of Germany and Japan in the Second World War for them to lick the wounds of their defeat and get on the road to reconstructing themselves, their point of departure an understanding of the balance of power and the spirit of the post-war era, until they became two economic giants taken into consideration in the balance international powers. Whereas we are haunted by the defeat of June 5, 1967 till this day!</seg>
<seg id="3">The contemporary Arab history in general, and the Arab east in particular, is a series of events that have been formed and arranged as results of that defeat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat generated deep marks on the whole Arab life, as it wasn't merely a military defeat suffered by Arab armies but a total defeat for all structures of Arab society, since it was a test for the "socialism" built, and the "development" achieved and the "security state" that was established.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what, the defeat was a sign of change in the course of events towards further Arab descent, and a historical watershed whose dynamics started becoming very clear since the seventies of the last century and until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The defeat was not a passing moment in Arab life, as it put all the Arab nations on a downhill course, and they were not picked up from it with the victory of 1973 October War as it turned into a political defeat whose consequences followed in succession across all fields.</seg>
<seg id="7">Among these was that Arab communities, which achieved some modernization, reverted to the worst stages of their history, that is to a pattern of political life closer to that during the era of Mamluks or Ottomans, the most prominent feature of which was the separation of government from people, the separation of the society from the state, the stagnation of society and the ossification of its inner history, and the domination of a traditional ideology that strengthened subordination, compliance, incapacity, aversion and fear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Love is a beautiful human emotion, and it is the refinement that man made to his natural needs, exactly like it is with food, drink and the need for security, etc. It follows that feeling it and practicing it depends on the level of civility the person has reached. At this stage, it is controlled, like everything, by the power of the reason which defines the needs and clarifies the way of satisfying them.</seg>
<seg id="3">Therefore, I radically disagree with the great singer Souad Mohammed about love resulting from the heart or the eye, and the need to chose between them, as she questioned and expressed her bewilderment in the famous song!</seg>
<seg id="4">Love, like all else, springs from the need for it. Reason is just tantamount to an instrument for satisfying human needs, if we can use the expression, and it chooses between alternatives to decide which is the best and most appropriate for satisfaction. There are those who are aware of this, and those who are not.</seg>
<seg id="5">From lack of perception emerge all the metaphysical interpretations of love, from Cupid, through fate and destiny, to predetermination, so widespread in most of our Arabic romantic songs.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, there is no fate and no destiny. There are needs springing from human makeup, upbringing, conditions, or even genes. It doesn't matter which..</seg>

<seg id="2">Terrible pain and heavy concern burden me when I see the apathy of Egyptians towards what befell one of their esteemed members of parliament, and before him to one of Egypt's honorable judges at the hands of the valiant police.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is it right that this incident was not as important to most of Egypt's intellectuals, or even enlightened writers and activists as I believed it to be. It wasn't mentioned at all except by a few writers, and was not analyzed or clarified by any of those programs that we believed were a window of sorts for enlightening the people.</seg>
<seg id="4">So I say, if the members of parliament are the highest authority representing the people, even if we acknowledged the rigging, in the end it is the biggest speaker in the name of the people and its members, and they represent the dignity of the whole Egyptian people.</seg>
<seg id="5">And then for something like this to happen to one of these members of parliament, this act of hooliganism, of dragging along the ground, kicking and beating by a police officer,</seg>
<seg id="6">is such an embarrassing, no, a shameful thing that I cannot find a fitting and deserving description.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even worse is the boastful response of the perpetrator and the weak response of the victim.</seg>
<seg id="8">The victim, i.e. the Muslim Brotherhood -who regardless of their tendencies are representatives of the people-  got agitated and excited in their esteemed gathering, but didn't take it further.</seg>
<seg id="9">Can you believe this?</seg>
<seg id="10">Yes, believe it, my dear.</seg>
<seg id="11">I won't say that what happened deserved questioning the biggest head in the country and the one in charge of security in this country, because we have experienced them. But I say it truthfully, you should at least have handed in a group resignation, honorably, so as to preserve remnants of your parliament's and your nation's dignity. But you have disappointed us.</seg>
<seg id="12">For myself, as an Egyptian citizen who imitates what the symbols of the country's security are doing, I look with at you disdainfully, members of our parliament, and I see no problem if street kids beat you up and dragged you along the ground like others did before.</seg>

<seg id="2">I am beginning to doubt if the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has any political wisdom, or organizing mind conscious and aware of the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="3">The regime, whether knowingly or unknowingly, wanted to discriminate between Egyptians with a hateful, destructive sectarianism,</seg>
<seg id="4">in the so-called citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you seek what the intellectuals of Mubarak's regime consider as this citizenship, you'll be astonished.</seg>
<seg id="6">The citizenship - that of the regime's ideology - tells Egyptians that they are not all equal people of one country, rather that you are Christian, and others are Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Muslims have Article 2, and the others, the Christians, have Article 5.</seg>
<seg id="8">And they imposed a schism - knowingly or unknowingly - between Egyptians, even in their law and the constitution of their country.</seg>
<seg id="9">Someone might say, so what's the problem? Didn't that article - the one pertaining to Islamic Sharia - make Christians -the Others in the ideology of the regime- a bit worried, especially if the Brotherhood took over ruling Egypt?</seg>
<seg id="10">The regime as such did not bring on this sectarianism, as you allege.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the contrary, it dampened the concern that our Christian Egyptian brothers had.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, that might look nominally correct, but in my opinion, I think it is useless in practice, on the ground,</seg>
<seg id="13">and it creates foundations for more sectarianism and conflict between the people of the one country.</seg>
<seg id="14">Because you are openly telling compatriots that you are a minority in a jungle and this Article will protect you from the beasts of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe my interpretation is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the question is, will this, the way in which the regime is considering them, give the others - Egyptians through and through- peace of mind?</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't think so.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if the regime abolished the second Article from the constitution, the compatriots won't rest. On the contrary, they will demand more.</seg>
<seg id="19">And if more comes, it will not give them rest and they will not get peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="8">Soon these confrontations moved into a large number of Moroccan universities, like Marrakech, Casablanca and Er-rachidia.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this last one, the situation was more severe and repressive, because it witnessed the death of one of the students as a result of these barbarian incidents that no reason accepts or logic stomachs.</seg>
<seg id="10">One university, consecutive violence:</seg>
<seg id="11">In the seventies of last century, the leftist movement was controlling Moroccan university, making the student movement revolve around socialist and communist ideas which at that time were largely boosted by the presence of the Soviet Union as a superpower that was promoting revolutionary ideology and coups, and supporting it materially.</seg>
<seg id="12">This made the majority of students adopt those ideas and defend them. Moreover, the students, as well as the working class, were the locomotive that drove the socialist communist tide experienced in the world at that time.</seg>
<seg id="13">During that period, to disagree with the left, and not revolve in its orbit, resulted in barbaric violence at its worse.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some people here in Kuwait think that the role of the "local intellectual" should not exceed the feeling of alienation from local environment and a perpetual rage against general conditions, if thescongruous with the intellectual's personal aspirations.</seg>

<seg id="4">In this context, we do not think that the intellectual is required to make the feeling of alienation from local environment an established theme for his traditional and enlightening role.</seg>
<seg id="5">This means that we have to admit that some of us have gotten used, it seems, to appear in the role of the perpetually embittered against their "backward" societies, as they describe the environment in which they grew up, and that they, i.e. the embittered ones, do not expect but tragedies and darkness in the general progress of the society to which they belong.</seg>

<seg id="7">This other type of local intellectuals appear as if they were living in some la-la-land, or the eternally happy, smiling and optimistic Utopia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rationalism, or the traditional space in which the local Kuwaiti intellectual works needs to be "balanced", informing others about what is negative.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also a role inseparable from presenting practical solutions to the daily problems facing Kuwaiti society. At the same time, the local intellectual needs to inform about a coming future that will be happy, successful and filled with hope provided this or that course proposed by the intellectual is followed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Occasionally, loud outcries sound accusing the Shia of lack of patriotism and saying that their loyalty is to Iran and not to their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is of course a false accusation resulting from a number of reasons, but the most prominent among these reasons is that some of the vociferous callers do not know that the basis of the dispute about the loyalty goes back to the issue of imamate or the Shura, and from there branches out the issue of loyalty to the ruler, or loyalty to the land.</seg>
<seg id="4">Others who accuse the Shia of loyalty to Iran ignore the law of nature which states that man, whether he be Shia or Sunni, is brought up on the love of the country in which he was raised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whoever delves a bit into history will discover that accusing the Shia of disloyalty is not new, but hundreds of years old, and that its origin goes back to the fact that the Shia believe in the theory of imamate while the Sunnis believe in the theory of Shura.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not, of course, the time to explain the Shia or Sunni theory, but I am saying that after the disappearance of the Imam Mohammed bin al-Hassan (may Allah hasten his reappearance), the 12th Shia Imam, the Shia had to refer to jurists who fulfill a number of conditions, in accordance to the last letter from the Imam al-Mehdi (may Allah hasten his return) before his disappearance.</seg>
<seg id="7">The jurist to whom they had to refer could be from Saudi Arabia, or from Iran or from Afghanistan as the conditions mention the characteristics of the jurist, and not his nationality; Meanwhile the Sunnis continued to rule according to the theory of the Shura. They believe that the ruler is the person to whose authority should be upheld whether he is upright or corrupt. Following a period of time and after the failure of the nationalist movement and at the height of the Islamic revival, a Sunni movement appeared, it is the Brotherhood.</seg>

<seg id="2">Poetry is a form of literature, a vessel into which the poet pours in his whimsies day and night, it is the mirror of the soul, the essence of thought, the contradiction between mind and psyche.</seg>
<seg id="3">For what is known about literature is that it teaches and gives pleasure, two sides of an equation that is impossible to solve, and never ending.</seg>
<seg id="4">Poetry will prevail till the end of days, never stops at an era or a dilemma, for it is the dilemma at which the soul stops, and the secrets of nature, and the impulses of thinking, and the insomnia that exhausts, and a language that flourishes from time to time,</seg>
<seg id="5">revealing the poet's soul which fluctuates between ebb tide and flood tide.</seg>
<seg id="6">The poet is an uncommon being, a complex being in whose persona combines many personae.</seg>
<seg id="7">He alone is capable of programming a yes in every no and vice versa, he alone is capable of making a swelter into a green field, and a field a fire which burns the feet of those who walk it.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is that being who lives in all ages, we see him but he sees us only with his words which embrace our dreams and ease our wounds.</seg>
<seg id="9">The poet is a highly sensitive human towards everything, he feels even inanimate objects when we do not feel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He prophesies everything; he writes us and reads us at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="2">It has not been easy to bring together Tunisian journalists once again with the aim of discussing and exchanging viewpoints on a controversial issue which has led to much ink flowing, and about which there has been a great deal of talk on all channels and from all sources: the presence of a union to represent and defend journalists.</seg>
<seg id="3">The present union, set up a few years ago and which many activists in this field regard as a balm able to correct the situation, so embarrassing it inspires disgust, of those working in the press, has lived through a number of difficulties which prevented it from adopting the demands of its members and from entering into battle to defend them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The authorities were not beyond repressing the union's presence, placing a huge and enormous number of obstacles before it in order to weaken it and kill it in its cradle, but this was not easy.</seg>
<seg id="5">They were challenged by the majority of journalists who expressed their unlimited commitment to their union as a structure with the ability to manage their interests, and to discuss and communicate with the authorities and newspaper editors in order to achieve their ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those working on the matter of the journalists' union to correct some errors that coincided with the founding phase, had no choice but to join the Tunisian General Workers' Union (the only workers union in Tunisia) as a logical course to heal the rift and overcome the disagreements among companions along this path.</seg>
<seg id="7">The preliminary general meeting which the Regional Workers' Union in Tunis called for on Friday June 8, in the presence of union members and representatives of its leadership was a first important and necessary step.</seg>

<seg id="2">I am republishing this article on the occasion of the exam period.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fate would have it that I was an invigilator for university students in some examinations, at the Faculty of Arts in one of the universities.</seg>
<seg id="4">I am also someone who has recently been through university exams.</seg>
<seg id="5">I passed my last university exam the year before my first invigilation.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was aware that many students cheat</seg>
<seg id="7">and I knew those who were serious from those who were slack.</seg>
<seg id="8">But my view changed after I became an invigilator rather than under invigilation.</seg>
<seg id="9">And I became aware of the degree of deficiency or danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">I personally used to prepare for examinations with apprehension and fear and dread.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would not enter the examination room until I had memorized the subject I was going to be examined in or read about it and taken it in.</seg>
<seg id="12">I never once thought about cheating, I rather thought myself incapable of it.</seg>
<seg id="13">And if it happened that I should ask a student about a fact that I had forgotten or a question I had not understood or some such, I would find myself shaking and drawing other people's attention to me...</seg>
<seg id="14">I would see myself accused or under suspicion and distrust at the very least</seg>
<seg id="15">But after I became an invigilator invigilating students, which in my mind was a responsibility, and with a beginner's seriousness and strictness,</seg>
<seg id="16">I learned ways of cheating that had never crossed my mind, and not just ways of cheating but the mindset of the student being examined, so that cheating has become a culture the students exchange methods and techniques for, and can distinguish between lecturers who are easygoing and those who are strict.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fortunate amongst them are those under the invigilation of an easygoing lecturer and they even envy each other on this.</seg>

<seg id="2">An important administrative phenomenon which a top businessman brought up to me ironically, and which I phrase here in the form of a direct question: why don't intelligent people stay in their jobs?</seg>
<seg id="3">My answer is quite simply because their bosses are less intelligent.</seg>
<seg id="4">How?</seg>
<seg id="5">An intelligent person in business does not look for limited income and superficial tasks but rather looks deep into strategic visions to contribute into establishing himself if he is selfish, or into establishing himself and building his society if he is generous, and both know in detail the path they are following.</seg>
<seg id="6">Creative people define phases for their financial, social and knowledge development and this varies from one creative person to another as a function of how much creativity runs through his veins.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some set a period of two years as phase for development while others set a five-year period,</seg>
<seg id="8">while others set 20 to 30 years as a development period, and such a person's progress to the peak of success is slower than that of others.</seg>
<seg id="9">Intelligent people are characterized by a great adaptability and a ability to move forward and overcome risks.</seg>
<seg id="10">They constitute part of the 3%  who lead the world now.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is not easy because they lack financial stability and are more open to criticism and ridicule due to the number of setbacks they face in their lives.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they quickly take control of the situation, leaving the remaining 97% of people with their mouths agape with surprise.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patience is a feature of intelligent people but this does not mean they remain under control for periods we could call stable because they are generally rebels.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their patience depends on the time it takes for ideas to mature in their minds and the availability of opportunities to implement them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Intelligent people accept sacrificing what is worthwhile in order to achieve something that is even more worthwhile.</seg>

<seg id="7">While we all know the method followed in our country for people to become members of parliament (which along with the Council of Ministers is a way to reach the Shura Council, nominal in its work and performance in our country).</seg>
<seg id="8">Money, party membership and tribalism play a highly important role in the heated contest to reach parliament and this is how some illiterate and semi-educated people become MPs, as well as those with limited intellect and little knowledge who bring no benefit whatsoever to parliament.</seg>
<seg id="9">No, in fact many of them miss the sessions and being an MP becomes to them merely an elevated government post and a diplomatic passport with which they show off amongst people.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is a big difference in impressionability and influence in the two methods followed. The Saudi Shura council is a technocratic scientific council qualified to put forward powerful and important ideas to society and its rulers because it is made up of people in society with the most knowledge, experience and awareness where neither money nor tribalism nor party membership play a role in getting them into their position, but rather their scientific and educational level and their experience and standing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whereas in our parliament, we know of some MPs whom we never heard speaking for a whole year and who never even attend.</seg>
<seg id="12">And even if they attend and are present, we find that party groupings have a direct and large influence on the view of many members so that their views match the views of their blocs - be they right or wrong - whether this is in the ruling party or in the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, the Saudi Shura system is based on respecting the existing ruling regime and the ruler's person, and offering advice and suggestions through the approach of good retinue.</seg>
<seg id="14">Party membership is considered a crime and pluralism is rejected and no-one in the Shura Council attempts to challenge the ruler or damage his reputation.</seg>

<seg id="2">At a cultural salon attended by a number of businessmen and journalists, a debate took place about the image of businessmen in society.</seg>
<seg id="3">Does a businessmen necessarily have to be corrupt and achieve what he has achieved through cheating and suspect deals, or by a marriage between wealth and power?</seg>
<seg id="4">I asked about a specific definition of a businessman: is he a financier or an industrialist or a middle man?</seg>
<seg id="5">Engineer Mutez Raslan, President of the Egyptian-Canadian Businessmen's Institute, gave me a strange answer that had not occurred to anyone...a businessmen is all these things.</seg>
<seg id="6">And in fact the definition of a businessman extends much more than this, because anyone who offers a service or sells it is a businessman.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said, "the journalist and writer is a businessman because he sells his ideas to the reader and is paid for this, and so what applies to the journalist's image also applies to the businessman's."</seg>
<seg id="8">Most of the participants agreed that there is a certain link between wealth and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="9">But not every rich man is necessarily corrupt, and made his fortune through bribery, leverage and illegal methods.</seg>
<seg id="10">For my part, I tried to give the matter a political perspective.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is responsible for the corruption of businessmen and their poor image in society is a corrupt ruling regime because it allows some businessmen to go from being extremely poor to being millionaires by offering them facilities in land sale deals or the sale of a public sector company.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some participants gave examples of this, as the deals of selling Al-Ahram Alcoholic Beverages Company, the Qaha Food Company and others.</seg>

<seg id="3">Far be it.</seg>
<seg id="4">My heartfelt wish is for everyone to find the biggest number possible of symbols in every area.</seg>
<seg id="5">I followed their example but only found two symbols: the crescent moon and the camel.  This is why I decided not to look for symbols for Egypt as much as I try to unravel the symbols that exist, no doubt this would help me understand the reasons for my harmful intentions and purposes.</seg>
<seg id="6">I want to strike a blow at the heart of Al-Masri Al-Youm celebrating its third year and in which chose to explore symbols of Egypt in this era of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="7">To ask it and its readers why Egypt needs symbols when it has the biggest symbol of all which lights up her nights and blesses her days, leads her progress towards majesty, plows with her ferry through the waves of the sea, plants the desert for her with his wisdom, picking the fruit for h with his own hands and wiping away bitterness away from her face.</seg>

<seg id="9">How we walked with Fathi Radwan and fell with Fateh Surour.</seg>

<seg id="14">Do we depend on those we trust or those who have experience?</seg>
<seg id="15">After the June defeat, we spent even longer years disagreeing on whether we were defeated because of our dependence on people we trusted or the dependence on people with experience.</seg>
<seg id="16">Finally we settled the dispute and ignored both trust and experience, and limited ourselves to depending on family.</seg>

<seg id="2">From time to time, we come across the term Yazidi nationalism on the Bahzani.net website.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I say to those who disseminate this term that all Yazidis become uneasy with brothers who raise the issue of religion and nationalism, although people are not responsible for your misinterpretation of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it not reasonable for you to say something when you have no convincing evidence of what you claim.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yazidism is a religion and not a nationality, and we don't need a new creation seeking to merge religion and nationalism under the same term as this doesn't exist anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">As far as I know, God did not create a nation with this name, so once again it is a made-up creation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let the promoters of this creation help us understand how they reached this ?</seg>
<seg id="8">And what are their actual facts?</seg>
<seg id="9">How is it formed and born now?</seg>
<seg id="10">We will see whether you will be able to prove and defend it, and all that you believe in, or will you remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the past, there was a similar idea to this from Armenia's Yazidis who emigrated from Qurs, Wan and Ararat and this was a reaction to being driven out by the racist policies of the Ottoman Empire.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was able to incite some Muslim Kurds to implement its plans so it exploited their religious feelings and fooled them and they are still paying the price for this deceit.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the time, the idea among the group was that they were Yazidis and that was all. However, their intellectuals and leaders noticed a mistake in that position and were able to explain to people and those in charge of disseminating the idea and promoting it.</seg>
<seg id="14">What is known about the Yazidis is that they are part of the Kurdish nation and they say they are Kurds but not Muslims, and this is proven by historians who are factual and neutral.</seg>

<seg id="2">The case of the Moroccan citizen who made a public toilet a home for his family in the town of Sala led to a great deal of condemnation from citizens.</seg>
<seg id="3">Especially as the authorities gave him an address on his national identity card officially recognizing his place of residence. The card was issued by the Ministry of the Interior which found no embarrassment in handing over a national identity card carrying the address of a toilet.</seg>
<seg id="4">With this it ignores any principles of human rights and human dignity, and disregards all the slogans put forward by the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">But what annoyed me was when Al-Jazeera met the head of Sala local council to ask about the situation, the Moroccan official stumbled blindly against the barrage of questions put to him by the news presenter.</seg>
<seg id="6">He did not clarify anything and simply said that the council had documents showing that the person in question was the security guard at the toilet and nothing else, and if he lived in them exclusively and barred people from using the toilet,</seg>
<seg id="7">then the mistake was made by the authorities which gave him a residential certificate with the toilet as the address.</seg>
<seg id="8">Our friend meant here was local government representatives, in other words the major and the commander in the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Moroccan official kept repeating the same two words "accounts and conspiracy" but he had no idea himself what conspiracy or accounts he was talking about.</seg>
<seg id="10">In brief, this official did not give any explanation, even more than that, repeated the errors and blunders of his ilk, who are supposedly there to serve the citizen. Definitely, this is a glaring humanitarian and social scandal.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is established by proof  and evidence, and even more so, by the admission of the General Directorate of the National Security Services which hands out national identity cards, and of course above it the Ministry of the Interior, and this scandalous evidence is directed to those who claim that Morocco is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="12">To those who refute everything that is said about oppression, subjugation, exclusion, marginalization and even trampling human dignity, to those who claim human rights.</seg>

<seg id="9">Last century, Hamas was the epitome of bravery.</seg>
<seg id="10">It bore its responsibilities towards the plundered country as did its sister Fatah although they differed in their ideas.</seg>
<seg id="11">But this does not make Fatah the enemy for the enemy is blatantly clear and does not need a magnifying glass to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="12">But after the end of the first chapter that ended with Doctor Abdul Aziz Al-Rentisi, God Rest His Soul, Hamas lost its wisdom and  insight and patience and won the elections...</seg>

<seg id="14">And also won the elections!</seg>
<seg id="15">The months passed but Hamas in government is crawling and stumbling while the clever Fatah fox looks on and issues its orders to obliterate Hamas, the reckless politically.</seg>
<seg id="16">How often did I wish to see Hamas strike the hands of the wrongdoers with an iron fist.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it did not act and it waits until the evicted Fatah comes to sit again upon the seat of power but with a Hamas mask.</seg>
<seg id="18">The people paid with their blood for this cowardice on Hamas' part.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Fatah exploited the situation to the full.</seg>
<seg id="20">It recruited, cheated and pillaged so that Hamas would look weak and incapable of anything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The secret strikes continued in succession while you, Oh Prime Minister Ismail Haniyah, showed restraint but at the wrong time because administration is boldness and ruling is politics and justice is experience, wisdom and an iron hammer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Because while you should have suppressed the troublemakers, Sir, you held seminars and learnt at the hands of the dishonest.</seg>
<seg id="23">And you resorted to those with the black turbans for assistance.</seg>

<seg id="6">My friend, do not say Dahlan has a tower in Dubai, for there are no evidence, in my possession at least, to prove this and there is no side that will take responsibility for this.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let us turn a blind eye to the meetings which were described as amicable between Dahlan and the generals and Zionist members of the Knesset and which I say will not be used in the interests of Palestine and this is a minimum requirement, and this is where the finger of accusation can be pointed at Dahlan because if there was no Palestine then Dahlan would not have the right to sit or get to know those killers, and he should have at least used his friendship with them to benefit his people.</seg>

<seg id="10">Mr. Abbas, I have never been against you but of course this sentence is in the past tense, because we as Palestinians do not need a weak, shaky personality, not able even to bear his responsibilities and not even brave enough to admit defeat, but you, Sir, quite nonchalantly accept 600 million dollars from the Zionists and you now carry an odor that is unbearable to any Muslim/Arab/Palestinian.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian businessman Andrey Lugovoy, accused by Britain of the murder of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, has made the very same accusation against London.</seg>
<seg id="2">Lugovoy denied any part in the agent's death and said that the British intelligence services and Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky were the most likely suspects.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a live press conference on Russian TV yesterday, Lugovoy, who was also an agent in the Soviet intelligence services, said "Britain is making me a scapegoat in the Litvinenko case."</seg>
<seg id="4">Lugovoy started the interview by announcing that the British intelligence services had succeeded in recruiting both the late Litvinenko and the billionaire Berezovsky, who is exiled in London.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that Litvinenko had admitted to him that he was recruited and that he instructed Berezovsky to co-operate with the British intelligence services and hand over his documents about the Russian National Security Council of which he was secretary-general in the days of former President Boris Yeltsin.  This made it easy for him to obtain political asylum in Britain then British citizenship later.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lugovoy acknowledged that he was not sure who killed his former colleague with radioactive polonium in London last November but said there were three probable suspects: the British intelligence services, the mafia and billionaire Berezovsky.</seg>
<seg id="7">British authorities declined a direct response to Lugovoy's statement and a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office simply said that "this is a criminal case and not an intelligence issue. A British citizen was killed in London and the lives of British citizens and visitors were endangered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Britain's move to grant Berezovsky the right of asylum has angered Moscow, which wants him handed over to face criminal charges in Russia. Berezovsky emerged as Putin's main opponent after he had admitted that he wanted to fund a revolution for regime change in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Matthew Bryza, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, said in a press conference in Baku that Iraq may be connected to the Baku-Arzrum pipeline between Azerbaijan and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added that "the United States is stepping up preparation of conditions in Iraq for investors wanting to pump money in to resume gas production there."</seg>
<seg id="4">He went on to say that Turkey, Iraq and the United States intend to continue talks on developing the Iraqi energy sector after holding an earlier round of talks last March.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said "no estimates were made yet for the investment required to set up the gas infrastructure in Iraq,</seg>
<seg id="6">but it will be necessary to invest in improving the existing infrastructure, in spite of problems relating to ensuring their security."</seg>
<seg id="7">Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, told a conference the day before yesterday Tuesday that his country would increase its gas production to 16 billion m3 in 2008, up from 12 billion m3 this year, and will start exporting widely to Europe through the Baku-Arzrum pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most of the oil carried through the pipeline will come from Azerbaijan's giant Shakh-Deniz field on the Caspian Sea, managed by BP of Britain, Statoil of Norway, Lukoil of Russia, Total of France and the Iranian and Turkish national oil companies.</seg>

<seg id="1">I am surprised at the Arab media's silence about Hurricane Gono's unwelcome visit to the Gulf coasts.</seg>
<seg id="2">I hope that thinking and reflection are the motives behind this silence and not confusion or concealment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whatever the reason, I maintain that the surprise visit of this hurricane must be taken seriously because it is sending us a message we need to receive and read well so that we can understand its content and lessons before it is too late.</seg>
<seg id="4">First of all, we must thank God that the hurricane was not as powerful and brutal as the famous Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina which hit Asian and American coasts two years ago, causing widespread destruction and damage, from which the regions have not recovered until this moment..</seg>
<seg id="5">It is true that the Sultanate of Oman was hit to some extent as was Iran but the damage was nothing compared to the effects of the two above-mentioned hurricanes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Official Omani reports and statements mentioned the death of 49 people while 27 others were recorded as missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The hurricane also destroyed highways and bridges linking the eastern provinces to the capital Muscat and caused floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, it affected crude oil exports from Mina Al Fahal Port, halted gas exports from Sur Port, and flooded a few villages.</seg>
<seg id="9">By the time the hurricane reached southern Iran, its force had relatively waned; its victims there were no more than 12 dead and 9 reported missing. Floods led to the displacement of 40 thousand residents in four different provinces, where roads, bridges and houses were damaged.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coasts of other Gulf states were far from the path of the hurricane, which spared them its effects; another blessing that we must thank God for.</seg>

<seg id="14">And although terrorists claim that they are furthering Palestinian interests they only succeeded in undermining them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Israel has a vested interest, which it shares with moderates across the region, in creating a stable, flourishing and peaceful partner committed to working towards the development of a Palestinian state and not to opposing the Jewish state, as we demonstrated when we implemented the Gaza disengagement plan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel is prepared to take painful steps in order to further this objective, but we need to know that our partners are also ready for a historic reconciliation and that our sacrifices will bring us permanent peace and security, because we also deserve a political prospect.</seg>

<seg id="4">He added that at the present time it is not projected that Kouchner will visit Darfur in west Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="5">The French Minister has made Darfur his priority since his appointment less than three weeks ago. However, on Wednesday he appeared to be backtracking on the idea of establishing a "humanitarian corridor" from Chad to help the civilian population.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kouchner, who is a proponent of the "intervention on humanitarian grounds" principle, acknowledged on Thursday that he is not "fully confident" about the possibility of establishing a humanitarian corridor from Chad, pointing out that the corridor under discussion would in any case be no more than an "air bridge".</seg>
<seg id="7">Kouchner begins an African tour on Thursday, and his first stop will be in Mali where he will attend on Friday the inauguration of Mali's President Amadou Toumani Touré and will take the opportunity of his presence in Bamako to meet a number of African heads of state.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kouchner is to visit Chad on Saturday and Sunday, heading to the east of the country on Saturday to investigate the conditions of displaced people and refugees, according to the source.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday he will meet Chad's President Idriss Déby before moving on to Khartoum in the evening, the source added.</seg>
<seg id="10">Eastern Chad shelters around 400,000 people; they are Sudanese refugees from Darfur and displaced people from Chad.</seg>
<seg id="11">Darfur has seen continuous conflict since 2003 between rebel groups and Sudanese forces supported by Arab militias. The conflict resulted so far in killing 200,000 people and displacing two million others; it also threatens to destabilize the entire region.</seg>

<seg id="2">South Korea's army said that North Korea launched two short-range missiles over the China Sea on Thursday after two weeks of similar test launches.</seg>
<seg id="3">A military spokesman told Agence France-Presse that the first missile was launched on Thursday morning and the second in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two missiles appear to be land-to-sea or sea-to-sea missiles with a range of 100 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="5">He added that the two missiles landed within North Korea's territorial waters, considering this a routine test similar to those conducted by North Korea every year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Elsewhere, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe announced on the sidelines of the G8 summit in Heiligendamm (north-east Germany) that "the United States and our allies believe that North Korea should abstain from missile tests."</seg>
<seg id="7">He added that "North Korea must concentrate on nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula and abide by the commitments it made in the February 13 agreement on starting nuclear disarmament in North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="8">He concluded by saying that "this sort of behavior is not constructive".</seg>
<seg id="9">North Korea fired short-range missiles on May 25 off its shores as part of routine tests which apparently did not expose its northern neighbor to any immediate danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">This took place at a time of tension between North Korea and Japan, which imposed economic sanctions on Pyongyang following a nuclear test carried out on October 9, 2006. It was also the time when the six-nation negotiations on the nuclear crisis faltered because of a financial dispute between Pyongyang and Washington.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kuwait 6-10-2007 (AFP) - Three Kuwaiti opposition MPs made a formal request on Sunday to the National Assembly to question Oil Minister Sheikh Ali Al-Jarrah Al-Sabah following certain controversial press statements. They accuse him of financial and administrative abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2">The request was made by MPs Musallam Al_Barrak, Adel Al-Saraawi and Abdullah Al-Roumi who represent different opposition blocs and are demanding the dismissal of the minister, who is a member of the Kuwaiti ruling family.</seg>
<seg id="3">Discussions on the questioning is expected to take place on June 25 according to Kuwaiti parliament regulations and could turn into a motion for a vote of no-confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">If parliament makes a no-confidence vote against the oil minister, he will automatically be considered as resigned. One of the MPs who put forward the request for "questioning" said "we do not want the minister to remain in his post because we believe that Sheikh Ali's persistence in his post poses a threat to the dynamic oil sector."</seg>
<seg id="5">Sheikh Ali praised former Oil Minister Sheikh Ali Al-Khalifa Al-Sabah in press statements although this minister is accused by the government of corruption, an accusation he denies completely.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sheikh Ali Al-Jarrah said that he considers his predecessor to be his teacher and asks for his advice on oil issues from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="7">The current Oil Minister issued a declaration in which he apologized for his statements and stressed that he will be strict in going after those involved in appropriating public funds.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2001, Sheikh Ali Al-Khalifa, along with four officials from the official Kuwaiti oil carrier company (Kuwait Oil Tanker Co.), were accused of illegal profiteering during the Eighties at the company's expense which registered losses of 100 million dollars for this period.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government also accused Sheikh Ali of failure to protect public funds when he was Minister of Finance in the Eighties. Sheikh Ali Al-Khalifa denies the charges against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">London 6-12-2007 (AFP) - the British House of Commons rejected on Monday a memorandum presented by the Conservative Party calling for a new investigation into Labor government's policies in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2">The proposal was rejected by a majority of 288 votes versus 253, in other words by a very narrow margin for the British government under Tony Blair.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gordon Brown who is expected to take over from Blair as Prime Minister on June 27 had considered proposing the memorandum inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with British television network Sky News during his visit to Iraq on Monday, Brown said "this is not an appropriate time even to think about an investigation, when the objective is uniting all efforts in support of our forces on the ground".</seg>
<seg id="5">The Conservative Party's foreign affairs spokesman, William Hague, rejected this justification.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "it is not true that our troops will be demoralized or that our enemies will receive a boost if we try to identify where we went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="7">He added, "In a democratic society, studying failure and success is a sign of strength not weakness."</seg>
<seg id="8">The memorandum required questioning political decision-makers and military leaders before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hague told BBC Four that "it is very important to launch an investigation by the end of 2007 about what happened in 2003, before events are erased from memory and before a lot of correspondence disappears."</seg>

<seg id="3">Ban told journalists, "I am certainly concerned about the new allegations concerning North Korea's misappropriation of UN Development Program funds.", while UN Development Program said that US accusations were "inconsistent" with the results of its own thorough investigations carried out six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ban declared that he asked the chairman of the UN Consultative Committee for Administrative and Budget Questions to continue examining this case and said that he would also look into the possibility of sending auditors to North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="2">A state of alert has been declared in the Lebanese army and the international emergency forces (UNIFIL) on Monday in Southern Lebanon after two rockets were fired from Lebanese territories on northern Israel, for the first time in ten months.</seg>
<seg id="3">An Agence France-Presse correspondent reported that Lebanese army and UNIFIL armored vehicles carried out patrols on roads along the Israeli border while the army and police set up checkpoints along the border.</seg>
<seg id="4">Two rockets fell on Sunday afternoon on the town of Kiryat Shmona in Israel, 10 kilometers from the Lebanese border causing minor damages and no casualties.</seg>
<seg id="5">Firing the rockets, in a first such operation since the war between Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and the Israeli army in August 2006, has led to increased tension in Lebanon at a time when it is going through a wave of attacks and violent clashes between the army and Fatah al-Islam fighters in the Nahr Al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp in the north.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israel accused earlier an unnamed Palestinian organization of firing the rockets while Hezbollah denied any link to the operation and the Lebanese government pledged to pursue those responsible.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora said that "the state through its security systems will spare no effort in finding out who is behind this incident which is aimed at destabilizing Lebanon."</seg>
<seg id="8">UNIFIL considered that firing the two rockets constitutes a "serious breach of the ceasefire" in place since last summer in accordance with UN resolution 1701 and called on all parties to remain calm.</seg>

<seg id="3">Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker spoke about the great challenge of this summit in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper and said, "I really don't like the idea of a Europe moving at two different speeds but if we are unable to move forward together, then this idea will be the only solution for getting out of the dilemma."</seg>
<seg id="4">With this he was expressing the huge displeasure felt by many "Old Europeans" towards the continuing paralysis of European institutions over the past two years.</seg>
<seg id="5">He considered that chances of reaching an agreement were equal to those of failing to reach one,</seg>
<seg id="6">and warned that "any expansion of the Union is not possible without the ratification of a new Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="7">As for the new French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who supported the German Chancellor and current President of the European Union Angela Merkel in her efforts to arrive at a mini-Constitution salvaging the essence of the constitution rejected by the French and Dutch, he expressed his caution about the results of this summit which may continue until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">He told the French private channel TF1 "we will try to reach a settlement and I cannot imagine us not achieving this."</seg>

<seg id="3">The former European Commissioner was appointed head of the World Trade Organization in 2005 because of his presumed ability to bring negotiations to conclusion.</seg>

<seg id="3">After a morning meeting between the Polish President and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Polish diplomats announced that no progress had been made on the issue of qualified majority voting which threatens to bring down the entire EU Treaty,</seg>

<seg id="6">The divergence between Poland and Germany is not so great anymore; there are problems with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="7">Poland considers that the qualified majority voting system stipulated in the constitutional treaty gives Germany a lot of weight.</seg>
<seg id="8">The treaty stipulates decisions to be taken with a majority of 55% of member state votes, and that these states must represent 65% of the population of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Instead of this system, Poland suggested ratifying the 'square root' formula to calculate the number of inhabitants in each country of the Union, considering this as a fairer system. Jaroslaw Kaczynski said "all we want is fairness".</seg>

<seg id="5">This new text which mentions chapter seven of the United Nations treaty (applied in situations where international peace and security are threatened) requires the sides to "abstain from giving unilateral statements about Kosovo's final status during this period".

<seg id="2">In his comment on the results of the International Somalia Contact Group sessions, which closed the day before yesterday in the British capital London with the development of an international concept for the political process in Somalia during the next phase and the factors needed to achieve national reconciliation and restore stability and security in the country, Aboul Gheit said that the Egyptian delegation which participated in the final two meetings of the Contact Group found it necessary to re-affirm this and warn of the danger of misunderstanding the complexities of the Somali crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added that observing the efforts of Egypt over the past 16 years and the efforts of the Arab League recently to achieve national reconciliation in Somalia clearly reveals that the Arab side can actively contribute -through a neutral role and complete understanding of the complexities of the crisis- in helping Somalia out of its crisis.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is demonstrated in the Somali people's appreciation, across all ethnicities and affiliations, for the Arab role in solving the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Foreign Minister expressed his amazement that some continued to ignore these facts, believing that the magic wand to resolve the Somali crisis is only available to some Western countries and research centers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Aboul Gheit warned against attempts to ignore the Arab and Islamic dimensions of Somalia and said this would only lead to complicating the crisis further.</seg>

<seg id="3">Eng Rasheed Mohamed Rasheed said that the agreements signed are part of the Ministry of Industry and Trade's plan to develop and upgrade internal and external trade with the aim of driving economic growth, supporting planning and decision-making at all levels, contributing to the development of the country's commercial sector, and increasing the competitive capacities of Egyptian companies by providing information about various economic activities in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mohamed El-Masri, President of the Union of Chambers of Commerce in Egypt, said that this agreement is aimed at automating the activities of the 18 Chambers of Commerce in the second phase of the project, and providing basic services for around four million traders in all the Chambers of Commerce by completing the website of the Union of Chambers of Commerce to include Chambers of Commerce and training the Union's administrative organs to use information technology and advanced applications as well as building a verified and modernized traders' database.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ali Moussa, President of the Cairo Chamber of Commerce, said that the protocol is aimed at training a number of trainers qualified to instruct traders in training courses held as part of the training program on the fundamentals of electronic business administration, as well as training 3,000 traders chosen by the Chamber of Commerce after they are assessed and pass the testing criteria approved by the Ministry of Trade and Ministry of Communications. The investment cost of this project is estimated at round two million Egyptian pounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">The course of current events in the Palestinian Territories confirms that Israel is the sole beneficiary of the current situation resulting from Hamas' control over security services headquarters in Gaza Strip and the decrees that followed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazin), leading to the emergence of two clashing entities neither of which can impose its authority on the other, given the lack of geographical contiguity between them. In addition, Israel itself will not allow either of the two forces to move to eradicate the other, which is something that Israel is expected to perpetuate as it serves its strategic interests and fulfills its old dream.</seg>
<seg id="2">If we go back a little, in particular to December 18, 2005, we will plainly see the accuracy of this vision because in the Israeli Cabinet session of that day, Aharon Zeevi-Farkash, Director of Israeli Military Intelligence, announced at the time -during his presentation of what was called intelligence surveillance-</seg>
<seg id="3">that it was possible for Gaza Strip to turn into Hamastan and the West Bank into Fatahstan.</seg>
<seg id="4">He went on to say "we can use whatever terms we want about Abu Mazin and his intentions of doing something but the end result is that nothing will come out of this."</seg>
<seg id="5">Farkash clarified what he meant by saying that "there are possibilities that the West Bank and Gaza Strip will turn into two individual geographical units in 2006."</seg>
<seg id="6">What is certain is that Israel has helped -one way or another- in turning the aforementioned vision into reality by stirring up the conflict between Fatah and Hamas, directly or indirectly, because this serves its interests regardless of which side currently controls the situation in Gaza.</seg>

<seg id="2">In this context, the issue of intellectual and organizational revisions - which the Egyptian Jihad Group is on the verge of announcing these days and the preceding broader and deeper revisions started by al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group) ten years ago - raises</seg>
<seg id="3">real questions about its future and influence on the phenomenon of religious violence in Egypt and the world, for which the term 'jihadist' is used, to describe it and its perpetrators</seg>
<seg id="4">The main question around which predictions and concerns revolve with regard to the future is: will these revisions lead to ending or reducing religious violence, which Egypt has suffered from over long years past and which the world continues to suffer from until today? Or will its effect be limited and this suffering continue?</seg>
<seg id="5">The truth is that answering this question, prediction, lies within the question itself, because distinguishing between the future of this violence phenomenon in Egypt and outside Egypt is considered the first starting point for answering and predicting.</seg>
<seg id="6">the revisions started by al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya in Egypt through its announcement of an initiative to end violence ten years ago on July 5, 1997 did actually result in a complete end to all aspects and practices of religious violence in this country, by this group, for the duration of this period, and without a single exception, starting with the western bank massacre in Luxor carried out on November 17, 1997 by members of the group, who were unaware of the initiative taken by its leaders and their decision to end the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The importance of these ten years of complete cessation of violence, is that it represents over a third of the group's lifetime, which is around three decades, and not just a short period of it, which some might regard as an exception in a long history or a short-term truce that will soon end.</seg>

<seg id="2">This announcement coincided with the statement by his ambassador to the United Nations, on the same day, about disagreements in the Security Council preventing implementation of previous decisions on boycotting Iran.</seg>
<seg id="3">The truth is that American sanctions against Iran go back to the early Eighties when American companies were prohibited from signing oil contracts there. This was followed by Congress's legislation of 1996, the "Iran-Libya Sanctions Act", which imposed sanctions on foreign (non-American) companies investing more than 20 million dollars a year in Iran's oil industry.</seg>
<seg id="4">The sanctions against Libya were lifted after the dispute concerning bombing an American aircraft over Lockerbie in Scotland was settled.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is clear that the United States has been unsuccessful so far in destabilizing the Iranian oil industry, as happened in Iraq in the nineties of last century.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, what was achieved was the use of continuous pressure to limit the natural growth of this industry and return it to its levels before the 1979 revolution.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is known that Iran's oil production capacity in the final years of the Shah's rule reached around six million barrels a day then fell during the Iraq-Iran war to around 2.6 million barrels a day, and has now risen to four million barrels a day.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the same time, the government announced it had decided to appoint a senior official at the Turkish Foreign Ministry, diplomat Rifaat Aq Jonai, to that Committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">It should be pointed out that this Committee is concerned with the activities of the Kurdistan Workers' Party and was set up upon an American suggestion over a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the time, Washington said the objective of setting up this Committee was to help Ankara track down terrorist groups which want to harm it. However, those close to political circles in Ankara said the real objective is to persuade Ankara not to invade Iraqi Kurdistan in pursuit of Workers' Party fighters who use the steep, mountainous regions on the Iraq-Iran border as a haven for their activities and to look instead into non-military solutions in cooperation with the Iraqis and Kurdish leaders in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth mentioning that Ankara issued a wave of threats at that time about invading Iraqi Kurdistan to track down Workers' Party fighters. However, the Kurdish leadership in Iraq responded by saying it would not stand defenseless in the face of any Turkish military invasion but would regard it as an occupation act and call on Kurds to fight it.</seg>
<seg id="6">And since Iraqi Kurdistan is the sole secure area in a turbulent Iraq, the United States was quick to persuade Ankara to abandon its military threats and resort to peaceful solutions based on cooperation with Iraqi Kurds in order to drive fighters out of their strongholds and put an end to their armed operations.</seg>

<seg id="2">He said the aim of the operation was most probably to bargain for the release of five Iranian diplomats arrested in Erbil.</seg>
<seg id="3">While an advisor to the Iraqi Prime Minister said that American forces would review the arrest of the Iranian diplomats, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki threatened the United States, saying it would "regret" arresting the five Iranians.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Iraqi security source who did not want to be named told Al-Hayat that British forces were following leads that could result in locating the five British citizens.</seg>
<seg id="5">He indicated that available information about this case pointed to the responsibility of a Mahdi Army splinter group, with links to intelligence services of a country in the region which he refused to name.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said the aim of the kidnapping was most probably bargaining for the release of five Iranian diplomats arrested by American forces in Erbil in January.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reuters news agency reported Mottaki as saying that Iran would make the United States "regret" the Iranians' arrest.</seg>
<seg id="8">He added, "we will make the Americans regret their ugly and illegal act against the Consulate of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Erbil and kidnapping the five diplomats."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Iranian News Agency reported that Mottaki made it clear that the Foreign Ministry "placed a series of broad measures on its agenda against these illegal and inadmissible actions which contravene all international conventions." He did not give further details.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mottaki said that Iran would send a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon within days to complain about "clear discrimination" by the Security Council as it delays putting the issue of the arrested Iranians on its agenda.</seg>

<seg id="1">Calm reigned over Gaza Strip after six days of fierce battles between Fatah and Hamas supporters which resulted in 116 people dead and 550 others wounded. The battles ended with Hamas' announcement of total control over Gaza, compelling the international community, represented by the International Quartet, to announce its full support for President Mahmoud Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="2">In spite of this, Washington denied any intention of cutting emergency aid to Gaza Strip or "making a distinction between dealings with Gaza and the West Bank", and announced that it was examining a series of options on how to deal with the latest developments, such as strengthening Abbas by making progress in the peace process and improving conditions in the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="3">For its part, the Israeli government preferred to "wait, watch and prepare", although the events in Gaza expedited the endorsement of Ehud Barak's appointment as a Minister of Defense. On the other hand, Chairman of Hamas' Political Bureau, Khaled Mashal, held the international community essentially responsible for the crisis between Fatah and Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="4">In parallel, the Palestinian President asked Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to form an "emergency government" after dissolving the Unity Government, an appointment regarded by Hamas as unconstitutional and "in breach of all laws".</seg>
<seg id="5">Its spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told Agence France Presse, "this is a coup against legitimacy and a breach of Palestinian laws and all national accords."</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile Hamas' spokesman at the Palestinian Legislative Council, the movement's Secretary Mushir Al-Masri who is in Cairo, told Al-Hayat that Abbas' decision was "illegal and unconstitutional; it heightens the crisis and complicates matters", and warned of the conflict moving into the West Bank, saying that "if this happens, Hamas leaders will have no option but to bear arms to defend themselves."</seg>

<seg id="1">An oil expert said it was unlikely that the White House would approve a plan to prosecute OPEC countries in American courts for price fixing, voted for by Congress (Senate and House of Representatives).</seg>
<seg id="2">Emirates expert Ayman Saif said in an interview with Al-Hayat, "the accusation of price fixing made by Democrat Herb Cole and Republican Arlen Specter and approved by the American Senate is not directed only at the Organization's countries but against all oil producers in the world."</seg>
<seg id="3">He added "but because other non-OPEC countries do not have a common link, the accusation against OPEC comes because it includes a large number of producers."</seg>
<seg id="4">Saif does not believe American President George W. Bush will approve this law because it damages America's interests and opens the door to other countries treating its products in the same way. It also does not respect the sovereignty and independence of countries and sets a dangerous precedent.</seg>
<seg id="5">Saif stated that "calling for such a law is not new; it happened for the first time in 1978 when a labor group put forward a case against OPEC under the Antitrust Act but the American Court of Appeal rejected the case in 1981 on the basis that members of the organization enjoy immunity against legal cases because their decisions are those of sovereign countries. The second attempt was in 2005 but the case was dropped before it was voted on."</seg>
<seg id="6">Saif considered that "the ones who should be tried are the big oil companies (and most are American) for their monopoly on drilling and refining technology."</seg>
<seg id="7">Speculators in the world oil markets are the ones who raise prices and not the producing countries, and the increase in prices is not the result of a shortage in supply but because American refineries fail to produce enough to meet market needs there.</seg>

<seg id="2">The joint attack took place in broad daylight, and was given the name "Hot Summer". It was carried out by Al-Quds Brigades -the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad movement- and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade of the Fatah movement.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade unit, called Abu Ali, said that activists in a jeep with United Nations insignia broke through the crossing gate.</seg>

<seg id="3">He added that the others were four officials in the company including Sorour's sister, who is holds the position of managing director, and two officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.</seg>

<seg id="1">The daily British newspaper The Guardian and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) surprised the whole world by publishing details of bribes and commissions received by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, former Saudi Ambassador to Washington and Secretary-General of the Saudi National Security Council. They were part of Al Yamamah weapons deal bought by the Saudi government from Britain, at a cost of 43 billion pounds sterling, equivalent to eighty billion dollars, and included the purchase of Tornado and Hawk aircrafts.</seg>
<seg id="2">There are many details on how these commissions and bribes were paid, and they are now known, but they may become clearer in voice and picture when the BBC broadcasts its television program on the results of investigations and meetings to find out the truth.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is not known however, at least to the Arab reader, is the party behind this discovery, leaked information to the media, and the reasons behind this.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before answering this question, we have to go back a little, specifically to British Prime Minister Tony Blair's personal intervention when he stopped the investigations of an independent judicial committee into the deal and commissions related to it. This, after the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia threatened to sever its relations with Britain, suspend its cooperation in the war against terror, and pull out of a new weapons deal it intended to buy from Britain worth a total of 70 billion dollars, and includes new Eurofighter aircrafts .</seg>
<seg id="5">Tony Blair, who steps down in about two weeks, said he takes personal responsibility for this decision because continuing the investigation would disclose results that threaten Britain's national security and damage relations with an ally who actively participated in the war against terror and Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="3">He also agreed to involve British forces in the war on Iraq even though President George Bush personally announced that Britain could help in other ways.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper explained that this disclosure, which appears in a two-part documentary to be broadcast on Channel 4 next Saturday, would raise many questions about the assurances Blair gave the British public, when the war  broke out in March 2003, that he was satisfied with the post-war plans for Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Iranian government has made every amicable effort with the current Iraqi government to consider this a terrorist organization and deal with it accordingly, and to cooperate with the Iraqi parliament to issue legislation for expelling it from Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="3">The United States Trade Representative Susan C. Schwab said, "the time has come to take the next step in developing stricter regulations for the World Trade Organization which will limit the use of government industrial aid."</seg>
<seg id="4">She added, "the government aid we want to ban sustains inefficient production capacity in industries which range from steel to semi-conductors."</seg>
<seg id="5">Stricter regulations for this type of aid will face practices that discredit trade for many of our trade partners and which generally lead to unfair trading.</seg>
<seg id="6">These negotiations are held within the framework of the Doha development agenda in accordance with the statement issued by the American Trade Representation Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American proposal will ban the following five types of aid if they are "specific", and those given only to a particular company or industry and benefit a producer who exports or competes with imports:</seg>
<seg id="8">Covering operating losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Waiver of government debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Loans to companies not working at full capacity.</seg>
<seg id="11">Indirect investment in non-fair companies.</seg>

<seg id="2">The committee meetings will be held with the participation of, in particular, the organization's secretary-general, representatives of 31 countries at the level of tourism minsters, and travel writers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The agenda of this round includes a number of related topics, especially concerning sustainable tourism development, solidarity, cooperation, and security, in addition to a host of administrative, organizational and financial issues.</seg>
<seg id="4">Al-Tijani Hadad, the Tunisian Minister of Tourism and President of the organization's Executive Committee, said in a speech he made at the opening session that choosing Tunisia to host this round reflects the importance of the tourism sector in Tunisia, which had an echo recently at the Davos Conference where Tunisia was ranked at the top in terms of the attention the general authorities give the tourism sector.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the new world order which remains confusing calls for tourism destinations to reinforce their ability to adapt to changing factors and to adjust their strategies to respond to the requirements of these developments which are becoming hard to predict.</seg>
<seg id="6">He indicated that the changes taking place in tourism require the organization to make the necessary efforts to contribute as a specialized agency in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and to give better support to member countries in implementing their developmental programs.</seg>
<seg id="7">He pointed out the need to work on exploring the best opportunities offered in the tourism sector in order to spread the benefits generated by the sector to all classes of society, and to the most impoverished regions and countries.</seg>
<seg id="8">He highlighted that the role of tourism in eradicating poverty and in sustainable development is one of the foremost reasons why the organization's executive council bears the responsibility to work toward greater cooperation between members of this organization, which has now becomea specialized agency of the United Nations.</seg>

<seg id="1">In view of the occurrence of some incidents of roguery, fraud or robbery by force, sometimes using arms, and sometimes killing, against some Saudi tourists in the recent past, especially after the exit of the Syrian army from Lebanon, there has been a lot of talk and warnings about not traveling to Syria, especially here in the arena.</seg>
<seg id="2">And I believe that the matter sometimes goes beyond the scope of the event, which is to warn about travel to Syria, by denigrating Syrians and thinking the Syrian people or the majority of them are happy with what is happening to tourists, or at least with the policy of the Syrian government.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everywhere on the face of the earth, there are bad and evil people, in Saudi Arabia, in Syria, and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this country, Saudi Arabia, we have a lot of security problems.</seg>
<seg id="5">But we have grown accustomed to turning the light onto others and we forget about ourselves and the problems that we suffer from.</seg>
<seg id="6">And should one want to confirm what I am writing, he may go and sit for only one hour in the nearest police station to his house, and see... the quantity of complaints, quarrels, rights denied, robberies, and so on....</seg>
<seg id="7">This is despite the fact that the state has now become aware of this security defect that has been ignored for years, due to the focus of security authorities on terrorism only.</seg>
<seg id="8">The evidence for this is the numerous cutting off of hands this month to get rid of the spread of robberies, which has unfortunately become a widespread phenomenon everywhere in the kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">So if we, in a rich country like Saudi Arabia, have been suffering from the spread of robberies, in secrecy, and by coercion and sometimes the use of force, do you blame poor people in their entirety because there are some criminals among them?!!</seg>

<seg id="4">We will not go far away, and we will not pass beyond the country's borders, in marking the signs of this disgraceful and shameful breakdown with respect to an issue that we spoke of when it first became apparent that it was not closely tied to our social and cultural reality.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some of us even said that those Saudi terrorists are nothing but a deluded group that did not draw their extremist Takfiri ideas and doctrine from the culture of the society.</seg>
<seg id="6">The common people of Saudi society have lived largely convinced that the misguided group has no intellectual and ideological roots and origins that nurture its thoughts and spur it to the fire and hell of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="7">So the people rejoiced with every security success, in which terrorists dropped like flies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ember of the fire of terrorism has not been extinguished despite the brilliant security successes and despite the great support for the counseling project, which has targeted many of the detainees in terrorism cases.</seg>
<seg id="9">Saudi society has been shaken because of the terrorist acts, and has thus been harmed materially and intellectually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we have started to see this quarreling and intellectual struggle between a large number of the symbols of intellectual movements, the exchange of accusations, accusations of being the agent of foreign countries and accusations against some preachers of supporting terrorism and extremists.</seg>

<seg id="9">And there is an important dimension that has been neglected that is related to the psychological and social dimension, which is about how to deal with the public.... For the matter is not about laws that are implemented... but about winning over this public....</seg>

<seg id="3">But what we see today, and what is going on in the field is hard to accept, and is very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="4">I could not believe how things changed so that guns are aimed at the brothers in arms and struggle, and %pw it is Palestinians that are turning into murderers, in fact into a helping arm of the Zionists.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, this is not strange, in fact it is expected whenever the pulpits of mosques are exploited as far as piling up inflammatory speeches, like he who is not with us, is against us.</seg>
<seg id="6">And whoever writes an article denouncing this, is then prosecuted and dealt with as a criminal. Even some clerics who tried to stop the strife, were cold-bloodedly murdered, and in front of mosques.</seg>

<seg id="11">And those people have no interest in having a settlement, so as to cover their failure in winning back their occupied lands.</seg>
<seg id="12">And now those who claimed to be nationalistic and called for the liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea, have turned into crime bosses and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="13">And after depicting those who have talks with the enemy as traitors and calling for their deaths, there they are now announcing, from the beating heart of Arabism, that Israel is a reality that must be dealt with.</seg>

<seg id="2">Increase in the use of the internet and tools of modern technology has made Moroccan society wake up from time to time to horrible moral crimes whose champions are minors and young male and female students. They appear in special sites and blogs in sexual positions that has drawn the astonishment of Moroccan public opinion at this phenomenon, especially as the first incidents cropped up in small cities that, compared to the big cities, are still closed and conservative, like Tawnat, Stat, Binkrir and al-Muhammadiya.</seg>
<seg id="3">Statistics indicate that internet use in Morocco is on the rise and spreading fast. The number of internet users reached more than 4.6 million users at the end of 2005, and this number has doubled five times during the past five years, where the number of those joining the internet has reached some 262,000, whereas this number did not exceed 31,000 in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, the number of internet clubs in Morocco, which have turned into favorite places for youth, has increased to more than 10,650 clubs. And worldwide, internet users in 2005 reached around 950,000,000 users, with a growth rate of 160% compared to 2000.</seg>

<seg id="2">We are not poor. In fact, in our country, we are rich, and our poverty is in the lack of patriotism by some of the officials among us.</seg>
<seg id="3">We have tourism and investment assets that other countries do not possess, lacking the natural assets necessary for investment in the field of tourism:</seg>
<seg id="4">A beautiful and pristine country like a young girl in her prime.</seg>
<seg id="5">Forests, seas and natural beaches that need no accoutrements, not to mention preconditions for vacation and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="6">A moderate temperature and rare golden sands, but what we lack is the clear vision for investment that can stand up among our country's many hurdles.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other bank of the Mediterranean, the Spaniards have made great strides in terms of taking advantage of the sea and beaches in a way that has led to the creation of flourishing and clean, new tourist cities. These have now made Spain, a country that recently joined the European Union, a magnet and destination for tourists from countries all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this country, especially in Andalusia, a tourist beholds what he cannot behold in our country, except in some southern cities. Tall palm trees spread all over Andalusia, planted in all of the streets, alleys, public squares, beaches, and city centers, forming a captivating view. They adorn Spanish cities and give them a dazzling image that Moroccans cannot see unless they travel to Marrakesh, and even then, they will not find it as it is in Andalusia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Beaches that do not have the beauty of Morocco's, but nonetheless, attract tourists from all over the world. In fact, these cities are no longer a Spanish possession, as much as they are a mixed possession of the British, Germans, Dutch, Moroccans, and Arabs of the East.</seg>
<seg id="10">These beaches have coarse sands, not like the fine golden sands of Morocco, but their luster has charmed some tourists, and thus they own property and reside there permanently. They visit them every year due to what Spanish tourism provides in these areas, something which we lack.</seg>

<seg id="2">One hundred and fifty Bosnian Muslim women have filed a lawsuit against the Dutch state before the supreme Dutch court in The Hague because of the Srebrenica massacre in June, 1995, as the responsibility of protecting the city fell on the shoulders of the Dutch military forces.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defense of the women victims, who are suing the Dutch state for the first time as mothers of the thousands of dead among the massacre's victims witnessed during the Bosnia-Herzegovina war against Serbia, accuses the Dutch state, represented by the military forces that were under the United Nations in the city of Srebrenica, of not having performed its duty in protecting the people of said city.</seg>
<seg id="4">And that it allowed the Serbian forces to commit massacres in a city that was under its responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="5">Where some 7,000 Muslims, including women, men, the elderly, and children, fell victim to these crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">These Bosnian women, who stated that they represent 6,000 of the victims of this massacre for whom the Dutch state holds responsibility, traveled in a bus that spent forty hours until it reached The Hague.</seg>
<seg id="7">These women hope that, through this lawsuit, the Dutch state will recognize these massacres and take responsibility for them.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Israeli escalation was not the only impetus for the Egyptian diplomacy whose movements enjoy a dimension of security, when it invited representatives of both the presidency and the Hamas movement to Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Later on, it is expected to convene a comprehensive meeting between the resistance factions under the patronage of the brothers in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="4">For there is an Egyptian regional security, first, that has constants and positions regarding what is happening in the Gaza Strip, and to some extent, there is the need, too, for both the presidency and its path and Hamas and its path to reach a common denominator, at least temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the first results that the discussions in Cairo brought forth was the replacement of some security figures and the appearance of Ismail Haniyeh after the Israeli threats against him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Secondly, there was the agreement on forming the common force and implementing the security plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Perhaps the two sides have been facing, for a number of months, some indications of a security lapse, as they used to call them.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this time, in my opinion, the pressing issues are not about facing the well-known classic forces of a security lapse in the Palestinian arena.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are new missions regarding the present challenges for both Egypt and its regional security, and also Hamas and the presidency, where the two opponents may have reached a common denominator, in simple words and without any complications, regarding the emergence of fundamentalist extremist groups in the Gaza Strip that could wreck the political program of the presidency and Hamas, as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no doubt that there is a difference in viewpoints, tactics, and strategy between the Hamas program and Al Qaeda's thinking.</seg>
<seg id="11">The program of the presidency, however, is regarded by those extremist groups, so to speak, as a program that goes totally in the interest of America and Zionism.</seg>
<seg id="12">And those groups deal with this program with the logic of takfir.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new projects increase the volume of water that is produced in al-Jizah governorate by some 346,000 additional cubic meters for the service of one million and 435 thousand citizens in the three areas, while the cost of the new projects has reached 196 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was explained by Mr. Hussein Khaled, Head of the Executive Agency for Drinking Water and Sewage in Greater Cairo and Alexandria.</seg>
<seg id="5">He pointed out that the three programs come as fulfillment of the election platform of President Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that the first project is a line from the Imbaba station to al-Rimaya, and it provides service to the Faisal street and areas adjacent to it on its western and eastern sides, as well as the area of al-Rimaya and the Pyramids' gardens, for some 360,000 people, as it is 26 kilometers long and its daily production capacity is 100,000 cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The second project is a line from the Imbaba water station to Osiem, which provides service to the city and the center of Osiem and some villages of Imbaba, north of al-Jizah, and for some 175,000 people. Its daily capacity is 36,000 cubic meters and its length, including all additions, is 10 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third project is improving drinking water north of the Pyramid, and it provides service to the inhabitants of Masakin al-Shabab, the Pyramids' hill, and north of King Faisal and the desert Cairo/Alexandria road. Its cost is 95 million pounds, its overall length is 181 kilometers, and its daily capacity is 210,000 cubic meters a day.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is worth mentioning that Mr. Mahmud 'Amer, member of the Muslim Brotherhood parliamentary bloc for the Osiem constituency, had presented a request to bring fresh water to the city of Osiem, and it was approved so that he fulfills the promises that he made to serve the people of his constituency.</seg>

<seg id="15">The revenue of the British group from this contract amounted to 43 billion pounds (84.4 billion dollars). The British group confessed that it provided "services of assistance" to Saudi officials, saying this was not illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company lawyers acknowledged providing "the services" in a letter dated in November/November 2005 that they sent to the Serious Fraud Office, which, at the time, was investigating the possibility of receiving bribes in the course of concluding the enormous "al-Yamamah" deal between Britain and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the eighties of the last century.</seg>

<seg id="3">pointing out that he does not accuse this group.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with "Al-Arabiya" satellite channel, Murad said that "Stability in Lebanon should be achieved by a national unity government, through which difficulties in security could be better overcome... and these assassination cases could come under control, and those who commit them could be arrested."</seg>
<seg id="5">Parliament Member of the Lebanese Future parliamentary bloc, Walid Eido, had been killed earlier on Wednesday in an explosion that targeted his car and also killed his son and four other people.</seg>

<seg id="3">While Prime Minister Fuad Siniora called for evacuation of civilians remaining inside the camp in preparation for what appears to be the final blow.</seg>
<seg id="4">A military source described the fighting as being more intense than usual in Nahr al-Bared camp, where the army is fighting battles for the fourth consecutive week with the Fatah al-Islam group, whose doctrine is inspired by the Al Qaeda organization.</seg>
<seg id="5">No less than 136 persons were killed, including 60 soldiers, in the most violent fighting since the civil war that broke out between 1975 and 1990, as 11 soldiers were killed and more than 100 were injured during clashes that took place at the beginning of the week.</seg>
<seg id="6">The army is engaged with the Fatah al-Islam fighters at the outskirts of the camp, which housed some 40,000 people before the fighting broke out. This forced thousands to flee, most of whom took refuge in the nearby al-Badawi camp. Evacuation of the rest of the refugees: rescue workers struggling to evacuate civilians who are still trapped inside the camp.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the meantime, the Lebanese Prime Minister, Fuad Siniora, called for the need to evacuate the civilians who have not yet left the camp "to save their lives." This is in response "with the appeals they are making."</seg>
<seg id="8">But Siniora called for caution against "the possibility of the movement of elements of Fatah al-Islam and their taking advantage of the evacuation process, so that acts of terrorism do not move outside of the camp."</seg>
<seg id="9">On another hand, the Lebanese army denied the news, suggesting that armed elements, which are believed to belong to the Fatah al-Islam organization, have staged the abduction of two Lebanese soldiers from one of the streets of Tripoli, and that those elements called for their safe exit to the Syrian borders in exchange for releasing the two abducted soldiers, vowing not to expose them to any harm.</seg>

<seg id="2">The American movie has come under the threat of disappearing from Egyptian cinema after being on top of it from the eighties until now, and the reason is the emergence of new competitors promoting European movies, especially French ones, and east Asian movies.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of the largest companies, which is well known for calculated and successful risks, has managed to get distributorship for showing Indian movies at the same time as their showing in India.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ideas differ around this issue. Antoine Zand, the distributor of American films in Egypt, stressed that showing European, Indian and Korean movies is only a temporary phenomenon, and it will end.</seg>
<seg id="5">Especially, since it is managed haphazardly, and therefore it will not last against the American film, and will not knock it off its pedastal in Egyptian cinema theatres.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zand attributed the presence of Italian movies in the sixties and Indian ones in the eighties, the best being during the period were film distributors who depended on the Italian community in Egypt, or the Egyptians of Italian origin.</seg>
<seg id="7">With respect to Indian movies, they were more organized as there was a specialized agent for this genre, and after his death these movies disappeared and had no presence after him.</seg>
<seg id="8">He stressed that the American movies will not be threatened by the "wave" of the coming movies as they are random and unorganized, and it will remain the one on top of the foreign movie pedastal in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Adel Adib, the agent in charge of the company "Good News," confirmed that he has indeed got the distributorship of Indian movies in Egypt, where the Indian movie could be shown at the same time as its showing in India, in a way regulated with the Indian companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">A plan and a study were also made for the cinema market, along with intensifying the promotional process over the next three years, and there was also a similar plan for European and Korean movies.</seg>

<seg id="4">And it stands with the Zionist entity despite its continuous refusal to implement the international resolutions that concern Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="5">The American government has not and will not exercise any pressure on India to resolve the Kashmiri cause according to the international resolutions, as it has not and will not exercise any pressure on the Zionist entity to resolve the Palestine cause according to international resolutions.</seg>

<seg id="3">What is apparent from the name of the company is that its owner did not trade with banned material, or drugs, any drugs, whether hashish, opium, or packets of locally grown marijuana that have destroyed the brains of Egyptian youth. Nor was this company one of the maritime companies specialized in sending Egyptians on a voyage to the other world by drowning them in saltwater.</seg>
<seg id="4">Al-Shurouq company was also not specialized in importing cancerous wheat, and al-Ansari did not trade in contaminated blood, nor did he fight with people to sit in their chairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">And if this was the case, why is there this attack by security on his company, its closure, and making the youth working in it homeless?</seg>
<seg id="6">Knowledgeable sources confirmed that the reason behind closing al-Shurouq Journalism Services was due to a matter of birth control (!!), for when the Ministry of Health and Population knew that there were young people at the company who were going to get married, it immediately mandated the censorship and security agencies to take control of the situation and prevent these youth from completing the marriage by closing their only source of income, and therefore preventing them from procreating so that the Prophet, prayers and peace be upon him, would not be so proud of them, the nations, on Judgment Day.</seg>
<seg id="7">The closure came one day after the allocation of 120 million pounds for the purpose of birth control (See al-Ahram, page one on the date of the set back)</seg>

<seg id="10">But let us presume that there is good will, and allow that that process of change will reach them. It is the right of the minister of higher and lower education to change presidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it is not the right of the ministry to promote this issue as being the perfect solution for the agitation problems and student clashes, as if they hold the university presidents, who were ousted from their position, responsible for what had happened, and that the act of ousting them from their positions would bring amicability back between all students....</seg>

<seg id="2">The Arab media followed very closely the elections of the Zionist Labor Party and what the results would bring. And in the name of "neutrality and presenting the other opinion" some satellite channels pooled their resources of analysts and observers to understand the election scene there, and present expectations after comparing Ehud Barak and Ami Yalon, and the preference of some of our leaders for the Barak win, and contacting him in order to encourage and support him as he is the white dove and the coming man of peace, after all the attempts and initiatives of peace have failed.</seg>

<seg id="4">Quite naturally, the communication should be at times that do not hurt the workflow or hinder it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Relationships between employees are important as they always motivate the employee to perform better, contribute to the increase in productivity, and instill the love of work in his soul.

<seg id="6">And he knows that they have become an indispensible part of his life. This may be a difficult culture for many managers and officials who are concerned about performance and productivity, more than moods and hearts.</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not care whether the employee before them is a living creature or an object, for what is always most important, significant and necessary is the results, and in the form that is agreed upon.</seg>

<seg id="7">And we do not know what is to become of those who choose artists and singers as role models despite the misfortune and decadence many of them live in!</seg>
<seg id="8">So that you will become great, you must choose a great role model who can contribute to raising the level of your thinking, glorify you, and provide you with the motive to reach the rank of that role model even for just a few steps, but providing that you take the initiative of improving yourself and that you persevere in developing and going to great lengths to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not good enough to choose a role model and sit in place without taking a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the biggest things that has contributed to the lagging behind of generations is the absence of role models in their lives. Children are raised on the role models of cartoons and fantasy drawings, and are raised on it, with the blessing of family and parents.</seg>

<seg id="2">The current situation in the land of Palestine is strange and unexpected. Every time the factions come together and agree on national unity and shared responsibility, something appears that destroys it, namely the endless back and forth fighting and skirmishes by some of the revolutionary parties in the security services of Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="3">And I believe that there are orders from important leaders, and some criminal states in the international arena may be interfering in it, at the forefront of which are America and Israel.</seg>
<seg id="4">When you switch between the Palestine Forum for Dialogue, which is a forum for Hamas supporters, and the Fathawiyeh, which is the forum of the Fatah supporters, you would be amazed at the overturning of core realities held by some factions.</seg>
<seg id="5">So the revolutionaries in the opinion of Hamas are a criminal group from Fatah, but you would find the revolutionaries in the Fatah forums to be Hamas and its government!</seg>
<seg id="6">And I do not know how a sane person would describe them as revolutionaries while they, the people with legitimacy in the Palestinian Authority, they represent the majority in the legislative and ministerial council.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some are not happy about Hamas's control and its victory over the security services, but whoever looks closely at recent circumstances would realize that those security services, headed by Dahlan, have spread corruption in the land, and have made repeated attempts to assassinate the prime minister and Hamas ministers despite signing agreements, and despite all parties in Fatah vowing not to violate the legitimacy of Hamas and its men.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's obvious that the important men in Fatah have no control over the revolutionary commands, and despite all the slogans of unity and the participation of Fatah in the unity government, the series of assassinations and the chaos in security has forced Hamas to fight corruption, and to overthrow the revolutionaries, and to kick them out of the Gaza Strip after they have crossed all red and yellow lines.</seg>

<seg id="2">Information of the Israeli Ministry of Interior confirmed that in the year 2006, 1,363 Jerusalem citizens had their Israeli citizenship taken away, which is a 500% increase over what the situation was in 2005. This is an unprecedented ratio, the highest since 1985, when the policy of withdrawing citizenship from Arab citizens of the Holy City was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="3">The organization "Betsalim" sent a request to the Israeli Ministry of Interior for the disclosure of the number of Jerusalem citizens whose citizenships had been taken away, given that 222 citizenships had been taken away in the year 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is worth mentioning that Arab citizens living in Jerusalem had been provided with a permanent residency status, which gives them the most privileges that are enjoyed by the citizens of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="5">And according to Israeli law, the Hebrew state has the right to withdraw citizenship from any Arab citizen among Jerusalem's inhabitants if they live outside the country or in areas of the Palestinian Authority.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israel has adopted the policy of taking away citizenship collectively from groups of Jerusalem's inhabitants since 1995, during the tenure of the ill-remembered Eli Suisa, who held the office of Director of the Jerusalem District in the Israeli Ministry of Interior, where the issue of canceling citizenship for Jerusalemites was exacerbated as Suisa was appointed as minister representing the fanatical party "Shas" in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="7">Suisa kept putting hurdles in front of Jerusalem's Arab citizens, requesting building licenses, which led to a severe shortage of housing homes, leading many to being forced to leave Jerusalem, something which barred them from the citizenship that was withdrawn according to the above-mentioned Israeli law.</seg>

<seg id="5">Knowing the characteristics of the time movement of genes that play a role in metabolism is vital and important to understanding how genes interact with, and how health and disease are regulated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Researcher Betitsen says For example, when following any nutritional regime, you know that food should not be eaten late at night,</seg>
<seg id="7">And we can now know why.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have discovered that all genes have specific changes in a type of activity during the day.</seg>

<seg id="2">Parliamentary sources revealed to Alakhbar today, Sunday 06/24/2007, that a decision was taken by the new Mauritanian authorities to close four important Mauritanian embassies abroad, the most notable of which is the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan, whereas the president was cautious about closing the embassy in "Tel Aviv".</seg>
<seg id="3">The source said that confirmation reached the parliament two days ago, stating that the president has decided to close the following Mauritanian embassies under financial and not political pressures. They are: The Mauritanian embassy in Jordan - the Mauritanian embassy in Japan - The Mauritanian embassy in Britain - the Mauritanian embassy in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meanwhile, he refused to close the Mauritanian embassy in "Tel Aviv" despite the fact that its financial cost was about "20 million ouguiya" in 2005. This is due to its political nature, which has raised a lot of debate during the past years between the opposition and the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">The same sources said that there is a general feeling inside parliament that opposes this decision, especially with the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan being more important, as there is a Mauritanian community in Jordan, especially among students.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, the economic activity and political nature of the embassy makes its closure at a time when there is an ambassador in Tel Aviv, (perhaps he would take over the affairs of the community in Jordan), would be regarded as shameful and harmful to inter-Arab relations, especially with it being the first time that a decision of this sort is made, after the closure of the Mauritanian embassy in Iraq, after the former Iraqi president was accused of shaking the security inside Mauritania, according to the parliamentary sources.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Mauritanian government needs the parliament to endorse the budget of any Mauritanian embassy abroad within the general government budget, which is set to be presented to the parliament in an emergency session.</seg>
<seg id="8">But parliamentary sources excluded the new parliament's approval of the budget of the Mauritanian embassy in "Tel Aviv" as this is considered a waste of the people's property in a matter that they reject from the beginning.</seg>

For us, however, the defeat of June 5, 1967, still chases us.</seg>
<seg id="3">The modern history of the Arabic world in general, and the Arabic east, in particular, is a series of events that took shape and was organized with them being considered the results of that defeat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat created profound influences on the whole of Arab life, for it was not only a military defeat that the Arabic armies suffered, but a total defeat for all members of Arab society, as it was a test of "the socialism" that had been built, the "development" that had been achieved, and of the "security state" that had been built.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whatever it was, the defeat was a sign for change in the direction of events towards further Arab decline, and was a historic turning point whose dynamism has started to become much clearer since the 70s of last century until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The defeat was not a passing moment in Arab life. It put all Arab peoples in a decline, from which the war of October / October 1973 did not rescue them, as it turned into a political defeat whose challenges spread in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of which is that Arab societies, which attained some modernization, have declined to the worst point of their history, i.e. to a way of political life that is closest to the way of life in the Mamluk/Ottoman era, whose most notable feature was the separation of government from the people, the separation of the society from the state, the stagnation of society and the stultification of its internal history, and the dominance of a traditional ideology that strengthens dependence, obedience, inability, reluctance, and fear.</seg>

<seg id="12">Yes, this would look correct on the face of it, but practically speaking, in reality, I do not find it laudable in my opinion.</seg>

<seg id="2">The one who reflects on the circumstances of this country knows that its crisis is enormously complex and complicated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of the vital sectors, if not all, suffer from serious flaws and dangerous setbacks day after day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Moroccan university would not be an exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also suffers from many and numerous crises that are hard to list or count.</seg>
<seg id="6">A problem in one of the Moroccan universities does not occur until a crisis is clear and its lines and form are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is what happened in the past few days when violent clashes broke out in the "Ibn Zahr university" in Agadir between Sahrawi students and others belonging to the Amazighan cultural movement.</seg>
<seg id="8">These clashes soon moved to a large number of Moroccan universities, like Marrakesh, Casablanca, and al-Rashidiyah.</seg>
<seg id="9">The situation in the latter was more dangerous and tense, as it saw the death of one of the students due to these barbaric incidents that lack reason and are without logic.</seg>
<seg id="10">One university and uninterrupted violence:</seg>
<seg id="11">In the 70s of the past century, the leftist movement controlled the Moroccan university, which made the Moroccan students' movement rally around socialist and communist ideas, which saw a great revival at the time with the presence of the superpower at the time, the Soviet Union which promoted the concept of revolution and overthrowing, and which supported them financially.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is what made the majority of the students adopt and defend those ideas. What's more, the students were in fact the driving force behind the socialist and communist tide that the world witnessed at the time, along with the working classes.</seg>
<seg id="13">And at the time, it was opposed to the sphere and did not rally within its orbit, exposing it to barbaric violence that reached its uppermost limits.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some here in Kuwait believe that the role of the "local intellectual" should not go beyond of the scope of feeling estrangement in the local environment and of lasting outrage at the general circumstances, if those circumstances do not coincide with the personal ambitions of the intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what we know about the role of the intellectual is that he should bear on his shoulders two comparable loads; one bears the message of talking about the concerns of normal citizen and another looks into the future optimistically and cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="4">Within this scope, we do not think that the intellectual is required to build the feeling of estrangement in the local environment as a fixed rubric for his traditional and enlightening role.</seg>
<seg id="5">It means, we must acknowledge that some of us have gotten into the habit of apparently appearing in the roles of those eternally outraged against their "underdeveloped" societies, according to their description of the environment where they grew up, and that they, that is, those who are outraged, should not expect anything other than what is tragic and dark in the general march of the society that they belong to.</seg>
<seg id="6">Others only appear as long as they believe that there are positive aspects to their societies, and close their eyes on what must be corrected and fixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you see this other type of local intellectuals appear as if they live in la-la land, or in a permanently optimistic, smiling, and happy utopia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rationalism or the traditional area in which the local intellectual in Kuwait works, must be "balanced" and tell others about what is negative.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a role that also goes in parallel with presenting practical solutions to daily problems that the Kuwaiti society faces, and at the same time, the local intellectual should tell of a coming future that will be happy, successful and full of hope should this or that direction, which is suggested by the intellectual, be followed.</seg>

<seg id="3">She is Mrs. Aisha Abdulhadi, Minister of Workforce and Immigration, and she is also the originator of the idea of opening the largest slavery market in the Arab world!!!!!</seg>
<seg id="4">Yes, she is bringing back the era of slavery and the slave trade once again.</seg>
<seg id="5">And who are those slaves in this market?</seg>
<seg id="6">They are our mothers, women, sisters, and daughters. The auction and market are held to bring 120,000 Egyptian maids into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, namely the daughters of Egypt, to serve in houses.</seg>

<seg id="2">From time to time, calls are raised accusing Shiites of a lack of patriotism and that their allegiance is for Iran and not for their countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">And this false accusation is of course due to a number of reasons, but the most notable reason is that some of those who make the calls are ignorant of the fact that the basis for the difference in allegiance is due to the concept of the Imamate or Shura, and then there is the secondary concept of allegiance to the ruler or allegiance to the land.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those others who accuse the Shiites of allegiance to Iran ignore the law of nature that says that a human being, whether Shiite or Sunni, innately loves the country in which he grew up.</seg>
<seg id="5">One who looks a bit deeper into history finds that accusing the Shiites of non-allegiance is not recent, but it is hundreds of years old, and its origin goes back to the fact that the Shiites believe in the theory of the Imamate, while the Sunnis believe in the theory of Shura.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this is of course not the time to explain the theory of the Shiite or the Sunnis, but I say that after the disappearance of the Imam Muhammad bin al-Hassan (May God hasten his return), who is the Shiites' twelfth Imam, the Shiites had to consult scholars for whom a number of conditions hold true, according to the last letter of the Imam al-Mahdi (May God hasten his return), before he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="7">This scholar whom they should all consult, could be from Saudi Arabia, Iran, or Afghanistan, because the conditions mention the characteristics of the scholar and not his nationality, while the Sunnis continued to rule according to the theory of Shura, and they believe that the ruler is the one to whom allegiance is a necessity, whether this ruler was pious or corrupt. After a period of time, after the failure of the movement of the nationalists and at the height of the Islamic awakening, a Sunni movement appeared, which is the Brotherhood.</seg>

<seg id="2">I was quite startled by the story of the criminal who shot his wife and four daughters in Riyadh, which resulted in the death of the mother, three of the daughters, and the entry of the fourth into intensive care....</seg>
<seg id="3">To the extent that I kept trying to think, for three nights, about what state of mind and what heart had he been able to trap his daughters and wife, kill them and report the crime in all meanness... and all coldness, as if he had killed four chickens!!</seg>
<seg id="4">Why did the devil, who suggested to him to kill these women, not suggest to him to kill himself, as well; let him blow out his brains and lay side by side with his daughters... whose blood he shed in all cruelty?</seg>
<seg id="5">My opinion is that the devil suggested something else to him, which is that he is a man who relies on a sturdy wall in a society that gives the man the right to control a woman's life in general.</seg>
<seg id="6">So what difference would it make if he could also take her soul!!?</seg>
<seg id="7">Is the impudence and the boldness through which this criminal attacked his wife and daughters a natural reaction to the phenomena of violence and obvious discrimination from which the Saudi woman suffers, until this matter has started to threaten her with death at the hands of her own people!?</seg>
<seg id="8">I believe that the judicial ruling that is to be issued should bring capital punishment against this criminal who has spilt the blood of four faultless women.</seg>
<seg id="9">This ruling should deter and be decisive, and not accept the fabrication of pretexts through which he can justify his deed, under the pretext of mental illness or honor, for example, and get away with it.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling should deter all those mentally ill people who have criminal tendencies, whose imaginations would be stirred up by this genre of stories and would be determined to spill the blood of their women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The time has come for when the dream would start to ask its nearly inaudible questions, and lips smile at stories that people have grown bored of believing.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was thinking like this when hope pretended that all past defeats would end, simply due to a new battle breaking out.</seg>
<seg id="4">My wound was not due to frustration, but was the result of the silence that passed everything, even replacing the poems of Iraqi poets with the bombs of American shelling, or with the bullets of the ruling militia in a country that had the precedent of legislating the first law of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The corpses of the victims that are being sold in the Iraq of American-Iranian death are nothing but other stabs, for nothing remained for the living that was not humbled.</seg>
<seg id="6">And now it is the time for the dead to pay the price for being Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Iraq is paying for a historic leveling of scores; the American administration and Iran have shrouded under democratic promises and a keen interest in the welfare of the people of Iraq, who are being killed daily with American and Iranian weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">If Iran is still enraged with the Arabs for wiping out the state of Khosrau during the tenure of Omar bin al-Khattab, then the Persian hatred remains for the Just Caliph and for Arabs, a part of beliefs and ceremonies that are best called Safavi</seg>
<seg id="9">then the American administration is captive to the desire to destroy Arabs, pillage their riches and realize the Israeli dream.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is happening in Iraq on a daily basis is not a struggle for influence between powers only, but is an annihilation in the full sense of the word of a people whose memory is full of pain, and for the Arabism of this country, where Arabs had their greatest historical roles when Baghdad became a capital for the caliphate.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is nothing new for us to say that President Mubarak is distinguished as the president of fraudulent elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">There has not taken place, not even by coincidence, the holding of elections or referenda that were neither fraudulent nor false during his tenure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the fraud of the latest Advisory Council elections was more audacious and most brazen.</seg>
<seg id="6">And despite the fragility of this council and despite the foolishness and insignificance of the Egyptian parliamentary life, first and foremost, and despite the fact that the members of the Parliament and Advisory council are not representatives of the nation as much as they appear as representatives of it and on its behalf, and the fact that most of them are employees in the service of President Mubarak personally, or in the service of the state security service.

<seg id="9">I say this so that you know that even if fifty opposition candidates succeed in the Advisory Council election, they will neither consult anyone nor change a thing.</seg>

<seg id="11">The end result is that I would like draw the kind attention of those observing the elections to the fact that fraud this time, with its uncharacteristic brazenness, which has reached a degree of triviality, what is triviality? Namely, the lack of shame, and it reveals the mentality that governs Egypt....</seg>

<seg id="9">And because me being a student in the history department, I will tell you what happened, so that I may hopefully be a shining lamp for anyone who wants reform.</seg>

<seg id="11">The details of this is that curricula were deleted and others were put in their places so that the student in the third year, for example, would study four curricula in term one and eight in term two.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among those curricula are those that are not specialized and have got nothing to do with the department.</seg>

<seg id="2">* Poetry is a type of literature, a pot into which the poet pours all his vicissitudes by day and by night. It is the mirror of the soul, the sap of the intellect, the contradictions between the mind and the soul.</seg>
<seg id="3">As is well-known, literature teaches and entertains, as the two sides of an eternal equation that is impossible to solve.</seg>
<seg id="4">Poetry is steadfast until the Final Judgment and will not pause before an era or some difficulty. In fact, it is the difficulty that pauses before it, the ambush of the soul, as well as the secrets of nature, the inducements of ideas, the sleeplessness that slips away, and the language that flourishes from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="5">* It makes clear the state of mind of the poet, who rolls between the higher and lower tides.</seg>
<seg id="6">The poet is a complex, unusual creature, in whose person many persons are collected.</seg>
<seg id="7">He alone is capable of programming a yes for every (no) and vice versa. He is alone capable of turning a desert into a green orchard, and the orchard into a fire that burns the feet of those who step into it.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is this one, a creature who lives at all stretches of time, and we perceive him, but he only perceives us through his texts that embrace our dreams and soften our wounds.</seg>
<seg id="9">The poet is a human being who is very sensitive toward things. He even feels the inanimate; he feels them while we do not.</seg>
<seg id="10">He prophesizes everything. He writes us and reads us at the same time....</seg>
<seg id="11">He broadcasts the oscillations of his creativity across continents so that he remains alone, surrounded by hundreds, in fact thousands of people....</seg>
<seg id="12">He enjoyed and still enjoys a lofty position in his society. Do we not see them, since the pre-Islamic era took care of the poet, with regards to transmitters? It is, indeed, as though he were the tongue of the tribe, and today he is the tongue of the world. His works have reached the global stage.</seg>

<seg id="3">The current union, which was established a few years ago and was regarded by many activists in this field as the balm that has the ability to correct the embarrassing, even disgusting, situation of those working in the written media sector, has experienced a number of difficulties that prevented it from adopting the demands of its affiliates and entering into the battle of defending them.</seg>

<seg id="16">I discovered ways of cheating that never crossed my mind. And not only cheating ways, but also the mood of the student being tested, until cheating became a culture, its ways and techniques exchanged by students, and they distinguish between the easy and the strict teacher.</seg>
<seg id="17">The lucky ones are those who are watched over by an easy teacher. In fact they would envy each other for that.</seg>

<seg id="2">A notable managerial phenomenon was jokingly presented to me by one of the most important businessmen, and I pose it here in the form of a direct question.... Why do smart people not last in their jobs?</seg>
<seg id="3">And my answer here, ever so simply, is because their managers are less smart....</seg>
<seg id="4">How?</seg>
<seg id="5">A smart person in the field of business does not seek limited income nor shallow assignments, but looks to the depths of strategic visions so that he contributes to building himself, if he is selfish, or building himself and his society, if he is bold. And this one and that one know precisely the details of the path they are traveling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Creative people agree on determining the limits to the stages of their financial, social, and cognitive development, and this is different from one creative person to the other, according to the flow of creative energy within their veins.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some set a period of 2 years as a phase for development and others set 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whereas others set 20 to 30 years as a development phase, and here their progress towards the peak of success would be slower than others.</seg>
<seg id="9">Smart people are distinguished to a large extent by their ability to change, and the capability to go forward and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are a part of the 3% who are currently leading the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is not easy, as they lack financial stability, and are more susceptible to criticism and mockery due to the number of setbacks they face in their lives.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they swiftly control the situation that makes the other 97% open their mouths in awe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patience is one of the qualities of the smart ones, but this does not mean that they would stay under control for periods that we would call stable, due to their being characterized as mostly rebellious....</seg>
<seg id="14">Their patience depends on the time it takes for ideas to mature in their minds, and the presence of opportunities to implement them....</seg>
<seg id="15">Smart ones accept the sacrifice of the precious in order to reach the most precious....</seg>

<seg id="7">Whereas we all know the system that is followed in our country for members to reach the parliament (which, along with the Council of Ministers are the way to the Shura council, is artificial in its process and performance in our country).</seg>
<seg id="8">Where money, partisanship, and tribe play a very important role in the heated competition to reach the council. And according to which some illiterate and semi-educated people reach the parliament, as well as those who are culturally shallow and have little knowledge and those who are of no value to the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, many of them fail to attend most of the sessions, and belonging to the parliament for them becomes simply a noteworthy governmental office for them and a diplomatic passport of which they can boast in front of people.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there is a very big difference in the two pursued routes regarding having and receiving influence. Thus the Saudi Shura council, for example, is a scientific technocrat council that is able to present strong and important ideas for the society and rulers over there, as it is formed from the highest people in society in terms of science, knowledge, and intelligence, for whom neither money, tribe, nor partisanship played any role in bringing them to their offices, but instead it was their scientific and educational levels and their experience and status.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, in our parliament, we know some parliamentarians whom we have never heard speak for a whole year; in fact they do not attend in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="12">And even in their attendance and presence, we find partisan blocs directly affecting, to a large extent, the views of many members, so we hear opinions that agree with the opinions of their bloc, whether right or wrong, whether in the ruling party or in the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">And from another point of view, the Saudi Shura system focuses on respecting the present ruling system, the personality of the ruler, and presenting him with counsel and advice as a good inner circle.</seg>
<seg id="14">Partisanship is regarded as a crime, and pluralism is rejected, and no one in the Shura council would seek to compete with the ruler or distort his image.</seg>

<seg id="2">In a cultural salon that gathered a number of businessmen and journalists, a debate about the image of a businessman in society took place.</seg>
<seg id="3">And whether a businessman has to be corrupt and reach where he is through manipulation and making suspicious deals, through a marriage between fortune and power?</seg>
<seg id="4">And I asked for a specific definition of a businessman: is he a man of finance, a man of industry, or a broker?</seg>
<seg id="5">Engineer Mu'taz Rislan, head of the Egyptian-Canadian Association of Businessmen, surprised me with a strange answer that crossed no one's mind... that the businessman is all of that.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the definition of the businessman would include much more than that, for everyone who presents or sells a service is a businessman....</seg>
<seg id="7">And he said that the journalist and the writer is a businessman, because he sells his ideas to the reader and gets a return for that, and therefore what is applicable to the image of the businessman is applicable to the image of the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most of the participants agreed that there is some sort of a relation between wealth and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="9">But it is not a condition that every rich person is necessarily corrupt, and that he made his wealth through bribery and exploitation of influence in illegal ways.</seg>
<seg id="10">And I tried from my side to give a political dimension to the subject....</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the one responsible for the corruption of businessmen and distorting their image in society is the corrupt ruling system, as it allows some businessmen to move from the position of the deprived to the position of the millionaires, by facilitating deals in selling land or selling some public sector companies....</seg>
<seg id="12">Some participants gave examples of that, with the sale of Al-Ahram Beverages Company, the sale of Qaha food company, and others.</seg>

<seg id="3">No way.</seg>
<seg id="4">I wish all the best to everyone to try and find as much as possible symbols in all fields.</seg>
<seg id="5">I did as such, but I only found two symbols: the crescent and the camel. I therefore decided not to search for symbols for Egypt and instead I would try to understand the symbols it already has, perhaps I could have understood previously, that for reasons related to my nastiness and mischievous intent,</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to hit a chair at the blessed Farah club, "The Egyptian Today," in her blessed third year in which she chose to search for Egypt's symbols in this blessed epoch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let me ask her and ask her blessed readers, why does Egypt need symbols while it has its biggest symbol who lights up its night, blesses its daytime, leads its march toward glory, plows, so to say, the waves of the seas, cultivates with his wisdom the deserts, plucks with his hand its fruits, and removes the bitterness out of its face?</seg>

<seg id="13">After all these years, we have achieved nothing but changing the "Or" of choice with the "And" of conjoining. In the 50s, we remained in disagreement for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Do we count on trustworthy people or experienced people?</seg>
<seg id="15">And after the June defeat we spent longer years disagreeing on whether we had a set back because of relying on trustworthy people or experienced people.</seg>
<seg id="16">At last, we resolved the dispute, so we abolished trust and experience altogether and ended up counting only on hope.</seg>

<seg id="2">We come across the term Yezidi nationality every now and then in the Bahzani.net page.</seg>
<seg id="3">To start, I say to all those who promote this term that all Yezidis get quite embarrassed with the brothers who debate the issue of religion and nationality with them, despite the fact that people are not responsible for your incorrect reading of the subject matter.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is not logical to say something when you have no convincing proof of the validity  of what you are claiming.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yezidism is a religion and not a nationality, and we do not need a new heresy that seeks to integrate a religion and nationality under one name, which does not exist in all countries of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to my knowledge, God did not create a nation under that name as yet. Therefore it is a heresy that is newly created.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let the promoters of this heresy tell us how they reached that?</seg>
<seg id="8">And what is their realistic proof?</seg>
<seg id="9">And how come it was formed and born now?</seg>
<seg id="10">And we shall see whether you would be able to stand and defend it and everything you believe, or whether you would stop talking.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the old days an idea similar to this was generated by the Yezidis of Armenia who migrated from Qars, Wan, and Ararat, and it was a reaction to the prosecution they were subject to, due to the policy of the racist Ottoman state.</seg>
<seg id="12">It managed to motivate some Muslim Kurds to implement their plan, so they used their religious feeling and deceived them, which resulted in them paying the price for that deceit until now.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea at the time was with our people, we are Yezidis and that's it. But their thinkers and chiefs discovered the error of this position and managed to convince people and those responsible for spreading the idea and promoting it.</seg>
<seg id="14">What is known about Yezidis is that they are part of the Kurdish people. They say that they are Kurds, but not Muslims, and this is what is proved by the realistic and neutral history writers.</seg>

<seg id="2">The case of the Moroccan citizen, who turned a public lavatory into a home for his family in the city of Salé, aroused strong disapproval by the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="3">Especially as the authorities provided him with an address that he carries on his national identity card, which officially recognizes his residence by the Ministry of Interior, which found no problem in issuing a national identity card that has the address of a lavatory.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thereby ignoring the principles of human rights and human dignity, throwing all the emblems the state raises out the window.</seg>
<seg id="5">But what provoked me is that when Al-Jazeera channel hosted the head of the civil group of Salé, Bab al-Mreisseh, to investigate the situation, the Moroccan official was faltering under the barrage of questions posed by the news presenter.</seg>
<seg id="6">As he explained nothing and only said that the group has documents indicating that said person is only an attendant for those toilets, nothing more, even though he was forced to live there and prevented people from using it.</seg>

<seg id="10">In short, this official presented no explanation. What's more, he repeated the mistakes and stumbles of the likes of those who stay awake all night for "serving the citizen." It is indeed a blatant human and social scandal.</seg>
<seg id="11">And this is proven by reasoning and proof, and more than that by the admission of the General Administration of National Security, which issues national identity cards, and above it, naturally, is the Ministry of Interior. And this scandalous reasoning is aimed at those who claim that Morocco has moved forward</seg>

<seg id="2">After Secretary General of the League of Arab States Amr Moussa visited Lebanon heading an official delegation in order to examine the situation in Lebanon and meet with Lebanese leadership in order to exchange and listen to different points of view, reach to the extent possible an agreed formula that the parties would perhaps gather around to serve internal Lebanese affairs, and attempt to end what is taking place at the edges of Nahr al-Bared, which has become "hot" after the latest incidents there....</seg>
<seg id="3">After all that, many thought, in fact the politicians of wounded Lebanon relied on the visit to contribute, if only a little to "shaking" things up and bringing back what Lebanon has been missing since the time of establishing security and stability. But the matter did not go as desired by the "ship sails" of the captains of Lebanese politics.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if Moussa stayed in Lebanon a month and more, instead of a day or two, he would have certainly not been able to achieve what is sought by the Lebanese people, who are still bleeding their innocent blood on their land that is thirsty for fresh water and not for spilt blood.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is no longer hidden from anyone that external arms are controlling the threads of the game, and I would not be revealing a secret in that the captains of the Lebanese ship are in desperate need of abandoning their positions and of turning their attention to the end result, which is about the Lebanese people meeting under one phrase entitled "the security of Lebanon".</seg>

<seg id="9">"The detention and interrogation missions in the prison will continue," said the American leadership, in response to calls to close this prison.

<seg id="1">Russian businessman Andre Lugovoy, who was accused by Britain of murdering former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, accused London of the same thing yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Lugovoy denied any link to the murder of the agent, saying that the British intelligence service and Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky are the most probable suspects.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Britain is using me as a scapegoat," in Litvinenko's case, said Lugovoy, who was also an agent for the Soviet intelligence service, in a press conference broadcast on Russian television yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lugovoy began his speech by announcing that the British intelligence service had already succeeded in recruiting the deceased Litvinenko and Berezovsky, the exiled billionaire in London.</seg>
<seg id="5">He stated that Litvinenko had confessed to him about his recruitment and that he had told Berezovsky to cooperate with the British intelligence and to hand over the documents he had from the Russian national security council, of which he was secretary general at the time of former President Boris Yeltsin. The council played a role to facilitate the acquisition of the right to political asylum in Britain and, later, British nationality.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lugovoy admitted that he did not know for sure who had murdered his former colleague with the radioactive substance, polonium, in London last November, but he stated that three parties are probable suspects: British intelligence, the Mafia, and the billionaire, Berezovsky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The British authorities have refused to respond directly to Lugovoy's statements. A British Foreign Ministry spokesman simply said, "This is a criminal case, not an intelligence issue. A British citizen was killed in London, and the lives of British citizens and visitors were endangered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Britain's movement to grant Berezovsky the right to political asylum angered Moscow, which wanted him to be extradited to face criminal charges in Russia. Berezovsky appeared to be Putin's biggest opposition, after admitting that he wanted to finance a revolution to change the government in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="1">Baku - Reuters: An American official said yesterday that the United States is holding talks with Iraq and Turkey, in order to collect investments with the aim of  resuming the production and export of Iraqi gas to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2">Deputy Assistant to the American Secretary of State Matthew Pereza said in a press conference in Baku that Iraq may be linked to the Baku-Ardrom pipeline between Azerbaijan and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The United States is hastening to set conditions in Iraq for investors willing to fund the resumption of gas production there," he added.</seg>
<seg id="4">He added that Turkey, Iraq, and the United States intend to continue talks on the development of the Iraqi energy sector, following a previous round of talks last March.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There are no assessments thus far of the amount of investment required for the gas infrastructure in Iraq," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It will be necessary, however, to invest in improving the existing infrastructure, despite problems related to ensuring its security."</seg>
<seg id="7">Ilhami Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, told the conference two days ago, on Tuesday, that his country will increase its gas production to 16 billion cubic-meters in 2008, up from 12 billion cubic-meters this year, and will begin exporting on a large scale to Europe via the Baku-Ardrom pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most of the oil delivered by the pipeline will come from the giant Azerbaijani Shakh Deniz Field in the Caspian Sea, run by the British BP, the Norwegian Schtat-Oil, the Russian Lukoil, the French Total, and the Iranian and Turkish national companies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pumping Iraqi gas through the pipeline will add a new source of gas supply to Europe and weaken the dominance of the Russian company, Gazprom, which will increase its share of 25 percent of the European market with coming contracts.</seg>

<seg id="1">I am surprised at the Arab media silence about the unwelcome visit of hurricane Juno to the Gulf coasts,</seg>
<seg id="2">and I hope that thought and contemplation are the motive behind this silence, and not amazement and a cover-up.</seg>
<seg id="3">Regardless of the reason, I believe that the subject of the hurricane's surprise visit should be taken seriously, because it would send a message that we should receive and read well, in order to understand its essence and lessons before it is too late.</seg>
<seg id="4">First and foremost, we should thank God that the hurricane was not as powerful and fierce as the famous tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Asian and American coasts two years ago and caused widespread devastation and destruction, from whose effects they have not yet recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is true that the Sultanate of Oman was harmed somehow, and so was Iran, but this harm cannot be compared to what the aforementioned hurricanes had caused.</seg>
<seg id="6">Omani reports and statements spoke of the death of 49 people and considered 27 others lost.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also destroyed the main roads and bridges connecting the eastern states to the capital of Muscat and caused floods and avalanches.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, it affected crude oil exports from the Port of Al-Fahl and stopped gas exports from the Port of Sur. It also submerged a limited number of villages.</seg>
<seg id="9">By the time the hurricane reached southern Iran, its power had relatively weakened, and its victims were no more than 12 dead and nine lost. The floods displaced 40,000 residents in four regions, where roads, bridges, and houses were damaged.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the coasts of other gulf states remained far from the hurricane's path, which protected them from its effects, that is another blessing for which we should thank God.</seg>

<seg id="9">The main goal of the state of Israel has always been to be a peaceful, democratic, Jewish state, where these values survive in harmony, not animosity.</seg>
<seg id="10">These values are what lead us to believe in the vision of two states - Israel and Palestine - living side by side in security and peace, and to achieve a true and honest peace with all of our neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="11">We do not have a desire to control the lives of Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="12">Palestinian terrorists target Israelis, and we should defend ourselves against them.</seg>
<seg id="13">It should be understoof that when Palestinian terrorists targeted Israelis, they brought disaster to the Palestinians, as the recent incidents in Gaza have shown.</seg>
<seg id="14">While the terrorists claim that they are pushing the interests of the Palestinians forward, they have only succeeded in holding them back.</seg>
<seg id="15">Israel has a deeply-rooted interest, which we share with moderates all over the region, in creating a stable, flourishing, and peaceful partner, committed to working for the development of the Palestinian state and unopposed to the Jewish state. As we have shown in implementing the plan of separation from Gaza,</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel is willing to take painful steps in order to achieve this goal. We need to know, however, that our partners are also agreeable to a historic reconciliation and that our sacrifices will achieve permanent peace and security. We also deserve a political horizon.</seg>
<seg id="17">The principle of two states for two peoples is not a new principle; in spite of that, its deeper meaning is not always appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The establishment of the state of Israel provided the response for the historic and national aspirations of the Jewish people, for those of whom who were living in the holy land or outside it, for the refugees who fled the sufferings and calamities of the Nazi disaster, and for those who left Arab and other countries or were expelled from them.</seg>

<seg id="4">The steering committee supervising the project has approved the technical report which was presented by a team from the Public Railways Organization and its consultants, UBS Bank, Al-Ahli Commercial Bank, and the French Railways Company (SNCFI).</seg>
<seg id="5">The six groups include operators, investors, and industrial members who can implement and supervise the entire project. The winning group will get to build and operate the project for 50 years, and then will return it to the Saudi government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The organization has set the condition that the operating electric trains should move at relatively high speeds (exceeding 250 kilometers per hour) and that the trains must pass by several stations while linking the three cities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project also will link King Abdulaziz Airport and Jeddah Islamic Port to the holy places.</seg>
<seg id="8">The project is considered to be the second branch of a number of projects to extend the organization, which was approved by the Saudi Supreme Economic Council, with regards to passenger transportation, as 15 million passengers are expected to be transported each year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The organization has allocated the first line (the ground bridge) for commercial transportation, as it links the country's east and west, passing by the capital Riyadh, and divides to link mineral fields in the north and the Jubail Industrial City as well, with the main line, which extends from King Abdulaziz Port in the city of Dammam to Jeddah Islamic Port on the Red Sea.</seg>

<seg id="5">Documents issued by the Special Court for Sierra Leone dated this June 21, however, confirmed that Taylor "does not intend to defend himself," and that he was looking for a new defense team.</seg>
<seg id="6">Taylor had demanded more time and the means to find a lawyer capable of defending his interests in this extremely complicated case.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taylor, 59, has been detained in The Hague for nearly a year and faces 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</seg>

<seg id="4">Al-Gaddafi welcomed the high level of attendance, which reflects the importance that member-states lend to the Community of Sahel-Saharan States, noting the growing importance of this organization in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thirteen presidents of community member-states came to Sirte (450 km east of Tripoli). These are Sudan, Chad, Somalia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Central Africa, Togo, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea-Bissau.</seg>
<seg id="6">The President of the Comoros Islands, Ahmed Abdullah Sambi, also attended the summit on the occasion of the Union of the Comoros Islands joining the community, unlike Guinean President Lansana Conte, who did not attend in person and assigned his prime minister, Lansana Kouyaté, to represent him.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Senegalese people will elect their members of parliament, three months after the re-election of their president, Abdullah Wad, in legislative elections which the major opposition parties are boycotting.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is an unprecedented boycott in the history of Senegal, and the percentage of participation in these elections will show its size.</seg>
<seg id="4">Babker Giye, the chief of an eleven-organization coalition from the civil community, believes that, "The biggest gamble in these elections, on the political level, is the percentage of participation."</seg>

<seg id="8">In response, the "Sobe" alliance, (which means "change" in the Wolof language, the most common in the country,) which includes the Senegalese Democratic Party, under the leadership of Wad and his allies, is confident of winning the legislative elections, in which 17 parties and alliances are participating.</seg>
<seg id="9">The election campaign, which did not gain the interest of voters, ended Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Major opposition figures, including, in particular, former prime ministers Idris Seck, Mustapha Niasse, and Othman Tanor Ding, came successively in the second, fourth and third stages in the presidential elections. President Wad won in the first round of the presidential elections on February 25, receiving 90.55 percent of the votes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amman 6/6/2007 (AFP) - In recent months, the Jordanian authorities have revealed 81 illegal cases of human organ transplants in Jordan. Accordingly, a number of those involved in the case have been arrested, according to a spokesman for the Commission to Promote Human Organ Transplantation and Donation.</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the "Jordan Times" newspaper quoted Moumen Al-Hadidi, the chief of the commission, who said, "Authorities have uncovered 81 cases of trafficking in recent months." He added that a number of Jordanians had been arrested in May for enticing people to sell their kidneys to clients outside Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="3">"These people work on the basis of commissions and prey on poor people in order to convince them to sell their kidneys. They facilitate their travel to a third country where the operations are performed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Most of the donors were between the ages of 20 and 40 years and were lured by the idea of making quick money," he added, noting that the one kidney is sold for $3,000.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al-Hadidi said that most of those who sold their kidneys were among the poor and unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is noted that organ trafficking is banned in Jordan, and those who break the law face a punishment of five years in prison and the payment of a fine of JD20,000 ($28,000).</seg>
<seg id="7">In May, Jordanian Minister of Health Saad Al-Kharabsha announced the establishment of a supreme national commission to reduce the phenomenon of human organ trafficking and to encourage Jordanians to donate their organs after death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Nearly 800 people die every year in road accidents in Jordan. We should encourage relatives of these victims to donate the organs of their loved ones. This way we can reduce demand," said Al-Hadidi.</seg>

<seg id="4">"We are dealing with people who might be dangerous, as they throw stones," said the spokesman, noting that, "The police had used water cannons to drive them away from the fence, which they had approached."</seg>
<seg id="5">"The total number of demonstrators is nearly 9,000 people," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">An official in the "G8-Block" organization, which opposes globalization, noted that the police had used tear gas, in addition to water cannons, to disperse the demonstrators. The police did not confirm this.</seg>
<seg id="7">The demonstration led to the closing of a police crossing after demonstrators blocked a number of roads close to the 12-kilometer fence. They also blocked the coastal railways used to transport journalists from the media center in Kuehlungsborn, hundreds of meters away from Heiligendamm.</seg>
<seg id="8">Media representatives were forced to board German navy boats, which transported them to the location of the summit, while a number of helicopters monitored the area from the air.</seg>
<seg id="9">The German judiciary banned gatherings near the security fence that isolated Heiligendamm from the world.</seg>

<seg id="3">The source said that Kouchner will meet with the "Sudanese authorities" to discuss with them "bilateral relations, regional issues, and the situation in Darfur," without clarifying whether he will meet with Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir.</seg>
<seg id="4">He added that it is not on the agenda at the time being that Kouchner would visit Darfur in western Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="5">The French Minister has made the Darfur case "his priority" since his appointment less than three weeks ago, but it seemed that he had retreated from the idea of establishing "a humanitarian pathway" starting from Chad to help civilian residents.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Kouchner, who supports the principle of "meddling for humanitarian causes" admitted that he was not "totally sure" of the possibility of establishing a humanitarian pathway originating from Chad. He noted that the pathway which is being discussed is nothing more than an air bridge in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Thursday, Kouchner will start an African tour which will take him in the first station to Mali, where he will attend the inauguration ceremony of Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure on Friday. He will also make use of his presence in Bamako to meet with a number of African presidents.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the source, Kouchner will visit Chad on Saturday and Sunday and will head to the east of the country on Saturday to discuss the situation of the displaced and refugees.</seg>

<seg id="10">Eastern Chad houses nearly 4,000 Sudanese refugees from Darfur and displaced persons from Chad.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Darfur region has been witnessing an ongoing struggle since 2003 between insurgent groups and Sudanese forces backed by Arab militias.

<seg id="4">It seems that the two missiles are surface-to-sea or sea-to-sea types with a range of 100 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="5">He added that the two missiles reached areas inside the regional waters of North Korea and considers it a "routine" test akin to the one North Korea conducts every year.</seg>

<seg id="4">If the parliament were to withdraw trust from the Oil Minister, he would automatically be considered to have resigned.

<seg id="3">Gordon Brown, who is expected to succeed Blair as prime minister on June 27, has considered deeming the memorandum unsuitable.</seg>
<seg id="4">"This is not the right time to even think about an investigation, when the goal is to unify all efforts in order to support our troops on the ground," Brown said in an interview with British "Sky News" television during his visit to Iraq on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="6">"It is not true that the morale of our troops will drop, or that our enemies will get a boost, if we seek to find out where we went wrong," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In a democratic society, studying failure and success is a sign of strength, not weakness," he added.</seg>
<seg id="8">The memorandum provides for the interrogation of political decision makers and military officials before the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="3">"I am certainly concerned about the new allegations that North Korea has defalcated United Nations Development Program (UNDP) funds," Ban told reporters. As for the UNDP, it said the American allegations "do not match" the results of its investigations accurately conducted six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">It announced that it has asked the chief of the United Nations General Assembly Consultative Committee on Administrative and Budget Issues to continue studying this case, and that it would look into "the possibility of sending auditors to North Korea."</seg>

<seg id="7">A primary audit report on the activities of United Nations agencies in North Korea, published last week, said it did not find any element allowing for the confirmation of these American allegations. However, the report revealed "some practices (in North Korea) different from those applied in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Hamas movement's control over the Gaza Strip will be at the heart of the talks that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will hold on Tuesday with American President George Bush in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before his meeting with Bush, Olmert, who arrives on Sunday to the United States in his 13th visit in 13 months, will meet with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon in New York, the American presidential candidates, and Jewish-American leaders.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Palestinian issue will be the focus of the talks, and what happened this week in the Gaza Strip shows that it is an urgent issue," Olmert spokeswoman Miri Eisin told Agence France-Presse.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Bush and Olmert will discuss means of supporting (Palestinian President Mahmoud) Abbas," she continued.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We hesitated about the two-state solution (Israel and Palestine), but it seems essential to us to move forward, in light of the issues that are currently put forth," said a senior Israeli official who asked that his name not be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="7">A source close to the Israeli government said that the American administration seems incapable of regarding the Palestinian file and has no choice but to help Abbas "without knowing how to do so, because of the prevailing chaos."</seg>
<seg id="8">After Abbas announced the dissolution of the Palestinian National Unity government and the assignment of its Minister of Finance, Salam Fayad, on Friday to form an emergency government, Israel announced its willingness to resume "full cooperation" with the new government, including the financial aspect, if it acknowledges the Hebrew state.</seg>

<seg id="2">A state of alert was announced among the Lebanese army troops and the international emergency troops (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon on Monday, a day after two rockets were fired on northern Israel for the first time in ten months.</seg>
<seg id="3">Armored vehicles from the Lebanese army and UNIFIL troops patrolled the road running parallel to the Israeli border, while the army and police set up checkpoints in the border zone, an AFP correspondent said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Two rockets fell on Sunday afternoon in the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, 10 kilometers from the Lebanese border, causing minor damages and leaving no victims.</seg>
<seg id="5">The launch of the two rockets, the first operation of this kind since the war between the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah and the Israeli army in August and July 2006, raised tensions in Lebanon at a time when it faces a series of attacks and fierce battles between the army and the Fath Al-Islam group in the Nahr Al-Bared refugee camp in the north.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israel accused a Palestinian organization, which it did not name, of launching the two rockets. Meanwhile, Hezbollah denied any connection to the operation, and the Lebanese government vowed to track down those responsible.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Al-Saniora announced that, "The state, through all its security services, will not spare any effort to find the party behind this act, which aims to shake the stability" of Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="8">UNIFIL believes that the launch of the two rockets represents a "new gap in the truce," which has been in effect since last summer, per Security Council resolution 1701, which calls for all parties to exercise restraint.</seg>
<seg id="9">The aforementioned international resolution put an end to the military struggle between Hezbollah and Israel in southern Lebanon, after Hezbollah fighters gained control over it.</seg>

<seg id="5">"Some of our recommendations have been accepted, at least by the Germans," the Polish prime minister told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The difference between Poland and Germany is no longer very large. There are problems with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="7">Poland thinks that the double majority voting system, which is stated in the constitutional treaty, gives a lot of power to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The treaty states that decisions should be made by a majority of 55 percent of member-state votes, representing 65 percent of European Union residents.</seg>
<seg id="9">In place of this system, Poland suggests applying the "square root" rule to calculate the population of each member-state, considering this form more fair. "Simply stated, what we want is moderation," said Jaroslav Kaczynski,</seg>

<seg id="2">"Europe, with defense budgets that together are much less than the American budget, can no longer afford five surface-to-air missile programs, three fighter jet programs, six offensive submarine programs, and more than twenty armor programs," Sarkozy said in a speech he delivered at the Le Porge exhibition for aviation and space industries near Paris.</seg>
<seg id="3">In this regard, he alluded to the synchronization of the European Union program Eurofigther, from EADS European Group, the Rafale aircraft produced by the French Dassault group, and the Swedish Gripen programs.</seg>

<seg id="6">"As commander of the armies, I will strive to divide the work in Europe. Each country should provide its best technologies, rather than impressing its weaknesses," he added.</seg>

<seg id="7">He called for Arab countries to lend "more attention to the technical and scientific aspects of the field of security and to securing qualified individuals, equipment, and the necessary requirements to stop money laundering."</seg>

<seg id="4">The chairman of the Union of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce, Mohamed Al-Masri, noted that this agreement aims to automate the activities of the eighteen chambers of commerce, included in the second phase of the project, providing essential services to nearly 4 million merchants in all chambers of commerce.

<seg id="1">The stream of current events in the Palestinian lands confirm that Israel is the only one benefiting from the current situation, the result of the Hamas movement's control over security department headquarters in the Gaza Strip and the subsequent decisions of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen). These led to the emergence of two struggling forces, neither of which could control the other, because there is no geographic connection between them. In addition, Israel itself does not allow either of the forces to move to eliminate the other, something that Israel is expected to work to promote, because it serves its strategic interests and achieves an its old dream.</seg>
<seg id="2">If we go back a little, specifically to December 18, 2005, we will simply find the truth of this concept. In a session of the Israeli government that day, during his presentation on what is called intelligence surveillance, Aharon Zeevi (Farkash), the head of the Israeli Military Intelligence branch at the time, said,</seg>
<seg id="3">that it was possible for the Gaza Strip to turn into two Hamas and for the West Bank to turn into two Fatahs.</seg>
<seg id="4">He added, "We can use any expressions we want about Abu Mazen and his intentions, because he does nothing, but the result is that no results will come from him."</seg>
<seg id="5">"There are possibilities that the West Bank and Gaza Strip will turn into two separate geographic units in the year 2006," Farkash explained</seg>
<seg id="6">Certainly, Israel has helped one way or another to make the previous scenario a tangible reality, by agitating the struggle between Fatah and Hamas, directly or indirectly, because that serves its interests, regardless of the party that controls the situation in Gaza now.</seg>

<seg id="2">The newspaper noted that Blair's appointment has been approved and that representatives of the members of the Quartet (the European Union, Russia, the United States, and the United Nations) will hold a meeting in Jerusalem today, called specifically to appoint Blair, who will leave office tomorrow after ten years as British prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="3">The source added that the Quartet meeting in Jerusalem is supposed to make decisions regarding logistical issues, to make final arrangements, and to announce this statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The British newspaper added that America and the United Nations strongly supported this appointment, but other parties had opposed it. The newspaper stated that Brown, who will succeed Blair as prime minister, is very upset about this appointment. He had wanted to encourage reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis through economic means when he comes to power, and he believes that Blair's appointment will hinder that.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Berlin, sources in the German Foreign Ministry revealed that Germany is opposed to Blair's appointment as a new envoy to the international Middle East Quartet. The German government is trying to avoid a disagreement with the United States about this issue, however.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Egyptian Jihad movement is about to make an announcement these days on previous broader and deeper reviews that the Islamic group started ten years ago. In this framework, the issue of intellectual and movement review,</seg>
<seg id="3">raise real questions about its future and effects on the phenomenon of religious violence in Egypt and the world. This is usually given the adjective, "jihadist," to describe the process and those doing it.</seg>
<seg id="4">The main question around which speculations and concerns revolve with regards to the future is, will these reviews lead to halt or reduction in acts of religious violence and terrorism, from which Egypt suffered for years and from which the world is still suffering until today? Or will their effect be limited and the suffering continue?</seg>
<seg id="5">Actually, the answer to this question - the expectation - part of it lies in the question itself, as differentiating between the future of the phenomenon of violence inside Egypt and outside Egypt is considered the first lead to the answer and speculation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reviews, which the Islamic Group in Egypt started by announcing the initiative to halt the violence ten years ago on July 5, 1997, actually led to a total cessation of all religious acts of violence and features in this country from that group all this time, without as much as one exception since the massacre in west side in Luxor. This was committed on November 17, 1997 by members of the group who did not know about the initiative of its leaders and their decision to halt the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The importance in these ten years of the total cessation of violence is such that, in the life of this group, which is nearly three decades old, it represents a third, and not just a short period of its life, that some could consider an exception in a long history or a short truce that will soon end.</seg>

<seg id="1">On May 24, American President George Bush announced a new series of economic sanctions against Iran, following the International Atomic Energy Agency report, issued yesterday, on the increase in uranium enrichment in Iran and Tehran's failure to cooperate with the international agency.</seg>
<seg id="2">This announcement coincided with an announcement by his ambassador to the United Nations on the same day that there are disagreements in the Security Council preventing the implementation of previous resolutions on the boycott of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="3">The truth is that American sanctions against Iran go back to the beginning of the eighties, when American companies were prevented from conducting oil work there. These were followed by Congressional legislation in 1996, the "Iran and Libya Economic Sanctions Act," which imposed sanctions on foreign (not American) firms that invest more than $20 million annually in the oil industry in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="4">The sanctions against Libya were lifted after the dispute of the explosion of the American plane over Lockerbie in Scotland was resolved.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is obvious that the United States has not yet succeeded in weakening the Iranian oil industry, as was the case with Iraq in the nineties of last century.</seg>
<seg id="6">What has happened, though, is a use of continuous pressure to limit the natural growth of this industry and return to its former levels before the 1979 revolution.</seg>
<seg id="7">As is known, the production capacity of Iranian oil at the end of the Shah's era reached nearly 6 million barrels per day, dropping down to nearly 2.6 million barrels per day during the Iraqi-Iranian war, and then rising to 4 million barrels a day now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the export capacity has remained the same without changing for several years and is nearly 2.5 million barrels a day. In the last Iranian fiscal year, total oil profits reached nearly $54 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Yesterday, Israeli public radio broadcast some of the details of the discussions Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transportation Shaul Mofaz held with American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, noting the criticisms he received from Israeli diplomats in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2">The radio said that Mofaz had told Rice that Hezbollah had returned to southern Lebanon just like before the war, but its men did not appear along the border.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added, according to the radio, that the United Nations peacekeeping forces and the Lebanese army are not doing anything to disarm Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="4">The radio cited sources in the Israeli Embassy as saying that diplomats in the embassy are critical of Mofaz for ruling out a military offensive on Iran and for saying that the possibilities to influence Iran through diplomatic means have not yet been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="5">The same sources said that such statements by a top Israeli minister destroy Israel's efforts to keep all options open, including the launch of a military operation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Under the headline, "Ber Al-Sabaa within the range of Hezbollah," a report published by the newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, said that Mofaz had told Rice that after the second war in Lebanon, Syria and Iran had smuggled missiles to Hezbollah that could reach populated centers in the middle of Israel and part of its south.</seg>
<seg id="7">It added that Mofaz was citing "trusted" intelligence information that Israel has obtained.</seg>
<seg id="8">A missile expert said that Mofaz was referring to the Iranian-made "Fatah-110" missile, whose warhead weighs half a ton and has a range of 250 kilometers, which means that from southern Lebanon, it could reach the city of Ber Al-Sabaa in the Naqab desert in southern Israel.</seg>

<seg id="1">The ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Lebanon, Abdulaziz Khoga, continues his actions toward the government and opposition leaders, in a serious attempt to crystallize a political agreement that would end the current crisis and return stability to the nation, through an agreement expanding the government of Prime Minister Fuad Al-Saniora and transforming it into a national unity government.</seg>
<seg id="2">Khoga's communication with all parties comes within the framework of urging them to reach an agreement on a memorandum of understanding, especially as Saudi Arabia remains the country most capable of opening up to all parties. It is supported this time by French Ambassador Bernard Emié, Iranian Ambassador Mohamed Reda Shibani,</seg>
<seg id="3">American Ambassador Jeffrey Feldman, who has not ceased communicating with opposition leaders, and on top of them, Chairman of Parliament Nabih Beri and leader of the National Liberal Party, General Michael Oun.</seg>
<seg id="4">Khoga is keen, though as visitors have cited, to assert that he is not carrying out a political initiative in the name of his country and that his sole interest is for the parties to reach an agreement that speeds up the production of a national unity government in the womb of the current government.</seg>
<seg id="5">He has also refrained entering into discussions with any party. Rather, he is addressing everyone with one speech, calling them to support Arab and international efforts which support Lebanese-Lebanese reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also asserted that he is not representing them as they return to dialogue, and that he would not hesitate to provide every support to bring closer the viewpoints of those who should secure suitable circumstances to activate efforts to end the crisis.</seg>

<seg id="3">He did not reveal the content of these communications or how they were made, however.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mufaz, who was the former Minister of Defense, a commander in the army, and a member of the small Israeli security government, was commenting on information published by the Israeli newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, which wrote that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently told Syria through secret messages that he was willing to resume dialogue with it and to retreat from the Golan Heights that Israel occupied in 1967 and annexed in 1981, in return for peace.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I realize that any peace agreement with Syria will force me to return the Golan Heights to Syrian sovereignty, and I am willing to bear my responsibilities in order to establish peace between us," it stated that Olmert had said in one of his messages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It added that these messages were addressed to President Bashar Al-Assad via Turkish and German officials.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mufaz said, "As a result of the tension that currently prevails (between the two sides) and the last Syrian statements supporting peace, I believed,</seg>
<seg id="8">and I believe today that the secret channels allow us to probe intentions."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want to reiterate that previous peace agreements started with communications through secret channels," he added, in reference to the peace agreement with Egypt (1979).</seg>

<seg id="2">At the same time, the government announced that it has decided to appoint a high-level official in the Turkish Foreign Ministry, the diplomat, Refat Aq Junai, to the same committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is noted that this committee, which relates to the activities of the Kurdistan Labor Party outside of the Turkish borders, was established per an American recommendation more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time, Washington noted that the goal of establishing the committee was to help Ankara to pursue the terrorist groups targeting it. People close to political circles in Ankara, however, asserted that the real reason was to convince Ankara not to invade Iraqi Kurdistan, in order to pursue Labor Party fighters, who are taking refuge for their activities in rugged mountain areas, and to search instead for nonmilitary solutions, in cooperation with Iraqi and Kurdish leaders in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is noted that at this time Ankara has launched a series of threats to invade Iraqi Kurdistan, in order to pursue Labor Party fighters. The Kurdish leadership in Iraq, however, has responded that it would not stand with its hands tied in front of a Turkish military invasion and that it would take this to be an act of occupation and call for Kurds to resist it with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since Iraqi Kurdistan represent the only safe spot in an unsettled Iraq, the United States rushed to convince Ankara to give up military threats and resort to peaceful solutions based on the principle of cooperation with the Kurds of Iraq, in order to eject fighters from their strongholds and put an end to their military operations.</seg>

This drove the international community, represented in the International Quartet, to announce its full support for President Mahmoud Abbas.</seg>
<seg id="2">In spite of this, Washington denied any intention to halt emergency aid to the Gaza Strip or "to differentiate between Gaza and the West Bank." Washington has announced that it is studying a series of options to deal with the latest developments, which include reinforcing Abbas by achieving progress on the peace process track and improving conditions in the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="3">For its part, the Israeli government preferred "waiting, watching, and remaining alert," though the Gaza incidents speeded up approval of the appointment of Ehud Barak as Minister of Defense. Meanwhile, the head of the Hamas political bureau, Khaled Mishaal, assigned "primary responsibility" to the international community for the crisis between Fatah and Hamas.</seg>

<seg id="1">A specialized oil expert ruled out that the White House would accept a project to try OPEC states in American courts, on which the Congress (Senate and House of Representatives) voted, for the charge of manipulating prices.</seg>
<seg id="2">"The charge of manipulating prices was introduced by Democrat Herb Cole and Republican Arlen Specter and has been approved by the American Senate. It is not just against the states in the organization, but also against all oil producers in the world," said Emirati expert Ayman Seif in an interview with Al-Hayat.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Because the other countries outside OPEC are not mutually connected, however, they were accused as a large number of producers," he added.</seg>
<seg id="4">Seif does not believe that American President George W. Bush will approve this law, because it harms the interests of America and opens the door for other countries to deal with its products accordingly. It also does not respect state sovereignty and independence. This is a serious, unprecedented incident that has not happened before.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The request for such a law is not new. It first started in 1978, when a labor group sued OPEC under the law that fights monopolies. An American court of appeal rejected the case in 1981, however, since the members of the organization enjoy immunity against legal cases, because their decisions are those of sovereign countries. Then, the second attempt came in 2005, but the case was dropped before it was subject to a vote," Seif asserted.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Those who should be sued are the major oil companies (and most of them are American) for monopolizing drilling and refining technology," said Seif.</seg>
<seg id="7">Speculators in international oil markets are the ones who raise its prices, not the producing countries, and since the rise in prices is not the result of a lack of production, but of the failure of refineries in America to produce enough for the market there.</seg>

<seg id="3">He added that the others are four of the company's officials, including Sorour's sister, who is an appointed member of the board of directors, and two Ministry of Health officials.</seg>
<seg id="4">The People's Assembly approved lifting Sorour's parliamentary immunity in January (January).</seg>
<seg id="5">Sorour and the six others were subjected to an investigation by the Supreme Public Funds Prosecution regarding the discovery that thousands of blood bags supplied by the company do not conform to specifications in Ministry of Health storehouses, following complaints to monitoring boards from a number of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the referral decision, the prosecution stated that the two Ministry of Health officials had received blood sacks (packages) without performing a technical examination. They satisfied themselves with a physical examination.</seg>
<seg id="7">It added that defects appeared among the blood bags which caused a loss of consciousness in donors, as the level of blood flow was above normal. Blood clotting and the explosion of sacks also occurred during blood component separation.</seg>
<seg id="8">It continued, stating that defects in the bags caused bacteria to sneak into the blood of a patient (receiving the blood) and caused him bacterial poisoning that could have led to death.</seg>

<seg id="1">The British daily newspaper, The Guardian, and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) television surprised the whole world when they published details of the bribes and commissions received by Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, the former Saudi ambassador to Washington and Secretary General of the Saudi National Security Council, in the framework of the Al-Yamama arms deal which the Saudi government purchased from Britain for £43 billion, the equivalent of $80 billion, involving the purchase of Tornado and Hawk aircrafts.</seg>
<seg id="2">The details of how these commissions and bribes were paid are numerous, and have become public. They may become more clear, with audio and video, when the BBC broadcasts its televised program, including the result of investigations and meetings to discover the truth.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is not known, however, at least to the Arab reader, is the party who made this revelation and leaked the information to the media, and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before answering this question, we should go back a little, particularly to the personal interference of Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, who stopped the investigations into the deal and its commissions, which were conducted by an independent judicial committee, after the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia threatened to cut its relations with Britain, stop its cooperation in the war on terrorism, and withdraw from a new arms deal it intends to purchase from Britain for a total of $70 billion, which includes the modern Eurofighter aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tony Blair, who will leave his office in nearly two weeks, said he would bear the responsibility for personally taking this decision, because continuing the investigations would have led to the revelation of results that threaten British national security and harm relations with an ally country which effectively contributed to the wars on terrorism and Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Observer newspaper issued yesterday, on Sunday, disclosed that Tony Blair had approved the participation of British troops in the Iraq war, with full knowledge that Washington had not made the necessary preparations for the postwar phase and reconstruction operations in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2">The newspaper said that senior aides and close friends of the British Prime Minister asserted that Blair had repeatedly raised his concerns with the White House about this issue, but unsuccessfully.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also approved the participation of British troops in the Iraq war, even though President George Bush had personally announced that Britain could help in other ways.</seg>
<seg id="4">The paper noted this disclosure, which came in a documentary program that will be broadcast on Channel 4 television next Saturday in two episodes, will raise many questions about the Blair's assurances to the British public when the war erupted in March 2003 that he was satisfied with plans for the post war phase in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="5">It cited Peter Mandelson, a former minister in Blair's government, as saying in the program that the Prime Minister Blair knew that preparations for the post war phase in Iraq were inadequate, but he could not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="6">For his part, Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's special representative to Iraq, asserted that Blair was in a state of despair...and was tearing his hair out over some deficiencies and failures.</seg>
<seg id="7">Greenstock stressed that the failure to make the necessary preparations led to an acceleration in the deterioration of Iraq, and said, "I felt this country was slipping away from our grasp from the beginning.

<seg id="4">"The government subsidies that we want to prohibit maintain inefficient production capacity in industries ranging from steel to semiconductors," she added.</seg>

<seg id="6">These negotiations take place within the framework of the Doha Development Agenda, according to a statement released by the office of the American Trade Representative.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American proposal would prohibit the following five types of subsidies if they are "specific," which are only given to a particular company or industry and benefit a product that is exported or competes with imports:</seg>
<seg id="8">-- Coverage of operating losses;</seg>
<seg id="9">-- Forgiveness of government-held debt;</seg>
<seg id="10">-- Lending to "un-creditworthy" companies;</seg>

<seg id="2">In statements he delivered here on Wednesday, Khamenei described the presence of the Iraqi people in the elections as matchless, adding that, "Those who oppose the elections are actually opposing the interests of the Iraqi people. America, Britain, and unfortunately some of the countries of the region come on the top of these groups that oppose the interests of the Iraqi people."</seg>
<seg id="3">Khamenei expressed his country's willingness to provide the necessary support to the people and government in Iraq to return security to the country. He added that America opposes close ties between Iran and Iraq and seeks to prevent the establishment of strong relationships between the two countries, but these attempts should be faced.</seg>
<seg id="4">He considered the most important problem in Iraq to be the presence of occupation forces and the lack of security and noted that America is arming terrorist groups in Iraq. He added that these procedures will one day become a burden on American troops,</seg>
<seg id="5">just as it armed some groups in Afghanistan, and these groups became its enemies. He referred to America's attempts to create division in the region, especially in Palestine, saying that what is happening in Palestine and the pressures that the elected Palestinian government is facing are concerning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Christchurch, June 29 (Xinhua) Twenty-two new sites were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, and one website was deleted, during a committee meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="2">The director of the United Nations-funded organization, Francesco Bandarin, said today (Friday) that the World Heritage Committee added the new sites during its session, held in Christchurch</seg>
<seg id="3">The new sites include 16 cultural sites, five natural sites, and one mixed cultural and natural site, raising the number of sites inscribed on the World Heritage list to 851 sites.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an unprecedented decision in the history of UNESCO's Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the committee deleted one of the sites, the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary, from the list , because of Jordan's failure to preserve the prominent international value of the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following the additions made this year, the UNESCO World Heritage list includes 660 cultural sites, 166 natural sites, and 25 sites mixing both.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is noted that in 1972, UNESCO adopted the World Heritage Convention as a way to encourage the identification and protection of the world's most prominent cultural and natural heritage sites.</seg>
<seg id="7">This convention, in which more than 183 countries participate and which includes more than 830 sites, is considered to be one of the most widely supported United Nations' conventions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Who would throw his money into our stock market explosion at the present time?</seg>
<seg id="3">I would advise every owner of capital who wishes to make his money profitable and secure to invest it in real estate, such as apartment buildings and leases. I swear, it has great benefits and, God willing, it would be much better than the bankrupt market. This requires patience, however.</seg>
<seg id="4">Does a man achieve a sublime status except through patience and perseverance?</seg>
<seg id="5">And here I wonder, if the market has been in decline for two months and some shares have lost much of their value - for example, shares in Al-Masafi were 280 riyals just three weeks ago and are now at 192 riyals, i.e., a decrease of 88 riyals in only three weeks - can this be called a market?</seg>
<seg id="6">The agricultural company Ha'el was 39 riyals three weeks ago and is now 25.50 riyals. This means it lost 13.50 riyals in a short period.</seg>
<seg id="7">Imagine a man who owns 10,000 shares. How much would his loss be in such a short period of time, let alone those who have more shares?</seg>
<seg id="8">You can add many shares to that, but this is what I had in mind about this stupid market.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am not talking here about the falling index and prices, since it was once worth 20,966 points. I am only speaking about a period of three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investment funds that are supposed to at least maintain capital, let alone make a profit, have lost much of their value, causing a loss to some of them of more than 75 percent of their capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">The price of the Al-Raid Fund had reached 97 riyals per share and is now circulating in the thirties, as far as I know. What kind of investment is this?</seg>
<seg id="12">The original price per unit of the Asa'el Fund was one riyal. People were desperate to invest in it. Now, it is worth almost a quarter of a riyal per share.</seg>

<seg id="1">Due to some incidents involving fraud, swindling, armed robbery, the occasional use of arms, and occasional murders, which a few Saudi tourists experienced recently, especially following the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon, there has been a lot of talk and warnings against traveling to Syria, especially for tourism,</seg>
<seg id="2">I think it is sometimes beyond the scope of an event to warn against travel to Syria for tourism, to take Syrians lightly, and to make the majority of the Syrian population content with what is happening to tourists, or at least given the Syrian government's policy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everywhere else on the planet, there are bad and evil individuals, in Saudi Arabia, in Syria, and everywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this country, Saudi Arabia, we have a lot of security problems,</seg>
<seg id="5">but we are used to focusing on others and forgetting about ourselves and the problems we are experiencing,</seg>
<seg id="6">Those with a desire to verify what I am writing can go and spend an hour at the nearest police station to witness the volume of complaints, disputes, violations of rights, thefts, and other things,</seg>
<seg id="7">although the state recently became aware of this security defect, which has been ignored for years, due to security forces' focus on terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="8">Evidence of this is the high number of cases of hand chopping this month, to prevent the spread of theft, which unfortunately has become a widespread phenomenon throughout the kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">If we in a rich country, such as Saudi Arabia, are suffering from the spread of theft, by concealed or coercive methods, and the occasional use of force, do we blame a poor population in its entirety, because it has few criminals?</seg>

<seg id="2">It is painful to see such a downfall and this failure in facing the issue of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is also painful for man to feel an intellectual alienation for which he can scarcely find an intellectual impetus with a realistic and convincing presentation, to which he can escape from his alienation.</seg>
<seg id="4">We would not reach far, nor go beyond the realm of the nation, to identify the features of this disgraceful and shameful collapse, which confronts an issue. When it first showed up, we used to say that this issue had no connection to our social and cultural reality.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, some of us even used to say that those Saudi terrorists were nothing but a misled grouping, who did not acquire their ideas and their ideological extremist modality from the culture of the community.</seg>
<seg id="6">Masses from among Saudi society are largely convinced that this deviant group does not have any foundations and intellectual and ideological bases to nourish its ideas and push it to the fire of terrorism and its hell.</seg>
<seg id="7">So people felt good with each security success in which terrorists fell, as butterflies might fall to the light of lamps.</seg>
<seg id="8">The firebrand of terrorism has not been extinguished, despite the impressive successes of security and despite the considerable support of mandatory counseling, which was applied to many detainees in cases of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="9">Saudi society has been perturbed as a result of the terrorist acts, which led to material and intellectual damage, which followed simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="10">We started noticing this intellectual strife and conflict among a large number of symbolic intellectual currents, the exchange of charges, the accusation of betrayal to foreign states, and the accusations against some preachers for supporting terrorism and extremism.</seg>
<seg id="11">The contents of the last statement from the Ministry of Interior, in arresting a group who provide intellectual and material support to terrorists, clearly reflect the magnitude of the tragedy in which we are living.</seg>
<seg id="12">It makes us ask what have we accomplished after all these years in our fight against terrorism?</seg>

<seg id="2">The media campaign against the authority now is similar to the media campaign against Iraq in relation to weapons of mass destruction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everyone knew that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction, but with the passing of time and with continued and organized media pressure, a sort of total internal conviction was generated in the minds of the people of the inevitability of the occupation of Iraq!!</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, whoever had arranged for this campaign against the authority does not plan to highlight the shortcomings of the authority or to solve personal differences. They aim for more than this, though.</seg>
<seg id="5">They aim to create an internal conviction among the people to give up the authority. Of course, this requires a gigantic effort from the media. Here, you see how the media is striving desperately on daily basis!!</seg>
<seg id="6">Now, I say my piece with the help of God. Are there any mistakes in the authority?!</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, the authority has shortcomings from its head to the soles of its feet, and we shall not enter into the boring details that are circulated by the people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main mistakes, as I have seen with my own eyes, is that there are many men from the authority who deal directly with the public. They are selected for their religiousness, and God knows best.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is an important aspect that has been overlooked, which is related to the psychological and social aspects of how to deal with the public. These are not laws to be applied, but rather, winning the public over.</seg>
<seg id="10">From my point of view, for instance, it is better for a man to go voluntarily to the mosque than to go under duress after being whipped and insulted. Compare this matter to all of the mistakes of the authority and the alienation of many people as regards such matters!!</seg>
<seg id="11">Many of the men of Hisba should understand that their work is not about the laws and regulations that must be applied, as it is about winning the affection and conviction of the public.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the crux of the matter. This is exactly what our greatest Prophet did, blessings of God and peace be upon him!!</seg>

<seg id="2">Does Ismaiil Haniyeh realize the meaning of the king's wrath, due to the foolish act you carried out recently!!??</seg>
<seg id="3">Hey man, hey Ismaiil Haniyeh, Iranian dollars will not benefit you as you execute your heinous act!!</seg>
<seg id="4">What else? Some other Arab brothers want Saudi Arabia to provide more than it has already provided in terms of political stances and generous financial support, such as the last agreement in the holy city of Mecca under the patronage of the crown prince, may God protect him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Eventually, the agreement ended with the betrayal of Ismaiil Haniyeh and the tearing up of the agreement document, due to the low, despicable, and materialistic cause, a few dollars from Iran in exchange for the disengagement of the Mecca Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is considered a kind of futile, immoral, and foolish surge on the part of Ismaiil Haniyeh against his occupied homeland and to damage the security of the people of his homeland, subjecting them to collective international punishment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wasn't Ismaiil Haniyeh aware of this? What does the wrath of the king mean to you? It was caused by your breach and betrayal of the Holy City of Mecca Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="8">Has the agreement ended, as if it were merely intended to be ink on paper?</seg>
<seg id="9">As he began to disengage from it before the ink of the pen with which he, Ismaiil Haniyeh, had signed it had dried up.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is the outcome of that flimsy play that he performed??</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a kind of deduction of which he was not aware. This is, of course, due to his slow-witted intellect, ineffectiveness, and his failure to estimate the seriousness of the situation concerning the security of his occupied homeland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Haniyeh also misused his position and his movement, which he claims is Islamic,</seg>
<seg id="13">when that movement created fear and terrorism in the spirits of the sons of his homeland.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, his guards entered the offices of the organization and searched the office of Yasser Arafat. It was a disgusting scene and is considered a form of anarchy and organized crime!!</seg>
<seg id="15">In the eyes of Haniyeh and whoever shares his opinion and encourages him, is the great faith of Islam acts of terrorism, criminality, and a lack of ethics?!</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, the Hamas movement is a terrorist one, after it sought destruction, nothing but destruction, and unfortunately, against the land of Palestine!!</seg>

<seg id="4">Is this feasible?</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a large amount, as these large amounts of money were transferred from our country in only two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is only an affirmation that our country still has a lot, a lot, of foreign employees.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also evidence that many of the senior positions in the private companies are held by Lebanese people.</seg>
<seg id="8">They are managers and supervisors, who are paid double the salaries of Saudi young people.</seg>

<seg id="12">If a billion dollars were transferred during a short period, then how much money is transferred during a year?</seg>
<seg id="13">I read that Saudi Arabia is considered the second largest country, after America, from which money is transferred, taking into consideration differences in area, the number of citizens, and the number of foreigners in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that our country loses a lot of money every year due to the exodus of money from the country, thanks to those traitorous businessmen and others who prefer foreigners to Saudis, without a thought of the nation, its interests, and the interests of the citizen.</seg>

<seg id="2">* The Egyptian Coalition against the Death Penalty has expressed its concern on the continued implementation of the death penalty in some countries of the world,</seg>
<seg id="3">at a time when the total number of states that have abolished the death penalty has reached 128 countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">In one of the most prominent countries in the Arab world, the most heinous crime took place, that is, the execution of three of the leaders of the Iraqi former regime.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Iraqi Criminal Court had sentenced Ali Hassan Abd Al-Majid, known as "Chemical Ali," Sultan Hashim Al-Taie, and Hussein Rashid Al-Tikriti all to death.</seg>
<seg id="6">In spite of the calls of many members of the international and Arab communities for the abolition of the death penalty, especially for political crimes and crimes of opinion, the court's ruling was issued under unusual conditions and by a court belonging to a regime that came in the wake of the occupation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, the verdict is described as being of a political nature. Unfortunately, this scene had already occurred before, in the execution of Barazan Ibrahim Al-Tikriti, the half-brother of ousted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as well as Awad Ahmed Al-Bandar, the president of the former Revolutionary Court, who was sentenced to death by hanging,</seg>
<seg id="8">whereas Barazan Al-Tikriti was executed in a manner contrary to all international and humanitarian norms. His head was separated from his body and flew a distance of 30 meters. * *</seg>
<seg id="9">The death penalty, of which we are demanding the cancellation, was implemented in a manner contrary to international and humanitarian standards. We noticed this matter in the execution of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on the first day of the last blessed Eid Al-Adha. This has caused resentment in the entire Arab world and lent sadness to this feast. * *</seg>
<seg id="10">To ensure a fair and just trial, it was required that those accused of war crimes be brought before international criminal courts or the International Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hence, the Egyptian Coalition against the Death Penalty calls for the international and Arab communities to reconsider the death penalty, the extent to which it relates to the human right to life, and the abolition of this penalty where mistakes cannot be remedied.</seg>

<seg id="2">The decision of the Mauritanian Ministry of Culture and Communications, which required the expulsion of the representative of the Western Sahara from an official activity supervised by the ministry, came after the Moroccan ambassador to Nouakchott objected to his presence, which had caused widespread resentment among some sympathizers to the Polisario Front. He considered it a departure from the principle of neutrality, which Nouakchott has maintained throughout the past years.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a statement to the daily newspaper, "New Science," a member of the Sahara delegation, Mr. Mohammed Abdi Wuild Ibrahim, expressed the disappointment of the delegation at the action taken by the government, considering the hardships that he and his colleagues had endured due to the road journey.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asserted that the Mauritanians had prevented them from showing their tapes in Mauritania, in spite of the excellent relationship between the people.</seg>
<seg id="5">In his opinion, the Mauritanian government may have agreed to expel them in advance and to prevent them from taking part in any activity.</seg>

<seg id="4">Meanwhile, the number of Internet clubs in Morocco, which have become favorite spaces favored by young people, has exceeded 10,650.

<seg id="8">Especially in Andalusia, one notices in this country what a tourist does not notice in our country, except in some southern cities, namely the palm trees sweep Andalusia, stand tall, and are being planted all over the streets, alleys, public squares, along the coasts, and in the city centers.

<seg id="9">Rather, there are new tasks for existing challenges for both Egypt and its regional security, as well as Hamas and the presidency, whereby the two adversaries could have drawn a plan to find common ground to face the emergence, by the simplest definition and without complexities, of radical fundamentalist groups in the Gaza Strip. These could undermine the political program of the presidency and Hamas, as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">No doubt, there is a divergence of views, tactics, and strategy between Hamas' program and Al-Qaeda's ideology.</seg>
<seg id="11">As for the presidency's program, those extremist groups, if the expression is right, consider it a program that is absolutely in favor of America and Zionism.</seg>
<seg id="12">These groups deal with this program with a logic that calls others unbelievers.</seg>

<seg id="2">Operational tests began on three new projects for drinking water in Al-Rimayah, north of Al-Ahram, and Ousim, which will be opened within days.</seg>
<seg id="3">These new projects increase the amount of water produced in the governorate of Giza by approximately an additional 346,000 cubic-meters, to serve 1,435,000 citizens in the three areas. The cost of the new projects is 196 million Egyptian pounds.</seg>
<seg id="4">This announcement was made by Engineer Hussein Khaled, the chairman of the Executive Body for Drinking Water and Sanitation in greater Cairo and Alexandria.</seg>
<seg id="5">He indicated that the three projects come to achieve the objectives of the electoral program of President Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that the first project is a pipeline from the Imbaba Station to Al-Rimayah. This will serve Faisal Street and the adjacent areas, from the eastern and western sides, the Al-Rimayah area, and the Al-Ahram Gardens, for about 360,000 people, with a length of 26 kilometers and a daily production capacity of 100,000 cubic-meters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The second project is a pipeline from the Imbaba Water Station to Ousim. It serves Ousim City, its center, and some villages from Imbaba to the north of Giza, about 175,000 people. Its daily capacity is 36,000 cubic-meters, and its length, with all its attachments, is 10 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third project is to improve drinking water north of Al-Ahram and to serve the population of young people's homes, the Al-Ahram plateau, North King Faisal, and the Egypt/Alexandria Desert Road, at a cost of 95 million Egyptian pounds. Its total length is 181 kilometers and its a daily capacity is 210,000 cubic-meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is to be mentioned that Engineer Mahmoud Amer, member of the Muslim Brotherhood parliamentary bloc for the Ousim constituency, has submitted an application for the introduction of clean water to the city of Ousim, which has been approved, to fulfill the promises that he made to serve the residents of his constituency.</seg>

<seg id="14">The newspaper and television has announced that the issue of bribery was uncovered in an investigation carried out by the Office to Combat Fraud, based on information on bribery and corruption, as part of the Al-Yamamah Deal involving the purchase and maintenance of "Tornado" fighters.</seg>
<seg id="15">The revenues of the British group for this contract reached 43 billion pounds (84.4 billion dollars.) The British group admitted that it had offered Saudi officials "assistance services," saying that this was not in violation of British law.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lawyers for the company admitted to having offered "services" in a letter dated November 2005 addressed to the Offices to Combat Corruption, which at the time had been investigating the possibility of the receipt of bribes, while finalizing the huge "Al-Yamamah" deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia in the eighties of the last century.</seg>

<seg id="3">He indicated that he does not accuse this group.</seg>
<seg id="4">Murad said in an interview with the Al-Arabiya satellite channel, "Stability in Lebanon is achieved via a national unity government, through which the aspect of security could be contained in a better way. These assassination cases would be controlled, and the perpetrators arrested."</seg>
<seg id="5">Walid Eido, a representative of the Lebanese Future Parliamentary Bloc, was killed earlier on Wednesday in an explosion targeting his car, which also led to the death of his son and four other people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Deputies in the anti-Syrian "March 14" Coalition Bloc made accusations to Damascus of standing behind the assassination, just minutes after confirmation of the death of Representative Eido.</seg>
<seg id="7">Murad said, "Political assassination is not a policy of the Syrian state. It denies and condemns it."</seg>

<seg id="3">while Prime Minister Fouad Siniora has called for the evacuation of the remaining civilians from inside the camp, in apparent preparation for the final strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">A military source described the fighting as more intense than usual in the Nahr Al-Bared Camp, where the army is fighting battles for the fourth week running with the Fatah Al-Islam group, whose approach is inspired by the Al-Qaeda organization.</seg>
<seg id="5">At least 136 people, including 60 soldiers, were killed in the heaviest fighting since the civil war, which took place between 1975 and 1990. In addition, 11 soldiers were killed, and more than a hundred were wounded during the battles that occurred at the start of the week.</seg>
<seg id="6">The army clashed with Fatah Al-Islam fighters on the outskirts of the camp, which was the home to about 40,000 people, before the outbreak of fighting, which forced thousands to flee to the nearby Al-Biddawi refugee camp. Regarding the evacuation of the rest of refugees, aid workers are struggling to evacuate civilians who are still trapped inside the camp,</seg>
<seg id="7">while Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora has requested that civilians who have not yet left the camp evacuate it, "in order to preserve their lives," in response, "to their appeals."</seg>
<seg id="8">Siniora called for caution, however, as to, "the possibility of transition of the elements of Fatah Al-Islam and their exploitation of the eviction process, so as not to expand terrorist acts outside the camp."</seg>
<seg id="9">On another matter, the Lebanese army denied the news, which reported that armed elements believed to belong to Fatah Al-Islam had kidnapped two Lebanese soldiers from one of the streets of Tripoli and the claim made by these elements that this was to ensure their safe exit to the Syrian border, in exchange for the release of the kidnapped soldiers, promising not to harm them.</seg>

<seg id="2">The American film is in jeopardy of disappearing from Egyptian cinemas, after reigning from the eighties to the present. The cause is the emergence of new competitors promoting European films, especially French films and East Asian films.</seg>
<seg id="3">A major company known for its well-calculated adventures has also been successful in obtaining authorization for the showing of Indian films at the same time that they are shown in India.</seg>
<seg id="4">There were different views on this issue. Antoine Zanad, the distributor of American films in Egypt, stressed that the showing of European, Indian, and Korean films is only a temporary phenomenon and will come to an end,</seg>
<seg id="5">especially as they are randomly administered and, therefore, would not stand up to American films and will not shake its primacy in the Egyptian cinemas.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zanad attributed the presence of Italian films in the sixties and Indian films in the eighties, the first being in that period, when distributors of films depended on the Italian community in Egypt or those Egyptians of Italian origin.</seg>
<seg id="7">As for Indian films, they were more organized, and there was a specialized agent for such films. After his death, these films disappeared and were nowhere to be found.</seg>
<seg id="8">He stressed that American film will not be threatened by the chaos of the influx of films, because they are indiscriminate and unregulated. It will remain on the throne of foreign films in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Adel Adib, the managing director of the Good News Company, confirmed that he already has the authorization to show Indian films in Egypt, so that the Indian film would be shown at the same time it is shown in India, in coordination with the Indian companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, a plan and a study of the cinema market has been developed to intensify the marketing plan for the coming three years. There is also a similar plan for European and Korean films.</seg>

<seg id="3">The United States of America stands with India, in spite of its continuous rejection of the special international resolutions on the Kashmiri issue and its manipulation for more than half a century.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also stands with the Zionist entity, despite its continuing refusal to implement the special international resolutions on Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="5">The American government has not and will not exercise any pressure on India to resolve the Kashmiri issue, in accordance with the international resolutions.

<seg id="8">The resolution of the Kashmiri issue is based upon two fundamental focal points. The first is the resolution for the partition of the subcontinent of South Asia in 1947, which provides for the joining of the states of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan, a state with Muslim majority.</seg>
<seg id="9">The second is the international resolutions of 1948 and 1949, which provide for a referendum to decide the fate of the state, to accede to either India or Pakistan.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is clear from the name of the company that its owner did not trade in prohibited items, of any type, whether hashish or opium, or the banjo packets which have eroded the brains of young men. The company was not one of those shipping companies specializing in transporting Egyptians to the other world by drowning them in salty water.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also, the Sunrise Company was not specialized in importing the carcinogenic wheat, and Al-Ansari did not trade in contaminated blood and did not fight with people to sit on their chairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">If this is so, why this security attack on his company, closing it down and displacing its young workers?</seg>
<seg id="6">Informed sources have stressed that the aim behind the closing of Sunrise Press Services was made to be a matter of birth control, (!!) when the Ministry of Health and Population learned that the company had led young people to the verge of marriage, it immediately commissioned the regulatory authorities and security to control the situation and prevent these young people from marrying by closing down their only source of livelihood. Thus, they were prevented from breeding, in order that the Prophet Mohammed, blessings and peace be upon him, could not boast of them on the Day of Resurrection.</seg>
<seg id="7">The closure came one day after the allocation of 120 million Egyptian pounds for the purpose of birth control, (see Al-Ahram, page 1, History of Setback).</seg>

In addition, it is a measure significantly influencing democratic life in Palestine and limits to a great extent individual and collective freedoms.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together, in a copy of ... In a statement, the Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa List, the Al-Badeel List, and Independent Palestine List, the Palestinian National Initiative, said, "It is clear that this decree goes beyond all the laws set forth to ensure the freedom of action of bodies, institutions, and associations. It gives absolute power to the executive branch to intervene in affairs without undue legal or practical procedure, as stipulated by the Law of Civil Bodies and Institutions (1) for 2000."</seg>
<seg id="5">The blocs added that they took pride as Palestinians in the Law of Civil Bodies, as it embodied, letter and spirit, Palestinian democracy and the state of civil society, for which the law formed an important factor in its reinforcement and advancement, via the establishment of a civilized and enlightened society.</seg>
<seg id="6">The blocs explained, "We believe that passing the decree in the form it was issued created a major setback for democracy in our country. Therefore, we called them to back down from this decree and to stop working by it, in order to preserve democratic life in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="7">The head of the Palestinian National Authority issued a presidential decree which included a series of measures on the work of institutions, bodies, and associations.

<seg id="3">Perhaps the strangest thing is that plastic surgery, which may cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, is funded by prestigious banks in the country, such as the National Bank of Lebanon, in the form of loans.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to reports, banks receive more than 200 calls to inquire about these loans in any one day. These calls are attended by qualified staff in the field of banking and conducting discussions on plastic surgeries, which have begun, it seems, to "change the face of modern Lebanon."</seg>
<seg id="5">Perhaps the reality program, Beauty Clinic, which was recently screened on Future Television in Lebanon, has encouraged many women to go ahead and take up this experience. No lady or girl, or even young men, will have to suffer from any birth defects, or the like.</seg>
<seg id="6">Laila Obaid, the lady behind the Beauty Clinic idea, which depends upon the selection of a group of women who suffer from psychological or social problems, said that more than 10,000 ladies have applied to participate in the program, which was introduced earlier this year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Major General Burhan Hammad, the head of the Egyptian security delegation based in the Gaza Strip, who is leading mediation efforts between Fatah and Hamas, threatened to expose the perpetrators of the outbreak of factional fighting between the two movements in public and to name the instigators who caused the outbreak of the fighting by name.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also revealed that the delegation is preparing to head a people's march in the Strip, in order to stop the fighting, in light of the lack of response from Fatah and Hamas to the mediation efforts undertaken by the delegation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hammad appealed in a special statement to islamonline.net today, Tuesday, 12-6-2006, for everyone to stop fighting, so that he would not have to resort to the option of exposing the perpetrators who are fighting.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said, "In the end, I have to do something that I do not want to do. I will expose the perpetrators causing the fighting, and I will mention them by name. Therefore, I call upon them to stop fighting."</seg>
<seg id="6">People's March. Hammad revealed that the Egyptian security delegation is preparing to "organize a people's march within the Strip, headed by members of the delegation, to condemn the fighting, to stand as a barrier between the combatants, and to deliver a message to everyone that the Palestinian people are unified and insist on their basic beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="7">He noted that, "The march will bear only Palestinian flags and the Palestinian issue. It will not raise the flags of Hamas or Fatah."</seg>
<seg id="8">He added, "This march will call for unity and will confirm that the Palestinian people will not die and are still vibrant with life."</seg>
<seg id="9">On when this march will take place, Hammad pointed out that the delegation is still organizing it and will announce it soon. A call for a new meeting,</seg>
<seg id="10">Major General Hamad pointed out that, "The delegation will invite Fatah and Hamas to a second meeting to sit at one table and to leave behind their fighting status." He expected the announcement on the meeting to come later.</seg>
<seg id="11">Islamonline.net was informed that the Egyptian security delegation had failed in its attempts until Tuesday afternoon to bring the delegates of the two movements to sit at the same table.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some findings of the Israeli Ministry of the Interior reported the withdrawal of Israeli citizenship from 1,363 citizens of Jerusalem in 2006. This indicates an increase of 500 percent over the situation in the year 2005. It is unprecedented and the highest since the year 1985, since the adoption of the policy of withdrawal of citizenship from the Arab citizens populating the holy city.</seg>
<seg id="3">The organization ... by handing over ... went to the Israeli Interior Ministry, requesting that they reveal the number of the residents of Jerusalem whose citizenship has been withdrawn, bearing in mind that the citizenship of 222 citizens was withdrawn in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">It should be mentioned that the Arab residents of Jerusalem were granted permanent residency status, which gives them most of the privileges enjoyed by the citizens of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="5">Under Israeli law, the Jewish state has the right to withdraw citizenship from any Arab citizen among the residents of Jerusalem if he lives outside the country or in Palestinian Authority areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israel has adopted a policy of the collective withdrawal of citizenship from groups of Jerusalem residents since 1995, in the time of the ill-reputed Eli Suissa, who had served as director of the Jerusalem Brigade, at the Israeli Interior Ministry. The cancellation of the citizenship of the residents of Jerusalem has been exacerbated since Suissa was appointed as minister from the Fundamentalist "Shas" Party in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="7">Suissa persisted in throwing obstacles in the way of those seeking construction licenses among the Arab citizens of Jerusalem. This has led to a terrible housing shortage, compelling many to leave Jerusalem by force. They were thus deprived of citizenship, which was withdrawn under the aforementioned Israeli law.</seg>

<seg id="2">It seems that the fourth Gulf War is knocking on the door, threatening to throw the region into a burning inferno that cannot be extinguished with water or traditional methods. This is because its principal constituent is oil, gas, deep-rooted hatred, and the prospects of the use of unconventional weapons.</seg>
<seg id="3">The American-Israeli air maneuvers in the Negev Desert have raised the forces of momentum for analysis, warning of a potentially heated summer. Its parties are Tehran and its allies, and America, Israel, and their allies. The Russians did not miss the opportunity, warning the West by complicating Iran's nuclear file.</seg>
<seg id="4">When Moscow says something, it means what it says, because it provides technology and fuel to Iran and is the owner of a vital field, whose carpets can be withdrawn gradually, with Washington's determination in Central Asia, where eight states have become independent from the former Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the indications of war, all diplomatic means are obscured. Europe heralded and pursued these, but came out empty handed. Neither did the stick scare Iran's Ali Khamenei and Ahmadinejad, nor was the carrot attractive to the point of causing Tehran to salivate.</seg>
<seg id="6">America, which is preoccupied in Iraq, stands stupefied before the balance of the unseen. The surprises that deprived her of sleep in Baghdad make it cautious and skeptical in the face of the analysis of the CIA and the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is nothing easier than igniting and starting a war, but putting it down and ending it is not as easy an issue, because quick victories and the raising of white flags ended a long time ago. It is too late.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Iranian announcements came as the Gulf States are cooperating with the United States with missiles, to add insult to injury, and reinforcing the concerns of a nuclear Iran in the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, if the air maneuvers in Negev were an ominous message to Iran, Tehran's preemptive threats to its neighbors are a preliminary taste of the same logic.</seg>

<seg id="5">The fighting continued between the two factions, and when Hamas took control of Gaza and seized the headquarters of the Preventive Security.</seg>
<seg id="6">By the way, the executive power factions seized significant quantities of arms and ammunition belonging to the Preventive Security and the presidential guards.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have benefited from it from outside sources to create strife in Gaza and to assassinate Hamas leaders and its members.</seg>

<seg id="12">The matter was not accepted by the majority of the people, since it was a coup against legitimacy, especially after he formed an emergency government without the authorization of the Legislative Council, which is controlled by Hamas.</seg>

<seg id="14">As soon as he took this step, aid and relief started flowing.</seg>
<seg id="15">The mask was lifted, and Abu Mazen had deviated from his own conscience by giving statements not befitting his position as head of state.</seg>

<seg id="2">The basis of the function of all genes in mammals depends on daily, timely harmony.</seg>
<seg id="3">This study refutes the current theory, which says that only 10 to 15 percent of genes are affected by the biological clock.</seg>
<seg id="4">While it has been known to scientists for a long time that the temporal, daily harmony, or the temporal, daily natural clock, regulates the behavior of the human life, the study found that this daily clock dominates and controls all the functions of life, and, in particular, controls the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="5">Knowledge of the properties of the temporal movement of genes that play a role in metabolism is essential and fundamental to understanding the interactions of genes and the manner that they regulate health and disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">The researcher, Petitson, says, for example, that, "When following a food diet of any system, you know that you should not eat late at night."</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, we can know why.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have discovered that all genes undergo qualitative changes in an activity pattern during the day.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each corridor in the genes' activity is affected by the temporal clock schedule or by daily, temporal harmony.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is an importance to the timing and synchronization of this harmony for each group of genes.</seg>
<seg id="11">The researchers also found short and long versions of some genes oscillating in the other direction.</seg>
<seg id="12">These genes are basic and essential components for the system of signals of the hormone, "Leptin."</seg>
<seg id="13">The pattern of fluctuation varies for the various members,</seg>
<seg id="14">to determine the impact of "Leptin" to regulate the balance of energy.</seg>
<seg id="15">The provision to further understand the nature of gene fluctuations provides researchers with solutions to develop ways to deal with people who eat more food than their body needs, due to an imbalance in Leptin indicators.</seg>
<seg id="16">Temporal and daily harmony is a (melody), a biological vital harmony during a 24-hour period of time, which works to organize the period and the time for most of the physiological and behavioral functions, such as sleeping, eating, and activity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Parliamentary sources disclosed to the news today, Sunday, 24/06/2007, a decision made by the new Mauritanian authorities to close four major Mauritanian embassies abroad, the most prominent of which was the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan, while the president reserved the right to close the embassy in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="3">The source said that the parliament had received confirmed information two days ago that the president had decided to close the following Mauritanian embassies, under financial, not political, pressure: the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan, the Mauritanian embassy in Japan, the Mauritanian embassy in Britain, the Mauritanian embassy in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2005, he had refused to close the Mauritanian embassy in Tel Aviv, in spite of its financial cost, about twenty million ougiya, because of its political character, which has raised much debate in recent years between the authority and its opponents.</seg>
<seg id="5">The same sources said that the general opinion in the parliament opposed this decision, especially as the Mauritanian embassy in Jordan is more important, due to the existence of a Mauritanian community, mainly students, in Jordan,</seg>
<seg id="6">in addition to the economic activity and political character of the embassy. While there is an ambassador in Tel Aviv (who may take over the community's affairs in Jordan,) it will render its closure a disgraceful procedure and harm pan-Arab relations, especially as this is the first time he has made such a decision, after the closure of the Mauritanian embassy in Iraq when the former Iraqi President was accused of undermining security inside Mauritania, according to parliamentary sources.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Mauritanian government needs the parliament's approval of the budget of any Mauritanian embassy abroad within the general government budget, which is to be presented to the parliament in an urgent session.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the other hand, parliamentary sources regarded it as unlikely that the new parliament will approve the budget for the Mauritanian embassy in Tel Aviv, as it is considered a waste of the people's property in a matter that they have rejected at the outset.</seg>

<seg id="2">No sooner had a decade passed after the defeat of Germany and Japan in the Second World War, than they recovered from the wounds of their defeat, moving forward to rebuild themselves. They started from their comprehension of the balance of powers and the reality of the era following the war, until they became two economic giants regarded in the balance of the international powers. Meanwhile, as far as we are concerned, the defeat of 5 June 1967 is still pursuing us until today!</seg>
<seg id="3">The contemporary history of the Arab world in general, and the eastern Arab countries in particular, is a series of events that formed and made regular the outcomes of that defeat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat generated deep influences on all aspects of Arabs' lives. It was not just a military defeat incurred by the Arab armies, but also a comprehensive defeat of all the structures of the Arab community, that had been built, and of socialism, which was established, and of the development that had been achieved, and of the state of security, which had been constructed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The defeat was an indication, however, of a changing flow of events in the direction of more Arab decline and a historical turning point, the dynamics of which started to become clear and evident from the seventies of the last century until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The defeat was not an incidental moment in Arab life. It placed all the Arab nations on a slope. And the October War in 1973, which turned into a political defeat with successive consequences in all fields, could not rescue them from it.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, the Arab communities, which had achieved some modernization, retreated to the worst state in their history, that is, to a political lifestyle very similar to the lifestyle of the Mamluk/Ottoman dynasty. The most prominent aspect of this was the separation of governance and people, the separation of community and state, the recession of society, the coagulation of history, and the dominance of a classical ideology that stresses subordination, acquiescence, helplessness, abandonment, and fear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Love is a nice human feeling. It is the refinement man made to his natural needs, just like the case with food, drink, the need to security ... etc. Therefore, feelings and the experience of them are determined by the extent to which the individual is civilized. Here, as in everything else, is subject to the sovereignty of reason, which identifies needs and shows the way to satisfy them.</seg>
<seg id="3">Accordingly, I completely disagree with the great singer, Suad Mohammed, that love results from the heart or the eye, so that I must choose one among them, as she wondered and expressed perplexity in her famous song.</seg>
<seg id="4">Love, as anything else, stems from a need for it, and the mind is only an expression of the system to satisfy human needs, if this is the right expression. It chooses from among alternatives, in order to see which is best and most appropriate for the satisfaction. There are some who recognize this and some who do not.</seg>
<seg id="5">All metaphysical explanations of love result from a lack of recognition, from Cupid, passing through destiny, fortune, and fate, to what is written on the forehead, this prevailing concept in most of our romantic Arab songs!</seg>

<seg id="2">As if a terrible pain and a heavy concern had been cast on my back, I see the carelessness of the people of Al-Mahrousa as to what happened to one of their respectful representatives, and previously, to one of the reverend judges of Egypt by the brave men of Al-Adeli.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is it true that this event did not have any significance, as I thought, to most of the intellectuals, and even illuminated writers and the activists in Egypt? It was not even mentioned, except by some few writers, and none of the programs that we would think of as programs were a very good window illustrating the people with which it dealt with analysis and focus.</seg>
<seg id="4">I say that if the representatives of the lower house of parliament, the highest authority representing the people, even though we confirm forgery, though, at the end, it is considered the major spokesman on behalf of the people and their representatives, and they represent the prestige of all of the Egyptian people.</seg>
<seg id="5">That such a vulgar act could happen to one of these representatives, that he should be dragged, kicked, and hit by a police officer,</seg>
<seg id="6">is a shameful, or rather, disgraceful matter. I did not even find the appropriate description that it deserves.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is more terrible is the reaction of the braggart criminal and the poor reaction of the victim.</seg>
<seg id="8">The victim, which is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who are the representatives of the people, regardless of their beliefs, raged and agitated their reverend council. Nothing else at all followed, though.</seg>
<seg id="9">Do you believe this?</seg>
<seg id="10">Yes, my dear, believe it.</seg>
<seg id="11">I will not say that what happened deserved an interrogation of the first person in the country and the person responsible for security in these territories. We have known them well, but I honestly say that you should have submitted an honorable group resignation to preserve the remaining prestige of your council and your nation. You disappointed us, though.</seg>
<seg id="12">For me, as an Egyptian citizen, I imitate what the symbols of the nation's security do. I look at you, the deputies of our lower house, with contempt, and I think that there is no harm of it if the street children hit and drag you, as others have done to you before.</seg>

<seg id="2">I started to doubt that the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has any political experience or an organized and aware mind endowed with foresight of the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="3">The regime wanted, whether it was aware of it or not, to divide the Egyptian people with an abominable and destructive sectarianism against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is what he called citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you search for the identity of that citizenship among the thinkers of the Mubarak regime, you will be amazed.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is, such a citizenship as belongs to the ideology of the regime says to the Egyptian people that you are not the people of one country. Rather, you are Christians, and others are Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="7">Muslims have the second article, and the others, the Christians, have the fifth article.</seg>
<seg id="8">They imposed disunity, whether or not they were aware of it, among the Egyptians, even in their book and the constitution of their country.</seg>
<seg id="9">One may say, "What is wrong with that?" Didn't that article - as regards the Islamic Shariah - make the Christians - the others, according to the regime's ideology - feel some worry, especially if the Muslim Brotherhood takes over the reign of Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="10">The regime, in this case, did not bring this sectarianism, as you claim,</seg>
<seg id="11">but it did the opposite and extinguished a concern among our Egyptian Christian brothers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, this looks apparently correct, but, I think practically in real life, it is not useful, I believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">It establishes more sectarian congestion among the people of one country.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this, you explicitly say to the brothers of the nation that you are a minority in a jungle, and that this article will protect you from the beasts of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="15">My inference might be incorrect,</seg>
<seg id="16">but the question is, "Is this going to comfort the others - the Egyptians in body and soul - however the regime perceives them in this way?"</seg>
<seg id="17">I think not.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if the regime repeals the second article of the constitution, the brothers of the nation will not be comforted. They would rather claim more.</seg>
<seg id="19">If more comes, it will not comfort them, and they will not be assured.</seg>

<seg id="2">He who contemplates the state of this country will recognize that its crisis is highly complex and complicated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most, if not all, of the vital sectors suffer from severe disorders and serious retreats every day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Moroccan University will not be an exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also suffers from many and several crises, which are hard to calculate or count.</seg>
<seg id="6">No sooner does a problem occur in a Moroccan university then the crisis becomes evident and its image and dimensions become clear.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is what has occurred in recent days, when violent clashes exploded in Agadir between Saharan students and others belonging to the Amazigh Cultural Movement of Ibn Zahr University.</seg>
<seg id="8">Soon, these clashes had moved to a great number of Moroccan universities, such as Marrakech, Casablanca, and Al-Rashidiya.</seg>
<seg id="9">The situation in the latter was more serious and congestive, because it witnessed the plummeting death of a student, as a result of these brutal acts, which are not to be accepted by any mind, nor assimilated by any logic.</seg>
<seg id="10">One university and successive violence.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the decade of the seventies of the last century, the left wing prevailed in the Moroccan University. This caused the Moroccan student movement to revolve in the orbit of communism and socialist beliefs, which witnessed great prosperity then with the existence of the great power at that time, the Soviet Union. It promoted the ideology of revolution and upheavals and supported it financially.</seg>
<seg id="12">That caused the majority of students to adopt these ideas and advocate them. The students, rather, stood side by side with the working classes, a towing van leading the communist socialist tide, which the world then was witnessing.</seg>
<seg id="13">At that time, the contravention of the planet and its failure to resolve in its orbit would expose brutal violence that reached its maximum limits.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some, here in Kuwait, think that the role of "the local cultured" should not extend beyond the scope of feelings of Occidentalism in the local environment and permanent anger about the general conditions, if such conditions do not conform to the individual perspectives of the cultured.</seg>
<seg id="3">What we know about the role of the cultured, however, is that they should bear on their shoulders two balanced burdens. One side should bear a message reporting the concerns of the ordinary citizen; the other side should look out to the future with optimism and caution.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this context, we do not think that the cultured are required to make feelings of Occidentalism in the local environment a fixed theme of their traditional and instructive role.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is, we should admit that some of us seem to get used to appearing as eternally angry with their rudimentary societies, according to their description of the environment in which they grew up, and that they, those who are angry, expect nothing but what is tragic and melancholic in the general procession of the society to which they belong.</seg>
<seg id="6">Others reveal only what they believe as positive aspects in their societies and close their eyes against what should be corrected and repaired.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, you see this other type of the local cultured people appear as if they live in Never Never Land or an eternally happy, smiling, and optimistic utopia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rationalism or the traditional area in which local cultured people work in Kuwait should be balanced, foretelling others of that which is negative.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a role also accompanying the proposal of practical solutions for the daily problems faced by Kuwaiti society. At the same time, the local cultured people should foretell about a coming future, which is happy, successful, and full of hope, if this or that trend suggested by the cultured person is followed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Every now and then, there are loud calls accusing Shiites of a lack of nationalism and saying that their loyalty is to Iran, not to their countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">This empty accusation, of course, has resulted from a number of causes, but the most prominent of these causes is that some of those producing these loud calls are ignorant of the fact that the main cause of the loyalty dispute is down to the issue of the imamate or consultation. From this stems the issue of loyalty to the ruler or loyalty to the land.</seg>
<seg id="4">As for some others who accuse Shiites of loyalty to Iran, they ignore the law of instinct, which says that man, whether he is Shiite or Sunni, by instinct, loves the homeland in which he grew up.</seg>
<seg id="5">He who peruses history a little will find that the accusation of Shiite disloyalty is not something new. Rather, it has existed for hundreds of years, and it originated from the fact that the Shiites believe in the theory of the imamate, while the Sunnis believe in the theory of consultation.</seg>
<seg id="6">And, of course, this is not the time to explain the theory of the Shiites and Sunnis, but I say, after the absence of Imam Mohammed Ibn Al-Hassan (AJ), the twelfth Shiite Imam, Shiites had to refer to scholars who meet a number of conditions, according to the last message of Imam Al-Mahdi (AJ) before his absence.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such a scholar, to whom they should refer, could be from Saudi Arabia or from Iran or from Afghanistan, because the conditions mention the characteristics of the scholar, not his nationality. Meanwhile, the Sunnis have continued to rule with the theory of consultation. They believe that it is the ruler who deserves loyalty, whether this ruler is good or bad. After a period of time and the failure of the nationalist trend, and at the peak of the Islamic reawakening, a Sunni trend became apparent, which is the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is the time to dream to ask subdued questions and to smile at stories with which people are fed up believing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was my thought when my hopes dared to imagine that all the past defeats would end in the eruption of a new battle.</seg>
<seg id="4">My wound was not a result of frustration. Rather, it was a result of the silence which gives way to everything, even the substitution of Iraqi poets' poems with missiles of an American shelling or with the bullets of the governing militias, in a country that was the pioneer in the creation of the first law in humanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The sale of the victims' corpses in the "American-Iranian" Iraq of death is no worse than other stabs against this country. There is nothing of life which remains safe from humiliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now, it is the turn of the dead to pay the bill for being Arab.</seg>
<seg id="7">The price of settling of historical accounts- which is disguised in promises of democracy by the American administration and Iran or in the keenness of the interest of Iraqis who are killed daily by American and Iranian arms- is paid by Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="8">Iran still harbors a grudge against the Arabs for crushing the Persian Empire of Khosrau during the Caliphate of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab. Thus, the Persian hatred for the just Caliph and the Arabs has remained a part of beliefs and rites that cannot be described with anything better than Safavid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The American administration is fascinated with destroying the Arabs, seizing their riches, and making the Israeli dream come true.</seg>
<seg id="10">The daily events of Iraq are not only conflicts among powers for influence, but also the annihilation, in the full sense of the word, of a people whose memory is full of pain and of the Arabism of that country. It was there that the Arabs presented their best historical roles, when Baghdad became the capital of the Islamic world.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nothing has been achieved in Iraq but death and destruction. There is no hope but the Iraqi resistance, the patience of Iraqi people, and the awakening of its nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Who would triumph in the battle for the Arabism of Iraq, bearing in mind that the killers are a superpower and a grudging neighbor, and their ally is an Arab? On the other hand, the victim is Arab, Arab.</seg>

<seg id="2">The people were driven mad!</seg>
<seg id="3">It is nothing new to say that President Mubarak is the president par excellence of rigged elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">It does not happen, even if by way of chance, that elections or referenda should be held during his reign without being rigged.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last rigging of the Shura Council elections, however, was extremely impudent and very brazen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since this council is fragile, parliamentary life in Egypt is silly and ridiculous. Most of the members of the People's Assembly and the Shura Council do not represent the people, so much as they use the people as a means for playing roles and lying to the people. Most of these members are employed to serve President Mubarak or the State Security Apparatus. None should become sad, then, for the failure of such and such to join the council.</seg>
<seg id="7">No live conscience or pure person would succeed in the face of the cooks and tailors of the laws.</seg>
<seg id="8">No jealous person could bear to listen to two speeches from Mufid Shihab or Abd Al-Ahad Gamal Eddin without falling dead.</seg>
<seg id="9">I say so to inform you that if fifty candidates from the opposition win in the Shura Council elections, they would not be able to counsel or change anything.</seg>
<seg id="10">The problem does not lie in the victory of a hundred candidates from the opposition in the People's Assembly elections or the victory of fifty candidates in the Shura Council elections. Rather, it lies in a war inside a closed chamber.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a nutshell, I would like to draw the attention of those who witnessed the elections, to the fact that the rigging this time took a very new impudent path, to the degree of shamelessness. This exposes the mentality which rules Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="12">First, they flagrantly rigged the elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">Second, they did not fear shame.</seg>
<seg id="14">Third, they lie.</seg>

<seg id="2">Poetry is a literary genre, a utensil in which the poet pours his inconsistencies in the mornings and in the evenings. It is the spirit's mirror, the extraction of thought, and a contradiction between the mind and the soul.</seg>
<seg id="3">As is generally known about literature, it teaches and enjoys, a binomial equation with an impossible solution. It does not end.</seg>
<seg id="4">Poetry is eternal until Judgment Day, unstoppable by an era or a trouble. It is, rather, the trouble by which the spirit's inner secrets, the secrets of nature, and intelligence motives halt. It is the sleeplessness which never runs out and the language which has leaves from time to time,</seg>
<seg id="5">showing the poet's inner feelings, which fluctuate between the ebb and flow.</seg>
<seg id="6">The poet is an unusual creature, compounding different characters in his personality.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is he who can make every yes into a no and vice versa. He is the only one to change the desert into an orchard and an orchard into a burning fire under those who tread upon it.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is that creature who lives in every age. We see him but he can only see us through his texts, which embrace our dreams and soothe our wounds.</seg>
<seg id="9">The poet is a very sensitive person towards things, even inanimate things, feeling them, while we do not.</seg>
<seg id="10">He predicts everything, writing and reading us at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="11">He broadcasts his creative signals through the continents to remain alone with hundreds, and even thousands, of people around him.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was and is still gaining a high reputation in his community. Didn't we see how interested they were in poets in pre-Islamic times, in terms of narration, as if he were the tribe's spokesman? Now, he is the world's spokesman, if his works become universal.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was not easy to reunite the Tunisian journalists for discussion and the exchange of opinions on a critical subject on which much ink has been spilled and about which much was discussed by all channels and resources. It is related to the existence of a representative union to defend journalists.</seg>
<seg id="3">The existing union, which was established a few years ago and is considered by many activists in this arena to fulfill this purpose, has the ability to correct the critical, filthy status of those working in the written media sector. It has experienced a number of difficulties, which prevented it from adopting the needs of its supporters and from engaging in the battle to defend them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The authority was not far away from restricting the union's existence, considering the great number of obstacles which were set up ahead to weaken and nip it in the bud. This was not easy, however.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was subject to resistance by all the journalists, who expressed their limitless determination to adhere to their union as a body capable of framing their interests, negotiating, and addressing the authority and the managers of newspapers, in order to meet their needs.</seg>
<seg id="6">There was no choice left for the workers with respect to the press union to correct some faults, which corresponded to the establishment phase, but to join the Tunisian General Union (the only labor union in Tunisia) as a suitable pathway to patch up and avoid differences through which the fellows had lived this way.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the occasion of the examination period, I republished this article.</seg>
<seg id="3">It happened that I proctored university students for some examinations in the College of Arts at one of the Arab universities.</seg>
<seg id="4">I am new to university examinations, too.</seg>
<seg id="5">I passed my last university examination the year preceding my first proctoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was aware of the students' tricks to cheat.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was aware of the diligent and careless students.</seg>
<seg id="8">My view was changed, however, after I became a guard, not the one guarded.</seg>
<seg id="9">I have become acquainted with the depth of the drawback and the danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">I personally used to prepare for examinations full of doubt, fear, and fright.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, I wouldn't enter the examination hall before I had memorizes by heart, studied, and comprehended the material to be examined.</seg>
<seg id="12">I never thought to cheat, and I don't even think I would have been able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="13">If I had happened to ask one of the students about an idea I had forgotten or a question that I didn't understand, or something like that, I would have found myself trembling and would have attracted the attention of others.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I submitted myself to accusations, or at least placed myself under suspicion and doubt.</seg>
<seg id="15">After I became a proctor, however, observing students and bearing in mind it is a responsibility, and as per a beginner's seriousness and strictness,</seg>
<seg id="16">I realized that some methods of cheating had never even come to my mind, not only the methods of cheating, but the student's personality, as well, so much so that cheating has become a culture whose methods and techniques are exchanged among students.

<seg id="2">An administrative phenomenon that one of the biggest businessmen sarcastically suggested - I would like to rephrase it in the form of a direct question - why don't intelligent people keep on with their employment?</seg>
<seg id="3">My answer here is simply because their directors are less intelligent.</seg>
<seg id="4">How?</seg>
<seg id="5">A clever person in field of business does not seek a limited income, nor superficial duties. Instead, he looks deeply into the deepest strategic visions, in order to help build up his own status and society, if he is noble. This and that realize the slightest details of the way they are taking.</seg>
<seg id="6">Creative people agree to set phased periods for their financial, social, and cognitive development. This differs from one creative person to another, as much as the flow of creative energy in his vessels does.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some set a phase of a two-year period, and others suggest five years,</seg>
<seg id="8">while others set twenty to thirty years as a development phase. In this case, his development would be slower than others.</seg>
<seg id="9">The clever are distinguished by a large amount of flexibility and capacity for intrepidity and adventure.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are the three percent of the people who lead the world now.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is not easy. They lack financial stability and are more vulnerable to criticism and sarcasm for the many setback events they face in their life.</seg>
<seg id="12">They soon control the situation, however, making the other 97 percent gape in surprise.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patience is one of the features of clever people, but this doesn't mean that they should remain under control for periods of so-called stability, mostly due to a revolt that features them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their patience depends on the period of deepening within their minds and the availability of opportunities to act out.</seg>
<seg id="15">The clever accept that the precious may be sacrificed to obtain that which is more precious.</seg>

<seg id="7">While we all know the method followed in our countries to arrive at the council of representatives, (which along with the council of ministers are the two paths of the Shura Council in its work and practice in our countries),</seg>
<seg id="8">in which money, partisanship, and tribalism play a very important role in the fevered contest to reach the council. As a result, some illiterate, semi-educated, and superficial people, those whose ideas are few and who have nothing to offer, reach the council of representatives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet most of them fail to attend most sessions, and their loyalty to the council of representatives becomes just a high, official position and a diplomatic passport which they boast to bear in view of the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">In two ways that are followed, there is a big difference. The Saudi Shura Council is a scientific, technocratic council specialized in giving strong and important opinions to society and rulers there, because it is made up of the most highly-educated, knowledgeable, and scholarly men. They never may reach the position by money, tribalism, or partisanships, but rather by their education, standards, expertise, and dignity.</seg>
<seg id="11">In our council of representatives, however, we know some representatives whom we have never heard talking in a year. From the beginning, they do not attend.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even with their presence, we find that the blocs highly and directly affect the opinions of many members. Thus, we hear their opinions as identical to those of their blocs - right or wrong - whether these belong to the ruling party or the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">With respect to the Saudi Shura Council, it is based on the principle of honoring the existing ruling system and the ruler, and offering him counsel and advice as a good retinue.</seg>
<seg id="14">It considers partisanship a crime and plurality is rejected. Nobody in the Shura Council seeks to rival or disfigure the ruler.</seg>

<seg id="8">Most of the participants agreed that there is a relationship between wealth and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not a condition that every rich man should necessarily be corrupt, though, nor that he made his fortune through bribery and the abuse of power in illegal ways.</seg>
<seg id="10">For my part, I tried to lend a political dimension to the topic.</seg>
<seg id="11">The party responsible for the corruption of businessmen and their crooked role in society is the corrupt regime, because it allows businessmen to move from the slum to millionaires' quarters by facilitating deals, selling estates or selling one of the public sector's companies.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is unreasonable, however, to say things at a time when you have no conclusive evidence to support your claims.</seg>

<seg id="12">Playing on religious feelings, it managed to deceptively stimulate a number of Muslim Kurds to carry out its plan. As a result, the Muslim Kurds have been paying the price of such alacrity ever since.</seg>
<seg id="13">We, as Yazidis, were the only people to bear the idea then. Their thinkers and leaders, however, acknowledged that the stance was erroneous, and yet managed to convince the people and those in charge to spread and propagate the idea.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yazidism is known as a component of the Kurdish people. Yazidis are said to be non-Muslim Kurds, as established by impartial and objective historians.</seg>

<seg id="2">Citizens vehemently voiced their disapproval of the case of the Moroccan citizen who turned a public toilet in the town of Sala into a dwelling for him and his family,</seg>
<seg id="3">especially since authorities in the Ministry of Interior listed the address on his identification card, which officially recognizes his place of residence. They found no harm in giving him a national identification card carrying the address of a public toilet.</seg>
<seg id="4">In so doing, they disregarded principles of human rights and integrity, and ignored all state-supported slogans.</seg>
<seg id="5">When Al-Jazeera Channel hosted the head of Sala's Civilian Group in Bab Al-Moraysah to comment on the situation, it bothered me a great deal to see how clumsy and confused the Moroccan official was while dealing with the stream of questions from the news presenter.</seg>
<seg id="6">He gave little explanation, saying only that the group possesses documents to prove that the concerned person was only the toilet keeper,  that he is living there by force, and is preventing other people from using the facility.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authorities were to blame for issuing him a residence certificate bearing the toilet address.</seg>
<seg id="8">Our friend here is referring to the representatives of the local authority, namely the major and commander from the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Moroccan official confusedly reiterated the words "accounts" and "conspiracy", as he himself did not know what conspiracy or accounts he was talking about.</seg>
<seg id="10">In short, that official failed to provide any interpretation. Above all, he repeated the mistakes and blunders of his likes who maintain "the welfare of citizens". It is indeed a flagrant human and social scandal.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is evident in the compelling arguments and proofs, as well as the acknowledgement of the General National Security Administration, which issues identification cards, and naturally, the Ministry of the Interior. This blatant argument is addressed to those who claim that Morocco provides for,</seg>
<seg id="12">those who refute all contentions about injustice, oppression, exclusion, marginalization, and even trampling over human dignity, and those who make claims for human rights.</seg>

<seg id="2">Afterwards, Amr Moussa, Secretary General of the Arab League, headed a delegation on an official visit to Lebanon to assess the situation there and meet with Lebanese leaders. He intended to hear and exchange various points of view, reach a possible conciliatory formula that parties may accept in support of the Lebanese domestic situation, and attempt to end the incidents on the banks of Al-Badir River. The incidents have intensified after recent events.</seg>
<seg id="3">The matter remains stagnant. After all, many people and even Lebanese politicians were counting on the visit to recover and re-establish, albeit meagerly, the security and stability that Lebanon has long missed. However, things did not proceed as leading Lebanese politicians had wanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if Amr Moussa had stayed in Lebanon for a month or two instead of a day or a two, he certainly would not have been able to fulfill the desires of the Lebanese people, who are still shedding innocent blood on their land. The land yearns for fresh water and not for bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everybody knows that foreign hands are pulling the strings of the game. It is no secret that principal Lebanese leaders are desperate to spare themselves the need to prove their respective points. Instead, they should pay attention to a main outcome that brings the Lebanese people under one slogan: "Security for Lebanon."</seg>
<seg id="6">Amr Moussa does not and will not have Moses' wand to enable him to drastically change things at a glance. The dark voodoos of Lebanon are incapable of eliminating the serpents.</seg>

<seg id="3">They came to look for those Israelis who defiled your site and disturbed the serenity of your moods throughout this site. You frequent this site day and night, where you differ, disagree, argue, agree and love in an atmosphere charged with discordant or harmonious forces.</seg>
<seg id="4">I also realize that some of you will organize their work and form their groups in order to regain the site's independence and free it from those who have taken it by surprise from its members, administrators, and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The political and partisan organizations of this site will embark on expelling the tyrannical Jews.</seg>
<seg id="6">Other sites will offer us a hand for liberation by calling for a right of self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="7">They will use all their potential and means to expel the tyrannical invaders and hackers.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, advocates of the Maktoob nationalism will not agree to render their cause a public issue that other sites may take part in resolving.</seg>
<seg id="9">They will issue lawful judgments to the effect that this is a cause for Bani Maktoob, who already are connected by language despite having different sects and religions.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, no outsiders should be allowed to participate. There is a lot of disagreement, which are due to emerge on the seen between the local parties and pre-invasion wrangling factions.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is disagreement resulting from impulsive thinking, personal interests, ignorant fanaticism, and tribalism. If we refer this issue to God and his messenger, this disagreement would be settled just like God had fraternized between Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, the immigrants and those who supported them, and Arabs and non-Arabs in a united Islamic system adhering to God's righteous covenant.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day passed following the arrest of our neighbor, the poor employee. He was arrested because he either greeted a person in an election district or due to being overweight, which constituted sufficient grounds for a police-fabricated dubious case.</seg>
<seg id="3">A second day passed and it was filled with frequent news of arrests. Nevertheless, our neighborhood had not yet been honored with the establishment of a new detention center. Security helicopters continued to patrol the streets at night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shortly before the end of the second day, we heard gentle knocks on the door.</seg>
<seg id="5">We already went to bed in anticipation of an eventful morning. However, the knocks woke us up. We rubbed our eyes and looked at the wall clock to see what time it exactly was.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the knocks were gentle, we thought the knocker had to be one of our friends in need of some help.</seg>
<seg id="7">I left the matter to my husband and stayed in bed wide-awake and alerted.</seg>
<seg id="8">Few minutes later, my husband came in showing signs of astonishment and surprise. He said it was the son of our neighbor, the eminent preacher, who wanted to tell us that the security forces had just apprehended his father after searching the house and taking nothing.</seg>
<seg id="9">I involuntarily said, "God judgment suffices us, for He is the best handler of affairs".</seg>
<seg id="10">"What did those want?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"What connects our neighbor to the elections?"</seg>
<seg id="12">He did not favor betting on already rigged elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">He once published an article in which he called for concentrating on preaching activity and abandoning the political field for a little while until that chaotic period of the country's history had elapsed.</seg>

<seg id="9">During the last century, Hamas was at the pinnacle of valour.</seg>
<seg id="10">It had its share of responsibility towards the occupied homeland, just as its sister Fatah did, albeit with divergent approaches.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, this does not render Fatah an enemy. The enemy is outstandingly crystal clear. We hardly need magnifying glasses to see it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following the first line, which came to an end with Dr Abdul Aziz Al-Rantisi, may God have mercy on him, Hamas lost wisdom, acumen, and patience and won the elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">It won the elections,</seg>
<seg id="14">and it won the elections again.</seg>
<seg id="15">For months, Hamas government has been crawling and bungling, while the experienced and cunning Fatah is watching and issuing orders to undermine the clumsy politics of Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have always wished to see Hamas strike trouble-makers with an iron hand,</seg>
<seg id="17">but it never did. It is waiting until expelled Fatah officials assume leadership once again but under the mask of  Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="18">In return, people have been shedding blood as a result of Hamas's delinquency.</seg>
<seg id="19">Fatah took advantage of this very well.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has been recruiting, maneuvering, and plundering just to show Hamas as being weak and incapable of doing anything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Underhanded strikes continued while you, the head of government, Ismael Haniya, were acting in self-restraint at the wrong time. Management implies audacity; governance implies policy; and judgment implies acumen, wisdom, and an iron hand.</seg>
<seg id="22">You were holding seminars and being tutored by untrustworthy hands at a time you, Sir, were supposed to crack down on trouble-makers.</seg>
<seg id="23">You sought help from the black-turbaned ones.</seg>

<seg id="4">Fatah had numerous heroisms and a great deal of glories up until the events in Sabra and Shatella and the unconvincing departure from Lebanon to other regions in the world. There is also the notorious massacre that occurred while those troops were leaving.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unfortunately, that was an era, but we do not wish here to give more details about it because we do not mean to either vindicate or incriminate Fatah. I am not convinced by the scenario of the massacre.</seg>
<seg id="6">My friend, do not say that Dahlan owns a tower in Dubai. At least, I do not have any proof of this and there is no party to claim responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let us overlook the so-called intimate meetings between Dahlan and Zionist generals and Knesset members, which I believe were not used for the good of Palestine. This is the minimum level that Dahlan might be blamed for. If Palestine did not exist, Dahlan would not have been entitled to sit with and know such murderers. To say the least, he should have used his familiarity with them for the benefit of his people.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. President Abbas (Abu Mazen), I have never seen a president claiming to be a head of government that does not even own the land it exists on.</seg>
<seg id="9">What gives you the right to be a President? And what are you President of?</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Abbas. I was never against you. But surely that was only in the past. We, Palestinians, hardly need a weak and shaky personality that is even unable to assume its responsibility and to have enough courage to acknowledge its defeat. However, Sir, you indifferently accepted a sum of $600 million from the Zionists, and therefore, acquired an offensive odor to every Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian.</seg>
